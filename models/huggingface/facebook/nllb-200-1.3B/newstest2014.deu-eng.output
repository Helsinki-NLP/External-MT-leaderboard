Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian lighthouse was put into operation in Gutach at the village parking lot - within sight of the old town hall.
Two assets so close together, intent or schildburger?
The mayor of Gutach gave a clear answer to this question yesterday.
"The town hall was installed at that time because it secures the school road", Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel is safe for cyclists, bus passengers and Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially put into operation yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, a spa, the bus station, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the Grub residential area.
"The high traffic and pedestrian traffic meant that a further traffic light had to be added to ensure their safety", says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the Offenburg County Council.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B33, of which about 10 per cent are heavy goods", Arnold stresses.
The construction of another traffic light is therefore more than necessary: "Safety simply takes precedence here", says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a circular traffic was also considered, but again rejected because of the congestion at the junction of Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the choice of the lighthouse masts: "With a special for us transporter loaded with particularly long wooden logs, we tested whether these vehicles could go from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without knocking down the lighthouse masts".
The lamp system itself, which costs about 15 000 euros, is "the most advanced on the market today", explained Arnold.
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs, which shine so brightly that the lights can be clearly seen by the drivers, for example in the lowest sunlight.
It is also economical: the older lighting systems use about 100 watts, the new ones only eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: It is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, it's green for the pedestrian immediately, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be terminated for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled people cross the road, the green phase is extended, so everyone can cross the roadway safely", explained Arnold.
Of course, the driver must think along as a partner and watch the road.
This was not the case yesterday: as soon as the traffic light turned green, a luxury vehicle passed by - in bright red.
Josef Winkler has been writing his childhood and youth from the heart for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the penchant for crude violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and lack of pleasure - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Booker Prize winner is known primarily as a prose author, theatrical texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prose texts Gerhard Fresacher is putting together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Wetterlichter auf der Zunge Spitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X in Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003), for example.
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a crumpled couch, on which they seem to copulate and masturbate - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the script.
The 70-minute performance overshadows the set with a wealth of directorial influences, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses in particular are involved in the sometimes questionable stage adaptations.
They are touched hard, dipped in water with their heads, and their evening robes are covered with a wall.
Dressed in cellophane or cotton wool, they strolled dangerously high poles through the stage, either monologuing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
The text is hardly conveyed in this strenuous manner.
The best moments are the evening when the singing is done - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the exaggerated performance come to a rest, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes forth.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and they believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities, are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning agencies to overhaul the outdated system of financing U.S. roads.
The normally rather boring field of road planning has suddenly ignited an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and are advocating that the government use the little boxes to record the miles driven  and possibly where they were driven  and then use the information for tax returns.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about privacy.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently looking at how they can move to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
It's a must for our country.
"It's not something we're just going to use", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all California motorists in the state by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes is going to change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes Americans pay on the pump pile, is bankrupt.
But in America, they don't get as much gas as they used to.
Cars use less gas.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not been raised for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by even a penny at high fuel prices.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable", says Lee Munnich, an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
'This is the most sensible alternative in the long term', he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, for the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in a way that reduces traffic jams and climate-damaging emissions.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally-enforced climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Even the freelance marketers at the Reason Foundation are excited by the idea of letting drivers pay for the distance traveled.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole", explains Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former US transportation secretaries who in a 2011 report urged Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The US Senate approved last year a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to the concerns of rural MPs, who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or to the city in their daily lives.
Nevertheless, several states and large cities are moving in this direction on their own initiative.
The most committed is Oregon, which is currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one of these, too.
Illinois is testing it on a limited scale with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida), is currently looking into how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical that the government could track their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem", explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test began, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to track miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
Khan said that would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some government agencies to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company didn't originally pitch in to help states tax motorists.
Rather, it was aimed at establishing a foothold in an emerging market for motor insurance where drivers are expected to pay on the basis of miles driven.
But the devices she tested are also of interest to road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded", explained Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have been seriously flawed.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose not to use the device at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept to a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions rather than fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials are planning to develop a tax-paying device that will allow people to pay parking fees, insure themselves on miles driven, and collect real-time speed data from other vehicles so that drivers can avoid traffic jams.
Motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, according to a city planning document.
Some road planners wonder, though, whether all the talk about paying per mile is just a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other low-fuel vehicles, so that they too pay a fair share.
"There is no need for surgery if aspirin is enough", explains Randy Rentschler, Commissioner for Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, we're going to make hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and countless other things.
The small team is fighting hard
The volunteer fire department successfully completed their fall rehearsal despite a shortage of personnel.
Only 11 men took part in the exercise.
The department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise acceptance.
It's said to have been shorted during the sawing.
The resulting fire and smoke caused two injuries, but one of them was able to make an emergency call.
Two Wehrmacht air-protection personnel were preparing to enter the building after Hans Kammerer first checked the situation.
After a short time, the first person was found and led out into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not easy, since there was also a narrow staircase to be climbed.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
Then there were electric woodworking machines.
The first fire attack was carried out over the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was made over a spillway hydrant about 100 metres away.
Three extinguishing attacks have now been designed.
A hollow beam tube was also used in the building.
The aim of the exercise was also to show what could be done with a small number of staff.
In case of emergency, assistance is provided through the daytime operation group Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Networking between universities and firms is important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald county, the President of the Landtag, Guido Wolf, also visited Titisee-Neustadt to find out where the workers of tomorrow come from.
At the Hochschwarzwald Support Centre, he worked with the managing directors of the vocational schools and the district high school and the chairmen of the parents' council on this important question.
"Education is an important factor in location", underlined Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma school, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, a successful cooperation between the support centre, the district high school and the vocational school centre has been in place in the Waldorf-Stadt.
He also praised the family-friendliness of the district.
"It is important to keep an eye on not only the family phase, but also the care of relatives phase because of demographic change", Wolf explained.
It also stated that more and more workers were taking care of their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting stress on employees can lead to the termination of the employment relationship", said Wolf.
But nobody can afford to lose skilled labour, he said.
Another factor, particularly important, is the networking of universities and enterprises.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain their acquired knowledge and skills for the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region", the president of the Landtag was convinced.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the application of the principle of equal treatment for men and women in the workplace.
In his view, the advantage of the region is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also witnessed the efforts already made to expand public local transport.
"Keep your head up and make sure that public transport is better", he told the local politicians.
Music is a fun afternoon
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and a vesper afterwards.
In the past, the elderly were hosted in the rest home.
Meanwhile, this afternoon is being held at St. Joseph's Nursing Home.
The homeowners were looking forward to the delicious cakes and pies.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich used popular tunes to entertain.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall, which forms the front boundary between the old schoolhouse and Kirchstraße, is to be included in the city of Bräunlingen's rehabilitation cost plan.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first renovation works of the front schoolyard, a small angular wall was built to stabilize and statically relieve the over one hundred year old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step, according to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlingen City Planning Office, is to involve the Landmarks Office in the planning and to prepare a rehabilitation concept for the old wall.
The project is to be financed by the local authorities and the local authorities.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and planting of trees in the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the demarcation wall that needs to be renovated will have to be repaired from the ground up and replaced with new substructure in the foreseeable future.
The historic, hundred-year-old wall separating the old schoolhouse from Kirchstraße is in need of repair mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage and has an arch inclination to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse.
A strong wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard to be used by pupils, which has been achieved by the current work of consolidation.
The school's renovation was originally planned in 2008/2009, but was delayed due to high unplanned expenditure.
An important word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be the State Monument Office.
If the city of Bräunlingen comes up with a plan, it's hoping to get a grant from the conservation department.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught in a well-restored old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart
The continuing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg have now been joined by Cem Özdemir, the federal chairman of the Greens.
"I think it is wrong to abandon the holistic education at the Stuttgart Music College", Özdemir told the "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classical music are right at the heart of jazz in Stuttgart.
This is a clear contradiction to the Green-Red government, which is considered the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the Bundestag election on 22 September.
The Commission is proposing a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg on the basis of an expert study.
After that, the Jazz and Pop programme will be transferred from the Stuttgart Music Academy to the Mannheim Music Academy.
US border: 'Super-tunnel' for drug smuggling discovered
Investigators have discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling along the U.S.-Mexico border.
The U.S. Customs said the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad rails, and ventilation.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been used, according to the information.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig themselves under the radar", said Laura Duffy, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of California, at a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured them: "If you continue to build tunnels like this and try to use them, we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both the U.S. and Mexican security forces are engaged in a continuing battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crimes.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and that it took about a year to build.
The track was equipped to allow electrically operated wagons to be used.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
Authorities say a ladder leads 20 meters down to the tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable for encouraging illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the marijuana seized.
All three face the maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the San Diego press conference said.
But it's the first time cocaine has been found in a tunnel like this.
Usually cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA in San Diego.
They'd do anything to get to the U.S.
No details were given about the detainees, but at least one was said to be Mexican.
You're looking at a prison sentence of up to ten years.
2014 will be the year of Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer.
If the year ends in eight weeks, the jubilee year will begin.
Geisingen and Kirchenhausen were first documented together in 794.
A document was made in churches, mentioning both places.
The anniversary is to be officially opened on March 15, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, the opening ceremony will take place in Kirchen-Hausen, the place where both were first mentioned 1,250 years ago.
The anniversary will be marked by a number of events in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
The 1250th anniversary of the church is celebrated in July on a holiday weekend from 18 to 20 July.
Celebrating the return.
Friday with a feast, Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall.
This weekend also marks the Church-House Church Festival.
The city's music director, Rudolf Barth, has commissioned a composition for the city to be performed on three dates.
On 21 June, together with the Sonnwend celebration of the Black Forest Club, on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of the city music in the new festival hall.
It will be completed and dedicated in the Jubilee year, the official date being the last weekend of September, on September 27 and 28.
On the occasion of the city anniversary of Geisingen, a new chronicle is also being published.
"It is not only a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but also a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the geisingen of today also celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 was the space today with the enclosures completed.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
But 2014 is also a year of many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki will start on 8 February with a ritual evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will turn 90 and will have the festbanket on 29 March and then celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old Leipzig-Werk is celebrating 40 years, the Geisinger School has been at its new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen celebrates 150 years and celebrates this as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation deed held by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764.
The document was drawn up in Kirchen (Hausen), which was then the courthouse.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
In addition, the municipal reform is 40 years old.
Council takes aim at railway infrastructure
Should the Am Hirschen railway crossing be extensively rebuilt to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the council has decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in hand.
The German railway company wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
The aim is to increase safety at railway crossings - there are regular collisions between trains and other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the rebuilding measures, they must share one third of the costs, the rest being shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the specific features of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing.
The city plans to build a bay there, at the height of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
Larger vehicles, such as those carrying longwood, could also be in the opposite direction without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed that a necessary retaining wall be constructed so that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the town council, as some councils questioned the need for road widening: Thomas Kipp pointed out the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there.
The route also serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
Since it is foreseeable that the Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel will have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be of important transport importance for a longer period.
The councils agreed to have the costs of the proposed extension of the road investigated.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing, provided that the necessary retaining wall is built in such a way that the city can, if necessary, extend the subsequent road towards the 'Bahnhofstraße' to approximately 5,5 metres for intersection traffic.
The conversion of the railway crossing at Gerberei Trautwein, on the other hand, could entail a completely different problem, which concerns access to the rapidly increasing "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the railway's conversion plans examined by the engineering firm Breinlinger, as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would then be possible without further delay.
The investigation concluded that the inclination of the road could not be excluded as a result of the longer vehicles being left on the road.
The city, as the road construction operator, is responsible for this.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
The Commission also considered that the Commission should not be able to accept the amendment of the railway crossing, as both the timber conveyor and the bending works were functioning in the current state of development.
The risk of a collision between the train and a vehicle on the crossing is also significantly lower at this point than at the other railway crossings, because it is located directly next to the central stop, to which there is a good visual link.
Even trains from the central station would have to be so slowed down at this point that no collision is likely.
The majority of the votes were against the conversion of the railway crossing, as the city of Schiltach would have to "examine" the problem of the vehicles on the track, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the construction works were completed.
The Board considers that the conversion of the "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" railway crossings, for which interchange agreements with the railway have already been concluded, is not a problem.
ESA decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Distant planets, gravitational waves or black holes - Experts at the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they plan to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals were to be selected, five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets around other stars.
Whether there is life on some of them, no one knows.
The choice is hard: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for planets like Earth, and maybe find life outside of Earth?
These are the questions that the European Space Agency (ESA) is asking itself.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a major contribution to research.
The budget for such "L" missions is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were debated, five of which have now been narrowly voted on.
The Commission has also been involved in the preparation of the draft budget for the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1998.
A final decision by the Scientific Program Committee is expected in the next few days.
ESA has selected four key questions to answer for the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme, which was launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact process of star formation from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting them - is still a matter of proverbial obscurity.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, what are the conditions under which life can arise?
To answer that question, the Cheops space telescope is scheduled to launch in 2017 to study more closely 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres to look for "biomarkers", gases that are considered indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately designed to shed light on the conditions for the origin of life.
A key factor is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the radiation it emits with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied in an exemplary way.
With the Solar Orbiter, ESA has already approved an M-class mission (with a budget of about half a billion euros) for this purpose.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and will closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the evolution of the solar system.
ESA is planning the first of three L-missions under the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer probe is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is assigned to study the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto, and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to see if the laws of nature that we know are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory that would unite all known laws of nature.
How did the universe come into existence and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was formed by the Big Bang.
In addition to the familiar matter that makes up stars, planets, and living things like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters together, and dark energy, which accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, scientists do not know what physical laws were in effect in the first few fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With Euclid, ESA has already approved an M-mission, which is scheduled to launch in 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe is to study the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus making it possible to draw conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance of being approved as an L-mission, according to many experts, is the E-Lisa, a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand this as changes in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to date.
The scientists behind the project hope that Elisa could do it.
The mission will involve a detector consisting of two or three probes, which will be stationed in space.
Unlike the machines on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that formed during the Big Bang, providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called Athena, which will explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will detect and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, the exploration of the Moon, Venus and asteroids, and solar physics have already been rejected.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the U.S. intelligence service, has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele on Friday, he wrote: "Even though the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissenting opinions as a breach of trust and tries to criminalize political expression with threats of punishment, which are not defensible".
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the US government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of government property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make it possible".
Relations between the United States and Germany are strained by allegations that the NSA has tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the House of Commons who heads the parliamentary intelligence committee, said that the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness should be taken if possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden is testifying in Germany, he needs assurances that he is "safe" there, the MP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was subjected to a serious and ongoing campaign of persecution that drove him from his home country.
He was, however, moved by the worldwide reaction to 'my act of political expression'.
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians  including in the United States  have hailed the revelations about an uncontrolled system of widespread surveillance as a public service.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities cooperation 'if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation are resolved'.
Frontier Airlines charges for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers who want to store their hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, even though the announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it charges $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who pay at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is aimed at encouraging travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate that amount", she explained.
In 2008, airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers who tried to avoid these have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which has the result that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Charges are a way of encouraging passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
These are the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the Frontier airstrip may be allowed to take one piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the airstrip.
Frontier's new hand baggage fee doesn't go into effect until the summer, so there's no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about extra baggage and other charges, but airlines are happy to take action.
They argue that the transport of baggage costs money and that passengers should pay for this service if they wish it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are making enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have so far avoided charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and later it was followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost carrier.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary's Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit hand luggage fee brings in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former senior executive at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the gate when passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand baggage charge.
"The boarding process was one of the smoothest I've seen in my career in aviation", he said.
I expected to see grinding teeth and tangible discussions on the runway.
"The plane was full", he explained, "and boarding was smooth as a whistle".
Frontier is also following Spirit in the $2 charge for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company stated that passengers who bought soda or juice could keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for soft drinks in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontiers' move to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz between $10 and $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all airlines an incentive to get passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began offering half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the mileage was cut back to 25 percent of the flight path.
A third-party flight with a limit of over 1000 miles will therefore only bring in 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively for direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has been trying to get a handle on Frontier's finances as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs from the Bible
Some 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year at Bisingen's evangelical church congregation.
The theme of the day at the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Discourse from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the president of the church council, gave a talk on Bible proverbs after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain life-saving wisdom, precepts, or warnings", she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She used proverbs such as, "Look at the eye, and see, as the scales fall from the eyes, and cast an eye upon a man, whose Lord gives him sleep, and washes his hands in innocence".
On several occasions the speaker also asked her listeners to guess which proverb it was.
The medieval saying was adopted by the church member Christel Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, make a little.
She explained the meaning and origin of the phrases she called "bridges to the past".
The draw was made at the end of the event.
The prizes were laid on a table and humorously described before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also the mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: pilot project for the unskilled in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism sector was launched at the Mecklenburg lake plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who are already unskilled in the industry will be trained over three winters to become skilled workers in hotels and restaurants.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with diplomas", said Carmen Wiechert from the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are manifold: participants would not be unemployed, firms would have trained workers, who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the website's crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a bug had paralyzed their public website for several hours, not hackers, as was claimed online.
NSA.gov was unreachable for several hours tonight because of an internal error during a scheduled update, the spy agency explained in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening, online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website had been inaccessible for at least six hours, and that some users still do not.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network had been "in no way" compromised.
The spokesman said that there was no danger of confidential information.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have disabled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website crashes.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, once nicknamed No Such Agency, is now in the public eye and is facing sharp criticism following the revelations of its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance programme in recent months  a result of the secret NSA data stolen and released by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the intelligence agency fueled initial speculation that today's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of people without work fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the rate of 3.1 percent is better than last year and better than in September, "we would have hoped for more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the Sonthofen employment agency.
The Commission has also been able to provide a number of proposals for the future.
One reason is that, according to Felder-Bauer, "we have little skilled workforce in the craft, health care and nursing fields".
The seasonal situation has also led to the resumption of job offers in the hotel and catering industry since September.
In mid-December, the winter season begins.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäu Anzeigblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Loss of profits at Bombardier following decrease in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after being under pressure from falling orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial service in September next year, according to the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has so far been followed by only three more launches, which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is progressing as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts and led to a fall in the Toronto Stock Exchange by more than 8%.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" on Thursday, with a view to the stock having limited exchange potential in the next one to two quarters.
"While weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in transport", Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test programme for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft range will catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jetliner are true.
At present, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman of the Board, is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company's management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was on schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected", Beaudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were in place during the flight.
Every manufacturer has a different plan.
We decided to make a first flight and then add a period of revision, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, with the remainder shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts remain sceptical that the first customer will be able to take a CSeries aircraft into service 12 months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier stated that it was reviewing the EIS and would update it in the coming months.
"The slow progress of the flight test, although it is obviously in line with Bombardier's internal planning, reinforces our view that the start of operations will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015", said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended 30 September, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share from $172 million or 9 cents per share in the prior year.
Adjusted earnings per share is unchanged at 9 cents.
Sales declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a gain of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26.
The volume of orders in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September, unchanged from 31 December.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our target, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing", said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railroad manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector had increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The volume of orders in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on 30 September, up slightly from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts.
According to the management, new guidelines will be issued for the fourth quarter.
In Thursday afternoon trading, Bombardier shares fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 after it was also announced that Google CFO Patrick Pichette would be moving to the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday.
US: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown assailant opened fire at LAX airport Friday morning.
While airport officials announced via the short-news service Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media reports also reported several injuries.
U.S. President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, several media reported.
One traveler told CNN that many people had fled in panic.
Travelers would scream and children would cry.
The waiting crowd panicked, and many hid behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler to the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA security officer suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like a movie".
Afterward, he himself was taken to a secure area, the man reported.
The shots were fired near a security checkpoint.
Airport buildings evacuated
Television images showed numerous ambulances and police cars passing in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people have been evacuated from the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special operations team and a rifle lying on the ground.
The airport said on Twitter that the incident began at 9.30am local time.
The access roads were blocked, creating long congestion, according to CNN.
The air traffic was temporarily suspended, except for landings, it was said.
However, CNN also showed several planes taking off.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles LAX is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine lawyer who warned drug lord about police investigation goes to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, has passed information to the underworld giant Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come out
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense attorney who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction might be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld giant Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The "top-notch" criminal lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", was arrested in his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug case.
Officers watched Scarborough, 32, deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a bar council dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he unlawfully sought information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
All four suspects were then under police surveillance as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction might become public.
Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty at Liverpool Crown Court today after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was convicted after police discovered in their investigation of Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and place the 60 percent drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough was on the phone regularly with Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer went back home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It was revealed at the trial that Ditta was a 'regular user' of cocaine after tests detected Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed their discussion was under "lawyer confidentiality".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken.
During police questioning, he stated that he had an office at his private address as well as at his workplace and that clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was revealed in court that he had called major drug traffickers, some of whom he had represented before, for significant arrests and had informed investigators what they knew about them.
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you are not breaking the law".
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense attorney by getting too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the advocate for these persons.
But this went far beyond the boundaries of a normal lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has thus brought his professional reputation into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately".
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta made the leap from being a criminal lawyer to a criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organised criminals".
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and maintain public trust and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three cases for cocaine possession and obstruction of justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to traffic heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
Ditta posted a question-and-answer section about himself on his website, saying that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America, that his ultimate dinner guest was Muhammad Ali, and that inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
A revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations marking its 160th anniversary, the Liederkrans Dunningen will be surrounded by two services with Franz Schubert's "German Mass".
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience this spring, the Song of Songs will enrich two services at the end of the Jubilee year with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Mass.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary Mass will be heard during the evening Mass at St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, October 27, at 10:15 a.m. at the service at St. John the Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass, originally entitled "Songs in Celebration of the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its composition.
The Mass is performed in the context of the services, as the commissioner Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
The choir is led by Hermann Schneider and accompanied by the Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi's wind band on the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism is giving way to confidence
The parish council elections in 2015, for example, will change fundamentally in the Haslach (SE) psychological care unit.
There will then be only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
The day's events made it particularly clear that skepticism about the new was giving way, but increasingly, to confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 reforms to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees held highly constructive discussions with the main staff of the pastoral team.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt made a presentation on the new guidelines for the care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
The SE Haslach will then form a public-law corporation as a church community, which will be subject to the rights and obligations of the previous six individual church communities.
There will be only one joint parish council and one foundation council, in which the parish priest will be represented by the power of the office.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and six parishes will form local parish teams.
Their task will be to promote the life of the local church.
The question of the finances of the individual parishes then became a matter of considerable discussion.
The new rules provide for the preservation of the accumulated funds in the parishes.
The liabilities are transferred to the municipality as a whole.
There were serious concerns, particularly with regard to the large investments planned, which would then be the responsibility of all parishes.
"Even in the past, only projects that could be managed by individual parishes were invested", relates Bruno Prinzbach, chairman of Haslach's parish council.
The practical experience of a joint body for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairman of the body in the psychological care unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task of "Become one, stay five" in 2006 and had to realize that it was not so easy.
The Haslach Parish Council then set about answering questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The drafting will be further elaborated at further meetings and decided upon at a further joint meeting of all six committees next spring.
At the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the mental health unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is getting more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorps must adapt to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the municipal works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to SÜDKURIER, an extra cost of 70 to 90 euros per year is incurred by a family of four in Pfullendorp.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5,277 cents per kilowatt hour to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is re-established each October by the four operators of the major electricity lines.
They calculate the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can charge by a surcharge on the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf works are the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher fee in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipalities could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week.
"We're going to assume a raise of 1 cent plus x", Bias said, with the figure being closer to 2 cents.
Red light: Watch for waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street is not responding, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do, drive in red?
If the victim has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is clear, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time should be 'appropriate', which may be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises waiting at least five minutes before assuming a malfunction of the traffic light.
However, if you continue driving despite a red light, you must realize that you are entirely responsible for the accident that you cause.
If you wait less than five minutes, you may not be waiting long enough, warns Becker, and points to a decision of the High Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of running red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not faulty, but soon afterwards turned green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not a fine.
Municipal Council welcomes sound budget
Every time the budget is discussed at city council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not been in debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a successful one in this respect.
This was clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was more than one million euros higher than planned, at around EUR 7.6 million.
The administrative surplus is also about EUR 1.8 million, which is about EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipality's share of income tax.
The assets budget was again well above the planned values.
Last year, it was EUR 2.5 million instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget", says Rothmund.
As the investments made in 2012 were lower than planned, the provisioning of reserves was also higher.
The general reserve has been increased by some EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"You can't just shake a work like this off the sleeve", Gerster said, looking at the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were clearly pleased with the good figures.
It may seem paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon cost the citizens dearly.
The good financial situation has enabled the municipality to avoid high rates of levy in the past.
This, in turn, has led to frequent cuts in grants by the country, according to Gerster.
These grants from various compensatory schemes are subject to conditions.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain rates of levy.
"We need to look at the issue of levies, because in the coming years we will have investments for which we would like to have subsidies", Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's history at the men's choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was standing on stage as usual in the colors of his men's choir.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the now well-loved choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his loyalty to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Rottenburg-Stuttgart Caesarian Association, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - with a certificate from the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the certificate of the German choral association and an engraved tinplate.
Besides the honours, the 31st autumn festival was held in the usual way: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singing department Baisingen and the local music association, the Vollmaringer had a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Funny, your brothers".
In honor of their singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Lamb of the Union".
The men's choir Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Hunting" by Julius Wengert, "Far, far away" by Hubert Goisern as well as the folk song "When you pass through the valley".
The Liederkrans Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folk songs "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana", took Antos Gus abroad, while the "Impulchor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to the home field with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein presented the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side programme - "Aunt Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer played a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories, which kept the children busy for the afternoon.
Childhood dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centres in the customs district receive mail these days.
The Black Forest Commissioner, in cooperation with Bauhaus and the Zollernalb Savings Bank, wishes to assist the institutions in implementing their building and beautification plans.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
The action is open to all kindergartens, day care centres and day care centres from the whole customs union.
If you have a building or decoration request for your home, you can apply with it to the Black Forest Messenger.
Be creative with your kids and surprise the jury of the Action Kindergarten Construction.
A jury, made up of representatives from Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be fulfilled with construction materials worth a maximum of EUR 2000 and in one (action) day.
Moreover, the winner himself must provide many diligent construction workers.
What's with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus is providing the material with the support of the Zollernalb savings bank.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and the children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one can ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" read the newspaper, which considers the bill unconstitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which also owns CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament", he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government's new law effectively strangles the media, while The Standard says democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered a "grave blow", calling the bill "draconian".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the September attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media incurred the wrath of the authorities by publishing footage from security cameras showing the allegedly robbery of the luxury shopping mall by the units sent to the scene.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media figure to question him, although the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, as well as the additional risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the persons concerned if a fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single penalty can bankrupt most radio stations".
The newspaper also believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on what it describes as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
If they could silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"Nobody will ever know", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the Nation, who described the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"Leave politicians to themselves, they will bankrupt the country and return us to the time of hunters and gatherers", he commented.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the subject of public outrage in the past.
In May they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and restored their flat salaries of some Shillings 532,000 a month tax-free  among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream is coming true for FC
The official inauguration of the Kunstrasen sports ground, despite the cold weather and rain, did not diminish the importance for the city and the football club.
Everyone had hoped for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not keep one for any reason had the aftermath.
This was true of the musicians who framed the celebration, as well as many of the speakers.
The President of the Football Association, Albrecht Schlenker, was also wet, speaking of the fulfilment of a dream.
He thanked the Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who contributed.
Here in particular are Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The wealthy retirees laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new roads.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also recognised by Karl Rombach, Member of the Landtag.
Further greetings came from the city sports committee, Hubert Baier, the district president of the South Baden football association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation for the club's youth section.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
The first considerations for solving the problem were already made 15 years ago, when the idea of building a third place at the football club's site or at the Realschule am Salinensee was conceived.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, the idea of an artificial turf sports ground was conceived as the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning began two years ago when the FC took over the Schabelstube estate, pledged a contribution of EUR 100 000 to the construction of the site and the Land approved funding of EUR 104 000.
The municipality council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros of the total costs of 560 000 euros, Klumpp summed up.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial turf square began on June 4.
During the construction phase, which lasted over three months, 3,000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt bike path.
The Union and the SPD continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of home affairs and justice.
The working party responsible for this meeting met in Berlin this morning.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The working party on migration and integration also wanted to continue its deliberations in the morning.
The issue of dual citizenship, where both sides have different ideas, is likely to be one of them.
The SPD wants to end the pressure on German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
The Socialist Group has rejected a car-toll requested by the CSU on the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover the costs of the transport of dangerous goods.
The danger was that the country roads would be closed off and that they would be the scene of accidents.
The introduction of a toll on all passenger cars would also be a first step in Pronold's view.
"There is a risk that at a later stage the compensation for Germans will be cancelled", he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing fountain on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not the question on Friday night at the Killesberg open-air stage.
It was a truly tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for the hit star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car driver seriously injured in accident
A 37-year-old driver from Aachen was seriously injured in an accident on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a 41-year-old woman from Musch was driving her car on the Kempen ring road towards Grefrath at about 9:15 p.m.
When she was about to turn left on St. Tonier Street, she overlooked the 37-year-old's car.
The windshields collided.
The Aachen man suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blockage after accident at the railway station
The accident occurred, according to police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss sedan from Ibiza drove out of the city on the left-hand lane of the two-lane Reichenaut.
Shortly before the Schänzle circuit he noticed that he was on the left-hand side track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand side track.
The car was driven by a 23-year-old man from Konstanz.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old man driving behind the BMW was also damaged.
The police said that the damage was about 15,000.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it was further said.
Vienna Airport to end passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please report to Gate 24.
We are not going to have any more announcements like this at Vienna-Schwechat airport.
This eliminates much of the noise from the loudspeaker - the noise level is to be significantly reduced.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the airport is following an international trend in ceasing announcements concerning individuals.
For example, the airports of Copenhagen, Frankfurt and Dubai are already making noise-free calls.
The elimination of these announcements - on average, about 200 personal calls are made through the speakers per day - is intended to make the airport more quiet in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual reports have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information on changed take-offs or departure times is lost here a bit", Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander games at the cold farm
In addition to the tractor pulling, there is a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, at 1:30 p.m., the Highland Games are going to start.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they're Swabian in the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water-race.
The trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It's not about the size", explains organizer Peter Saile.
The stem must be thrown vertically, be overlaid once, and then come straight to rest.
That's the one with the most points.
When you throw a horseshoe, it's all about target accuracy.
From eight meters away, a stake is thrown.
Competitors must demonstrate skill and strength in carrying water over 50 metres.
Time and water in a bucket are measured at the end.
Two from each clan or team may then compete in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competitions receive prizes.
You can start training at 10 o'clock.
Appropriate clothing is desirable, for example, competitors may compete in the Scottish coat.
But Swabian clothing is also allowed.
For the outfit, the jury will award a few bonus points.
Registration is open up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there's plenty of action on the mainland on Saturday.
In the evening, the friends of the blues come at their own expense.
At 7 p.m., the beer-böhmische Blasmusik from Schömberg will be the main entertainment venue for the evening.
The choir plays fancy polkas and marches.
But their repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and the black sausage baron, will be there for a while.
In Dornhan, he's already performed at the Christmas market and the Fool's Club.
On Sunday the music club hosts Leinstetten for the morning, from 2pm the farm band Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the celebration.
The first is the Stoppelacker party with DJ Ralf on Friday.
Other items on the programme on Saturday and Sunday include the meeting of old-timers and hauliers, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Sunday's other attractions include the corn maze, the craftsmen's market, and the shearing of sheep.
There is a pet zoo, a straw hopper, tractor riding (guided) and tractor surfing especially for children.
The organisers are the Multi-purpose Halls Association, the Ski Club and the "Trigger Capsules" tractor club.
A look at milk and egg alternatives
A vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with vegetable cream, for example, is a substitute for quartz.
The World Vegetarian Federation also calls for World Vegetarian Day on November 1.
The Vegetarians' Association of Germany is proposing a number of vegan alternatives for World Vegetarian Day on 1 November:
Pure vegetable margarine is a good alternative to butter, and let soy yogurt replace yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk may be used.
The use of crushed vegetable cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half-crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple or one tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
Loose doughs are made with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water instead of eggs.
But even 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can do that.
According to the website Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany are currently on a vegan diet, i.e. a diet based purely on plants.
Sleepless in New York City
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Black Forest High School were introduced to the American metropolis of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we headed straight for the Brooklyn Bridge, which led to the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here, a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is particularly attractive in the evening light, was already available.
The time delay kept the students up for almost 24 hours, but in keeping with the motto "The City Never Sleeps", the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached by ferry and climbed on foot on the second day.
Then we went from the financial center to Wall Street to the 9/11 Memorial.
On the third day, the students were able to enjoy a view of the fascinatingly large city from the 1,300-foot-high (373 m) observation deck of the Empire State Building.
Then we passed through the busy streets of New York City, past Rockefeller Center, and Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School.
This year too, a Hubertus Mass will be celebrated on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
According to legend, St. Hubertus was a rather reckless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The Jagddreiter Westfalen horn group, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays old, originally French melodies on parforce horns (natural horns in the Es mood).
The Blowers wear riding clothes because they mainly accompany horsemen, horses, and dog herds on towing hunts.
The solemn mass will be held on Sunday, November 3, at 11:30 a.m.
The newly designed rooftop is glittering with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of visiting the café of the same name on the upper level in the district of Kleve within sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has just that as its goal: to make a real stay not only mental, but also tangible.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look inside the 8th floor gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel comfortable.
Here, the team, led by founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner, spoils the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variations.
There's delicious cake or fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, had already made a name for themselves as gastronomes before the opening of the ornate café on the upper floor: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
The move to Kleve is a big step forward for the sympathetic café-lovers.
Not least through college.
"We do not have a specific target group", stresses Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here wish to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all ages in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The lovely couple who own the place are behind the coffee-gathering.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in its many variations.
Other
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette is my thing", she tells NRZ.
We've already had two events at the Bright Café.
One, I should say.
The port party was held outside, and Café Déjà Vu didn't profit from it.
But there was also the night of the ringleaf.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that is why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event nights: "You can't do it for everyone".
And with an event, I always only reach out to those who are also interested in that particular event.
So events are going to be the exception.
"We want to disrupt as little as possible the normal operation".
I mean, déjà vu is also reliable.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opslag in Kleve.
The street that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many clerks, guests from near and far and students discovering the Gastromeile and thus Café Déjà Vu for themselves.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 to amend this Regulation.
A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation party to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the clubroom of the Witteborg restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Day is the appropriate time to pay tribute.
The special award "Singer of the Year" was this time enjoyed by the writer Rolf Wagener.
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also made many rounds for us, for which we are very grateful", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity bundles went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants each.
The fifth place is held by Artur Brückner.
The Board of Directors expressed particular gratitude to the team of the club's manager, Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again created a menu of the highest quality, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45 p.m. in the clubroom.
"We welcome new singing voices at any time", says Schlotmann.
UN announces new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty eradication announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off in Rio de Janeiro this evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the 'Sustainable Development Goals', which are to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which expire in 2015.
They have been incorporated in the final draft of the document which will be adopted by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think about national interests".
'I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal sustainable development goals', he said.
These goals will build on our progress on the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to implement the mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the Millennium Development Goals.
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball top-flight is still in good spirits.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
I hope we win again.
"Because I don't know what a victory like this tastes like anymore", Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even though the Third League reserve from Fredenbeck has not uprooted any trees yet, Malmon has raised his finger in advance to warn.
I've coached a lot of players myself in the A-youth.
So I'm sure they're gonna be very motivated against their ex-coach.
"We also have to wait and see if there will be any reinforcements from the first", explains the SG-Coach.
To finally get back on track, the Malmon team will definitely need to grow compared to their previous performances.
I mean, all the cover work and the switch game, it's been a big mess lately.
The use of opportunities must also be improved.
So I hope my players have finally gotten their heads around the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique grow amid clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to vote for peace in a rare public demonstration.
'We want peace, we want stability,' said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the future of the country, she changed her business clothes to a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks now, almost daily reports have been coming in of clashes between government forces and Renamo, in one of the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts say it is unlikely that the country will fall back into full-scale conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals alike.
The rapidly growing economy is facing a lot of risk, with the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest potentially bringing in over $50 billion in investment in the next few years from companies like Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Italy's Eni and the United States' Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamo, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, a Renamo spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who wants to use all his remaining strength to prove that he can force his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to the FT that he meant by this that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, and seriously", said Mazanga.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions, which were fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are head-to-head", says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good at negotiating and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a disabling movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been declining since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza  his resignation when his second term ends next year  wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency", Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key north-south link.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, a port that mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended railway use for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the line.
Mazanga responded with restraint to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique", said Mazanga.
The instability has added to frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already concerned about corruption, slow progress in development, and a recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems", he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads", he said.
One author says that children should be taught myths and legends as "models for life".
The stories of Thor showed that brute force has no chance against clever tricks, and the legend of Arthur demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are "far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools", which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that authors and teachers who are "overly didactic" would turn children off completely, because entertaining stories would convey the messages "under the threshold".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, explained: You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible.
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or have a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of right and wrong.
It must be subtle, revealed by history, not explained.
That's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to the free-for-all again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob retired to Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were brought to life in the "Freihof".
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely short-lived stage play.
From the time of his arrival, the awarding of the honorary citizenship, until his death, the screenwriter and actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play, which received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining connections and bridging time jumps from youth to impending retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hans Jakob comes home to his childhood heaven, to his free yard.
And then began the stage play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his role as the great son of the city.
He was a stylish driver with the double-spanner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received with great applause by the audience, but also welcomed by his sister Philippine.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly good at putting himself in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbach farm band played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
The honorary citizenship was then conferred on Haslach's mayor, Heinz Winkler, who was attending on behalf of the then incumbent Hättich along with part of the city council.
The singers of the Three Kings then made their way to the audience, and Hans Jakob exclaimed: "Oh, how beautiful it is to have youthful memories of my own Three Kings' time come alive again".
With their song "O little Jesus", they delighted the public in the courtyard as did the Storchentag children with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the Church had been expressed by Hans Jakob at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In his homeland, behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found peace and had gone home forever", the scene concluded.
The audience applauded the performance and praised it.
Basketball: The Hope of the Negro Giants Grows
The chances of the sporting relegation of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players to stay in the league have increased.
Because if there was a wildcard system, there would be one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers has waived an application for a possible relegation spot.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure", said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City since 2012.
A first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it was established that Düsseldorf would not receive a license", Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23 May, the rising Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitral tribunal and prove his economic fitness for the Bundesliga.
The Rhine counties have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last resort.
Haigerloch: The Eucharist Church is in the spotlight
As a city contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's cultural and tourism office is dedicating the last of its public thematic tours this year to the Church of the Lord's Supper on Sunday, October 27.
After visiting the Atomic Basement Museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850 is to be considered, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final event is a visit to the Eucharist church.
There, the guides are told the story of the church's construction and gain insight into the development of the evangelical community in a predominantly Catholic area.
The church also features the painting of the Lord's Supper, created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The other half-hour tour will be held at the Atomic Basement Museum at 3 p.m.
There are tickets at the box office of the Nuclear Basement Museum.
The tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available for questions and information.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could be making statements in the US intelligence affair while in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia.
This was reported by Interfax, citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be settled between the Member States.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In that case, he will lose his refugee status", the agency quoted a source as saying.
Because Germany was an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened extradition there, it was further stated
Long breaths pay off
Six men's teams competed for the title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the final match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friends Rohrdorf to the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
Five games were scheduled per team, with each team playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter is leading the tournament
The tournament was run by Anja Schlichter, with the support of Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were tied with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to decide.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stage was won by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphalt Drivers team.
With late afternoon sunshine and coffee and cake, the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest open-air museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
The museum traditionally welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday programme, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events.
"On both days, young and old can learn different ancient crafts", says the press release.
Whether it's making soap, spinning candles, or making felt or rope, it's a must-have for all ages.
The children are assisted by local craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum's workshop is also a work of art.
The young guests can demonstrate their craftsmanship by building cuckoo pipes, water wheels, or spinning wheels.
The many old games, such as sled racing and steeplechase, also promise much fun.
Speed and coordination are needed here.
For all young detectives, the open-air museum offers a guided tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 noon and 2 p.m.
On a curb tour, children must guess which stories are true or false.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be playing his schabernack with the museum guests from 11 a.m. onwards.
It's a fairy tale-like and cosy time at Hermann Büttner's.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30.
On both days of the event, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., many craftsmen, such as the brush-binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker, will be able to watch over their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum are still waiting for a varied holiday programme.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable horse because he has decided to race in America on his 1920-year-old motorcycle.
Burt's heart failure is not gonna stop him from his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old shop sheds, he ships off to Los Angeles.
After the movie, there'll be coffee, tea and cake.
The local people are disturbed by the screaming of the beeps
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They're distributing the coal from the ships to the stall.
The company has several fires at the same location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard is also investing in wind energy logistics.
Black shines on the coal deposit in front of the dam.
Two huge blue storage and reloading machines distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the envelope moves, a loud warning sound is heard across the area.
"The signals are for safety and are required by law", says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in bad weather, this is widely heard - and there have been some complaints from people in the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being lowered by technical measures.
He should continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot of work to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to import coal for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
The 18.5m-deep lounge in front of the terminal has made it possible to load Capesize bulk carriers.
"This year we want to cross the 3 million tonne mark in transhipment", says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon plant on the ground, the imported coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF-Suez power station is connected, it is realistic to import 5 million tonnes of coal a year.
The three ship loading stations on the bridge and the second conveyor belt could provide up to 10 million.
Bavarian basketball players optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the enormous optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can stop us from believing that we can win against the best team in Europe over the past two years", Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) score on Thursday night against defending champions Olympiakos Piräus.
We sent the message: basketball exists in Munich too!
The Munich-based team sold very well in their third appearance in the European King's class, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive stages.
The visitors first managed the feat of turning a 15-point lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus again turned the game around.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again", said Bayern's pro Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich team, who had won clear victories in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten years of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
New York City is arguably the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, the variety performer Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Faye's innovation has expanded, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then got more and more successful until they were too famous to perform in a club", Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we could continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual music and comedy benefit for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
The festival has also grown the world of comedy.
A number of the comedians participating in this year's festival have become known through more unconventional ways, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironically slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest attractions of the festival is an interview with David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show titled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg on TV Land.
The meeting is at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
Iran satisfied with nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process, with the five UN veto powers and Germany a week before the next nuclear meeting.
"After years, we have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years", Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment and the environment.
Tragedy in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machetes
Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two boys, aged 14 and 12, had invited their victim to go bird-hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw his body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
They would then play soccer outside their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the town of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
The alibi was for a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, who they had taken away, to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime to the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the premeditated killing of the 11-year-old.
The older man cited rivalry in a football game as one of the reasons.
He was temporarily committed to a juvenile mental institution.
Pimps need to go to jail
For exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm, the District Court of Konstanz has sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former German soldier, who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan, confessed in a plea bargain.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, whom he dismissed after a few weeks against their will.
He used violence and threats to break up opposition.
He withheld the earnings of the women, some of whom had worked for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he cut off the women's contact with the outside world.
He and a colleague who was a middleman took the women to various brothels in the Southwest.
There he had them partly monitored to control their earnings.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he suffered severe trauma after colleagues were killed in an explosion next to him in Afghanistan.
After a psychiatric expert expressed serious doubts about his mental limitation and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a full confession.
The court did not hear any of the injured women.
According to a Kripo official, after an initial report, telephone surveillance measures were able to identify at least four more cases of exploitative trafficking.
The intercepted conversations were characterized by a high degree of aggression.
In subsequent interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, who had noticed bruises all over one of the women, did not give a statement until today.
It is "a completely broken personality" that regards violence and exploitation as normal in this business.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has broken away from these circles and wants to lead a normal life after his imprisonment", he said.
Oil price continues to fall to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector was growing.
The benchmark crude oil for deliveries in December fell by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in late morning electronic trading in Europe at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which was a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Within five weeks, the supply had risen by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continuing recovery in the Chinese economy, which grew by 7.8% in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel at the ICE exchange in London.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program, dismissing the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended pending a decision on the city's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way it implemented its detention and interrogation program.
The City appealed against its assessment and the remedial measures ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its policy and training programme.
The appeals court heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she had violated the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias, in part on the basis of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by inappropriately targeting black and Latino men with the Stop-and-Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes, including policy reforms, training and oversight, and ordered a pilot programme of body-worn cameras in the neighbourhoods where most inspections were carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
The City of Frankfurt Hahn shall be informed of the decision of the Board of Appeal and of the decision of the Board of Appeal.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights activists.
Such checks have been around in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the tenure of non-partisan Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latino men.
In 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed by four men, all of whom were minorities.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police departments use the system.
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen police morale but not crime; would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs were cut over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but merely reforming the way the NYPD implements controls.
The happiness of the camels in their dreams
Happiness is an oasis only camels dream of reaching
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman Henne gave a detailed report on the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, further cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne performed numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the talks, images of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It's a former federal border patrol vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former Nagold's OB, had proposed that this vehicle be fitted with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to become an advisor to the association.
In 2008, the Bavarian timber company Schleeh built the hospital in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital, in a record time of just under a week - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting at a time when Nagold is trying to rationalize the maternity clinic.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, like slowing down burn-out.
Because of the political unrest in the country, the number of trips could not be as large as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to work in various fields.
Also, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, including medical equipment, medicines, bandages, hospital beds, and glasses in March of this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local colour by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into mobile goat stables and describing the experiences of the local musicians who traditionally support the association during their Mauritania trip.
He cited his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament as his personal motivation.
When he realized how much money was being lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also requires global love of humanity.
It should also be borne in mind that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria, it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify a tip.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair by then Home Secretary Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voicemails and tracked them down, but Coulson called them too and left messages, as the court learned.
"The prosecution believes that Coulson, who is now editor of the NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people's homes and hopes to catch them in the act, but someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction", Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second one, the surveillance, but it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And whether he knew about it".
Rumors of a Clarke affair were first picked up by the feature editorial staff of NotW, when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was secured at Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the detective's computer, which Pawlby and her sister had stored as "projects".
During the time the investigation was going on, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the surveillance of Pawlby's movements.
On 18 June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to release tomorrow that I would like to discuss with Charles".
Edis explained that Coulson's activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have all admitted to hacking into the phone.
In protest against the planned tax on the Reich, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A mediation meeting ends in a draw.
In the conflict over the Reich tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed mediation meeting.
President Hollande welcomed representatives of associations and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and heard their complaints.
But he refused to exempt football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than a million euros a year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side stayed hard, too.
The strike announced for the end of November will now also be carried out, said the head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The dates for Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches between 29 November and 2 December are therefore not available.
Gechingen: No absolute protection is possible
"We want to involve the residents in planning at an early stage", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the town hall to be explained about the planned actions, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häusler made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 was a decisive event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river survey was commissioned from the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many of the built-up areas as possible", Häußler says.
The basis for this is the planning of protection against a flood which, according to the German Meteorological Service, is expected to occur every 100 years.
Climate change is being addressed by a 15% surcharge.
In the field, this is known as "HQ 100aKlima".
The floods that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1,000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", Häußler said.
To achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to count on land subsidies of around 70 per cent.
Heußler pointed out, however, that the funding would only be available if an overall approach was implemented.
The municipality relies on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process has to be completed.
The best case scenario is that implementation could start in 2016.
The protection concept, which was presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) includes local measures in the Irm river's inflow from the Stammheimer valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, questions were raised as to why more dams and reservoirs were not planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner at the designated engineering firm Wald und Corbe in Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it required the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
The Commission is also looking at ways of improving the quality of the services provided by the European Commission.
The people who live near the altar were displeased, as even during normal thunderstorms they have to suffer from overloading of the canal system.
The problem is known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häusler pointed out, however, that the directives for sewerage systems were different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality was obliged to construct the canal network so that it could withstand two to three years of rainfall.
Scaling up the sewers would swallow millions.
Serious injuries after collision
Early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on State Road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately completely blocked the road, but could not say much about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her in his Hyundai.
The two vehicles collided, the woman so trapped that it took the fire department just under half an hour to get her out of the wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both victims were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track was completely blocked for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoyevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker after God, a metaphysician, and his novels and short stories have something of a serial nature as well.
Amazing the kinship on the outside: the prickly eyes, the beard, the tall forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who is quite a figure in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Publishing, which has sold over two thousand copies of the Haffmans tape with the 118 stories.
Dick declares America - the realm of stunning technological progress coupled with paranoia, delusions of security and the belief that it is chosen.
Dick had experiences with God, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs in his brain.
He realized early on that computers are gods.
He wrote a theology of the computer, asking what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is especially significant now.
The Minority Report is from 1956, it smells like the Cold War and the McCarthy trials.
The principle of pre-crime is being developed here, pre-crime, which is now more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is terrifyingly similar to ours, mutants are looking into the future and the police are intervening.
"We arrest individuals who have not broken any laws", says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime".
And, "We don't have any serious criminals in our society, but we have a penitentiary full of money-criminals". They read time flows.
They assume that bad things are happening, and they prevent the criminal idea from being turned into action.
Dick's story is like a blueprint for anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's wiretapping frenzy.
Anticipating the attack: That's how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief laments that there is no longer any division of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system's going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It's inventing its own conditions.
It does not just accept mistakes and sacrifices, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick is about getting closer to the truth.
German Foreign Minister
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could be making statements in the US spy case involving Chancellor Angela Merkel while in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor's office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, Interfax reported.
The European Parliament has also been asked to give its opinion on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to chemical substances.
NSA revelations are fueling corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Fight against Terrorism (BVT), the German domestic intelligence service, he was to photograph the roof of the US Foreign Service, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance tapes and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the US was not using foreign espionage to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or profits.
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-ex-employee, began to release his filler horn on US surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the Director at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have raised corporate paranoia about government surveillance to a new high.
The barrel to spill led to the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly for as long as a decade.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then surely corporate executives are potential targets too.
Snowden made the intense cooperation between US intelligence and corporations transparent.
I think it's conceivable that this data could be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", explains Oliver Grün, President of the BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies now believe the US poses almost as much of a risk as China in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consultancy firm EY.
However, the documents leaked by Snowden did not contain any evidence that the United States had passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"It doesn't work that way", says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything but the IT industry.
Yet the scope and technical sophistication of the US intelligence agencies exposed in the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest risk of espionage in China.
Cloud computing is undergoing a major change, as European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to US jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a commercial institution, after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-US members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: "We're seeing a new question from customers that wasn't there a year ago: Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it stays physically in that jurisdiction?"
Many German business leaders believe that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and must therefore guard them at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally in the current debate", says Kurt Bock, chairman of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, as we are doing, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate leaders do not usually brag about the countermeasures they have taken, because that gives attackers an advantage.
In large companies, employees have long been told that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick to a trade fair or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at carmaker Audi, says that for years it has been standard practice to collect cell phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they travel abroad, because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets from unauthorised access", warns a report by the BVT.
The United States is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the February U.S. National Intelligence Estimate, France, Russia, and Israel ranked second behind China as the countries that used hacking to obtain economic data.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of France's domestic intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.
Hechingen: The fair answers the wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake", said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to get the wedding party going, there was a special mass in the Hechingen domain.
Representatives were important suppliers around a wedding.
One trend: The retro look has taken hold again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White must, best covered or in cream.
The clothes, often scented and embroidered, are closed in front, often with a veil, but in the back they go down the back and often end up in a drawer.
But as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house Drekermüller points out, the spirits are separating.
Men's suits are predominantly vested and plastron, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of venue was important, it was explained.
Unadorned side rooms are not ideal, the ambiance should be special.
This is where the domain called attention to its own offer in the shop.
If you want to go ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer.
"But carriages are also popular for bachelor parties", he says.
Romanticism is also in demand for invitation cards, floral arrangements, and wedding photos.
"After-wedding photography" is becoming more and more fashionable - a series of photographs taken in special locations, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the wedding, but in wedding clothes", explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding tables, cakes and even a magician, like Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for a party you won't forget.
Dog friends are successful
For the second time, the Dog Friends of Bitz have been successful in a Rally Obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Hopper faced the criticism of the judge with her Woody in first grade.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe murder
The parents of the teenager whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gymnasium of his high school are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, U.S.A., was found on January 11 in a raised mat behind the grandstand in the sculpture hall.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Department investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You'd never have believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe it is without logic, violates the laws of physics and common sense", Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"Her son went to school to learn and came back in a body bag", he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore made the announcement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
'I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation', he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died from the effects of "position-related suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed", he said.
Moore added that if there is enough evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative from the county sheriff's office was not immediately available for comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in south Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues as to how he died.
CDC releases allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for handling food allergies in school children.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-aged children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
According to the CDC, the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools stockpile epinephrine  the auto-injection brand EpiPen is most commonly used  to prevent a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators recently changed the rules to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also lists typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say: "It feels like something is pressing against my tongue", "My tongue feels like a hair is on it", or "My tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersex children can choose gender indefinitely
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-unique genitalia.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare the sex of such children, but can indicate "unspecified" or "not specified" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to remove pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions about newborn sex reassignment surgery and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person told the BBC years later: "I am neither man nor woman".
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and scarred.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 babies are born each year as neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, a group of people diagnosed with gender-differentiation disorder (DSD), a term for people with atypical chromosomes, germline (ovaries or testes) or abnormally developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the US advise that one should use the best available information on gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding  if at all  for surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law "sounds like a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
'Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children do not', he said.
You can do a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret of why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-based but is determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor exclusively female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of the two.
These characteristics were found in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and height, primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in their workplace, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match the gender image are now in a special camp.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to identify themselves as male, female or 'third sex' on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) became the world's first 'genderless' person after a court granted her a lifetime 'non-determined' gender status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will now have a third allocation, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition calling for the "gender theory" to be removed from school textbooks.
The US website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, saying: "If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision but sexual activity is not, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization".
The mother of a newborn baby in Maryland told Baby Zone that she would prefer to have a sex for babies at birth.
"Parenting is stressful enough without any other restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your child", she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female sex organs were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine viewed sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now, the ethical basis of surgery is being questioned, given the complexity of gender identity, and the fact that doctors can also be wrong about not knowing how a child feels growing up with the gender they assigned.
"In the mid-20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Drescher said.
When such a child was born, the psychiatrist was not called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory of treating children with vaginal disfigurements dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that the sex was malleable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental stimuli  how parents raise a child  interact with a child's genes and hormones and shape whether a person considers themselves male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as John/Joan, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed in a botched circumcision to castrate the child completely and to remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which it was not, according to Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to male and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher says there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public's attention, not happy with the outcome.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were unsure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he should have a vaginal replacement.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which caused his body to fail to produce enough testosterone to develop genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to his male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he's fighting for others in an organization called the Interface Project to make intersex people feel normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that the German law might encourage "stamping and stigmatizing".
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make hasty decisions and assign the child a 'non-determined' job", she explained.
We fear that this will favour intervention.
We think it's better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know yet what the law will do, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports the Australian law because it allows adults to be recognized as third sex.
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender", she explained.
The German law concerns the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight you should be forcing on young children at this time.
When they're adults, they can decide for themselves what their bodies are.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says that German law "empowers both parents and children".
Katie, Baratz's daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the defect in the receptor of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 years old and married; she works as a staff member in the department of child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents room to make decisions without rushing", said Baratz.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and so gives them time before they write "male" or "female".
That way, everything is fine. You raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of parenthood.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
'This involves the children in the decision and removes the fear that parents have because they think they won't do the right thing', she explained.
In the end, the child decides which sex is best for him or her, and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknowns injure girls by shooting from car
Unknown assailants have shot and wounded a 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had apparently fired an air-pressure weapon at a group of children in Ghent on Thursday evening.
The police in the castle told me.
The girl was slightly injured on the left side of the wrist.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The gunshot came from a van that had passed a group of six children and stopped suddenly.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also fired at a bus stop.
A glass shattered.
Afterward, they drove away.
The Criminal Police are investigating, they said Friday.
By now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against the facades of the house.
Since the homeowners recognized this early and immediately removed the eggs, no damage to property was likely to have occurred.
In addition, some Sylvester bullets were probably detonated in the city area, but no property damage was caused here either.
A resident of Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped in toilet paper and his wheel blinds were stolen.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man had found all his wheel blinds in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to take any further action.
Living with a view to the future
Actually, Waltraud Ries is a wonderful man.
Their house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stand, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes away by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time now.
But you know how hard it is in Stuttgart.
The reason, she explains, is not spider phobia but the fear of not being able to climb the many stairs to the house and the apartment as you get older.
In addition, since having a meniscus operation, the woman in her mid-50's has had to experience firsthand what it means to move from floor to floor with a disability.
Recently, she published a book entitled 'Happily Ever After - What Is the Best Way to Live?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not possible in old age,' she begins.
When she and her husband moved into the Maisonette apartment over 20 years ago, it was just a nice little place in the middle of nowhere.
Today, in his mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are concerned about the subject of 'living in old age'.
Most of them will keep it out as long as they can.
Only the others grow old,' she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'It may be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
'But what kind of home you choose is always a personal decision,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider the possibility of becoming ill.
And 'without a good knowledge of the local language, you can also be lonely in the Dolce Vita,' the author of the book warns those who want to emigrate.
Their models include traditional care models, alternative housing forms or the often cited pensioner WG.
♪ When you get old, you've got your ticks and your gills ♪
'I wouldn't want to live in a housing community like this,' she says with a wink.
Not like a student union with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
'When you get older, you just need your retreats,' says Ries.
The author of the book does not want to rule out the possibility of a senior living community.
But it would have to be different than the traditional student-run school.
And sometimes you just want to be alone,' she believes.
At least she is not alone in this opinion in the capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartments as long as possible', is the experience of Theresa Rütten, head of the citizens' service for the elderly in the state capital.
Your office advises people on the subject of 'getting older'.
This is why especially older people would often accept inconveniences and limitations just to stay in their familiar surroundings, as the experience of the Warentest Foundation shows.
Today, there are many ways to make your home or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone who is considering age-appropriate renovations to his or her home or apartment first do a thorough research and not hire the best craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate remodeling.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is just the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But even if the existing apartment is beautiful, it is not always possible to remodel it in a way that is age-appropriate and thus accessible.
This was the experience of Waltraud Ries.
Although a stair lift could be installed inside the apartment, the stairs would also be the biggest obstacle to the door.
She will keep searching until she finds the perfect object for herself and her husband.
She's more scared of moving than the spider on her doorstep.
US wants to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its position on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of having passed on unauthorized classified information.
He must therefore face criminal prosecution in the United States, said U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even recent statements by Snowden would not change that.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele, after meeting Snowden in Moscow, appealed to the US not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbele's statements were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a member of the German government.
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities.
But first he wants to know his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the US in an unaddressed letter that Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General.
The letter, in a translation circulated by Ströbele, reads:
To the competent authorities
I've been asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden, and I used to be employed on a contract or through a direct employment as a technical expert with the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which prompted me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I found myself exposed to serious and persistent harassment, which forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-out surveillance that owes no accountability as a public service.
These spying revelations prompted many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society of these findings are becoming increasingly clear, while the risks taken into account have been visibly reduced.
Although the results of my efforts have been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Still, telling the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this conciliatory stance.
I hope that once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been overcome I will be able to take an appropriate and lawful part in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular as regards the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden is witnessed by Hans-Christian Ströbele
The kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Michael Maier, mayor of Winterlingen.
The former kindergarten in Garden Street has been sold by the municipality to a private individual.
The sale was approved by the city council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed ownership at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied", Maier stresses.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and cleaning the sidewalk.
"That has gone away", Maier rejoices.
A concert in the heat of summer
The Hammereisenbach Music Club is giving a concert on the terrace of the Hammer Inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners are delighted by the sounds of the Hammerich musicians.
The chairman, Manuela Honeck, will explain the music.
Honeck thanked all those who had helped to overcome the first musician's hook successfully.
Report: Obama campaign is considering replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls" in late 2011 to determine whether Obama's waning re-election hopes would be better off if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national political correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by senior campaign and White House officials, most notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice president on polling results.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the proposed switch.
In "Double Down", it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to replace Biden despite their tight personal relationship before finally deciding against such a move after data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said a whole bunch of things that should be considered, and that was one of them", Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible polling figures back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we going to do?"
While Daley called the investigation "due care", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been put into the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot box.
"In campaigns, you don't spend so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don't think about something seriously", Martin told AC360.
It's not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president was aware of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "Double Down" does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Perhaps", said Martin.
What happens to my e-mail on the way?
E-mail is actually electronic mail.
Was the design of the Internet service e-mail similar to the traditional mail, the technical secrecy of the mail was implemented?
The primary focus of the early Internet services was to enable communication.
The basic technical protocols have therefore failed to provide a stable basis for secure correspondence.
So a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The first step is for Anna's e-mail program or browser to send the e-mail to the e-mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can run through several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can call his ISP to get the content.
Are traditional e-mails read on their way through the web?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider will usually check whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the receiver systems.
Providers also check whether it is a harassing and unwanted spam, which is deleted immediately or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems like Gmail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place contextual ads.
When Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming vacation, Google can display links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people read the e-mails?
The likelihood of an unauthorized person reading an email is extremely low.
But theoretically, it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means to intercept or take note of e-mails.
And then there's the potential for illegal surveillance.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
OpenPGP standard encryption can effectively encrypt an e-mail against co-readers.
It is also possible, with considerable technical effort, to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication so that it is not even possible to easily identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the German e-mail market?
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet assessed the compatibility of the measure with the internal market.
While Yahoo's shares of Mail had recently fallen, Google's Gmail had gained significantly.
Mother buried in the woods and collected a pension
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg devised a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and nursing money.
In order to continue to collect pension and childcare, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he's been withholding the money for over a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old must answer for fraud, a spokesman said Friday.
According to the police, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May, when it was noticed that the mother no longer needed medication.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officers found this strange, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had been living in the same apartment for over 15 years and he had last taken care of them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted his mother's death.
Police said an autopsy showed no evidence of a capital crime.
You want ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glowing ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the sea creatures to create a glowing treat.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convincing Chinese scientists to synthesize the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eaten, raising the pH of the protein and causing it to glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in your mouth and lights up - so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but it's still in its very early stages of production, so you can get two grams of it for 200 pounds".
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats up the protein, the pH goes up and the ice glows.
We've been testing it for the last few months, and we thought it would be ideal to release it on Halloween, because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and leafy gold.
But his latest creation is said to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream".
That is impossible in itself because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we will find a way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, which Chinese scientists have artificially made
The TSV Morsum are still without a point in the Handball Federation League after six days of play.
The team of Ingo Ehlers will now compete tomorrow in the derby against TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first victory last weekend.
This game is the start of the season for us.
"I hope we finally have a clear head", Ehler says optimistically.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden is playing the tempo, just like us.
So we have to keep our error rate low.
The first thing to do is to increase coverage, which has not been as safe as it seems.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number, of course.
But that's not why we're the favourites, because anything can happen in the derby.
Panitz is now planning to set up shop in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing.
For this, the A-young Joost Winduss, who is active with double-play right at the A-young Bundesliga HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, you should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had a magic touch.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more like a Halloween muffin.
I have not agreed to hand out sweets from my apartment for the past two years, and I am not likely to do so this year.
But statistically, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million, to be exact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the latest in the line.
Women no longer have to dress in sexy clothes, but can now embody tempting foods like pizza, hamburgers, or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft-punk spacemen will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year, and to my surprise, we weren't alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
We're not exactly the candy-crazy type.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million pounds of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, walk around the neighborhood saying "sweet or sour".
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween and we're not going to do anything before we eat.
The only thing we don't want to eat is the sugary candy corn, yet 15 million pounds of it are sold on Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectioners.
That's about nine billion corn kernels.
It's a riddle I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more Halloween than haunted houses.
They have great names like Terror Behind the Walls, Howl-O-Scream, and The House of Shock.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, making $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos of you peeing in your pants and then posting your friends on Facebook where you can't get rid of them again, and then the guy you're standing next to leaves a comment like "sweet face".
But let's get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree  something we've done since we were little.
Fortunately, the pumpkin baby trend didn't start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving pumpkins, not sitting on them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin torch, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, is thought to have come from Illinois, where this year, more than 100 million pounds of pumpkins were harvested.
If you want to score, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and carve something pretty out of their 3,000-pound pumpkin.
Fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers find charred body
The fire department had to leave late Thursday night in helmet-rights.
A three-family house in County Court caught fire on Friday night.
Rescuers are pulling a charred body from the house.
Rescue crews found a charred body in a three-family home in Helmbrechts during a fire.
It is not clear whether the victim is a resident, a police spokesman in Bayreuth said.
Late Thursday night, there was a fire on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already burning out of a window.
The emergency services went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned to the ground.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not home at the time of the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is uninhabitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest parish church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor's profession.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hannover expects the number of its current 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 from the current situation.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the local church has for the first time commissioned a full-time pastor to encourage young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-churching: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The Commission is also aware of the need to improve the quality of the services provided by the various services.
I am the master of my schedule and can focus on where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as spiritual shepherds.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well on it.
I'm sure the free market pays more, but theologians would have a secure employer.
This is in line with the wishes of today's young people, who are not only interested in a career but also in meaningful work.
According to the state church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theological school begin their vicarage.
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to fill jobs in the future.
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The study of theology offers a broad education.
You can even become president.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior features racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as a free-speaker system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.
They're not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure and an accessible route to world-class events.
We are delighted to be opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car. It's going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge includes a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a puppy trapped 50 feet (15 m) above the ground on a dangerous ledge in a quarry
Cocker spaniel dog Ruby ran away after a minor car accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a stranger in the quarry in her awkward condition.
Firefighters rode off the cliff and saved the dog from certain death
The firefighters managed to rescue a puppy that was trapped on a 50-foot-high ledge in a rock wall.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel dog Ruby ran away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to welcome Ruby back and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their missing dog, posting calls for help on social media when she ran into the quarry after the minor car accident.
About 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a stranger walking his dog saw Ruby stranded on the 50-foot foot of the quarry.
The technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and sailed to rescue Ruby, who was then transported upstairs in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, technical specialist for the rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was in the middle of the rock wall, 50 feet [15 m] above the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue. She was frozen to death.
But she's fine now.
She ate some dog cakes afterwards.
That was a pretty unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, technical specialist for the rescue team, said: "Ruby had a terrible accident".
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for an examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary".
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and she had collapsed, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters have done a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful and each and every one of them has been absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up".
The fire department was great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never fucked Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she was a backing singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the drunk, and that he beat me up when I was 18.
She added: "It was a long time ago and he was very nice to me".
In a statement, a spokesman for Jagger, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denies" that he ever made any attempt to approach Katy Perry.
The representative added: "Maybe she got him confused with someone else".
Perry was one of the female singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album, Prism, went straight to number one this week.
George Kerevan: European unity gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
That's the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde template pointed to the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but this did not make headlines  as expected .
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States often bend their strict rules when it is more convenient for them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in return for what is really wanted from the Scots.
So not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already looks like a fossil: I first heard the "independence means passport control" ending at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance to the European whistle?
Why trade the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
This is the real news in Europe: the great plan for European unification, conceived after the war, has been put on hold.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro as the common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year, won almost five million votes in the September parliamentary elections, effectively expelling the Free Democrats (the British equivalent of the Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is proving to be a turning point.
The strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket imposed on the national economies by the adherence to the single currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits  this was the case only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are favourable to German exporters  and German politicians would like to keep it that way.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe is left with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared with Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public expenditure, with the encouragement of Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are the result of a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the 'green energy' directives enacted by Brussels, a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry is paying twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we saw in Grangemouth.
All the wage-setting systems in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is rising, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to bring Paris to the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, which is a problem for the battered French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes  a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among white working-class French?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections, and this is very possible, then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to make: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will converge on the abolition of the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be standing alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stand in all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final analysis) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes telling Berlin and Brussels where to go.
I think Scotland could do very well in a looser European Union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise we should consider doing the same as Norway and retaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is  remarkably  the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, winning a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts, which were blamed on Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to be forced into a policy of austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, studies show.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter starts to grow breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz said that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents", said Kaplowitz, "which is not usually a sign that puberty is fast approaching".
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and arm hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the occurrence of the first menstrual period) over the past 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to menarche", said Kaplowitz, who also authored the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Managing This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the onset of puberty, but it is 'premature' when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates, which a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is made more rapidly, tests by an endochronologist may be indicated to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to stunting and thus to short growth in adults.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reserved about medication, but admits: Repressing puberty can ease behavioural problems and girls' feelings of being different from their peers.
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side", Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock", recalls a woman whose daughter had her first birthday at the age of ten.
Even though there were early signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home from school scared and excited because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys, like girls, come into puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported the conduct of a 2001 study on girls aged six to nine, which established a link between body fat and the onset of puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and young children.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having to have a conversation sooner than expected", Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who bloom early need reassurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs sooner than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in the face of large orders
A dispute has arisen between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at this month's Dubai Airshow.
The controversy is over the width of seats offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class  not always the ones airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims made on the latest aircraft by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week demanded an industry standard requiring a minimum seat width of 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. rival Boeing says that's for airlines to decide.
The dispute comes as aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The rear design of the aircraft  in particular whether there are nine or ten-seat rows  is crucial to the reported economic results that the new Mini-Jumbo design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims that its upgraded 777X can hold 406 passengers in tourist-class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18-inch-wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often advertise technical details in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing to the public directly ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company launched an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people squashed together in a restaurant, with the headline: Would you accept this?
Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops, says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
Changes in diet have made people fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st century is 100.8 centimeters, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is following a 1950s seat concept, when the average body circumference of the newly christened "jet set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an extra inch (2.54 cm) per seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputes Airbus' figures on seat sizes and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance between fares and facilities.
The company also explains that research shows that the experience of flying depends on more than the width of the seat.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to do to succeed", explains Boeing cabin specialist Kent Craver.
They don't want us dictating what makes it profitable.
You know your business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow room, but for manufacturers it is increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
The debate is about a race for aircraft orders estimated to be worth at least US$700 billion at list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the US or European export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat on their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on comparing the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increase in unit costs is still lower than for the ten-seat machines currently in use.
"Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products", says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers were opting for the narrower layout, which could come with cheaper flight fares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat posed by the 777", says Mary Kirby, cabin expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
World-traveling jet sellers even carry band-measures to measure the equipment against the competition.
Even though they boast of comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-compression layouts for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 series, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the importance of increased cabin adaptability and offered wide aisle seating for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to be dampened, but could divert attention from the 777X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put an end to the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More trials are needed before human trials, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results are good.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, and tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to find that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches", Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for producing nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In experiments, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Unvaccinated mice, on the other hand, took a "break", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so frequently to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, for it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is safe, could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, though, is that smokers would use it to quit.
"You know that if you start smoking again, the nicotine injection will make you feel less pleasure, and that will help you quit", he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denied that he was influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the state's corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies changing the maritime lease regulations at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had covert holdings in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced several ministers to renew leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without a tender after they expired in August 2005.
Now, the investigation is underway into the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the property after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases of the companies on Circular Quay, which brought Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, had initially advocated public tenders.
However, he denied that he made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had been pushing for a reorganisation of the government's lease arrangements.
A telephone transcript submitted to ICAC showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working for Obeid in the Fisheries Authority, in August and September 2007.
'Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements?' asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No", said Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't that.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes strike target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has already carried out at least two airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visas could be subjected to 'authenticity tests'
The government is considering a 'authenticity test' for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of broader measures.
If the test were introduced, it would be based on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a backdoor for family and friends to move to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was published today after former Labor MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers as offensive to Australia's neighbours.
"Loud statements like 'foreigners should line up at the back' and 'Australians should hire first' are a very unpleasant fallback in times when unions were demanding a protected labour market", she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected, and if some in the region were to belittle an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was yesterday in talks on human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the 'authenticity criterion' is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked for the authenticity of the application in cases where the applicant is related to or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company.
Companies could also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support a small number of workers ended up hiring hundreds in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father died on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as 2026, starting with phase 1.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring Britain closer together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of phase two, connections will be made to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed railway between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look into further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: Our aim for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together.
We're moving forward with HS2 because it's going to be tremendously beneficial.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmichael, commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to 'unequivocally' support the integration of Scotland into the HS2 network.
Brown said: 'The high-speed rail link has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic strength also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK.'
That is why we are delighted to be working with the UK Government to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will create benefits for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to discussing the report with the British ministers next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Regulations on electronic equipment on board aircraft remain in force provisionally in Australia
Australian air passengers continue to have to turn off tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to ease regulations for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their regulations so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
Passengers are allowed to do this during most of the flight, but many people are upset that they are not allowed to read their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian companies are watching the decision, which will require a lot of work by US airlines, but they have no immediate plans to change their regulations.
The CASA also stated that it would look into the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases in Australia remained in place.
CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on board aircraft, it was announced.
The subject is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already been in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and says it is open to changes but would need to be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, as we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience as we now offer (wireless entertainment) in-flight", a spokesperson said.
Qantas stated that it would remain with the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines state that no electronic devices may be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no current plans to change this", the company explained.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in arrangements that passengers can benefit from and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision will have different effects on US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and customer instruction.
"Once an airline has confirmed its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any altitude", the FAA announced.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the derby against Schalke, BVB supporters had been travelling with light rackets for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences.
Before Friday's game of the football league against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic, which offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
The audience was mostly the guest fans with their songs.
The southern stands, where the most loyal and loudest BVB fans are, were initially exceptionally quiet: no singing, no shouting.
The Capo's podium, which normally coordinates the joint cheering, was left unoccupied.
And in front of the grandstand, a large banner with the words "Section No Stadium" was waving lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller entered the field as the first BVB player, as always, did a brief jubilation flare up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand, nothing moved.
Norbert Dickel, the stadium's spokesman, once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - but it did not create a mood of celebration.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the capo climbed his podium - and the tension that had been almost palpable by then was released in a loud cry as Dick, as usual, questioned the mood in the stadium.
Last, as always, was the south stands - and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And by the time the loud call "Derby winner stands up" came from the south stand, everything was back to normal.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired flares into the stands and onto the pitch - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was kicked off late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top players of the Dortmund Ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans' representatives.
"There will be massive cuts to the entire ultra movement", the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid that", he explained.
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
The ultra-rights group has also been shown various ways to punish the perpetrators, and they now have until Tuesday to decide which one to choose.
If not, Watzke said, the BVB would impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This will be cutting edge", Watzke assured.
We can't wait to see how the South stands react.
Mortgage houses boom in Singapore as the crisis hits the middle class
At a pawnshop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it", Amirthalinga says.
Although she earns $3,000 (Singapore) a month as an administrative assistant and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is rising  is so high that ValueMax, where it made its swap, this week became the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore Exchange.
Mortgaging jewellery is not only a quick way to get money  1,300 Singapore dollars in Janani Amirthalinga's case , but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent demanded by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of income, which makes loans quicker than banks.
As a result, millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies, families with lower and middle incomes are looking to mortgage houses to make up the difference in a stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's identified rising household debt, mainly from rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest levels of government debt in Asia as a proportion of gross domestic product, according to the Agency.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weak exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"Ultimately, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower income bracket will try to supplement their income wherever possible", says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further fueled the trend towards mortgaging personal items as people take the opportunity to convert family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold.
People are saying, "The gold price looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month".
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates the branch in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, is looking to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia, where the company operates four homes, but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, managing director of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the $66 million it raised this week in Singapore.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and liquidating personal valuables does not increase household waste", she explains.
The pledge business is increasingly accepted in society as short-term, secure financing.
Nor are all mortgage borrowers in financial difficulty.
Rich Singaporeans also come to ValueMax branches to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have clients from all walks of life.
"This includes wealthy people who borrow for a business or investment on a short-term basis, or small businesses that are struggling to cope with cash flow constraints", says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money real quick.
NSA is sucking data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden has a vested interest in helping Germany solve the ever-growing NSA espionage case.
According to the representation of the Green parliamentarian Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officers would testify before a German prosecutor or an investigative committee.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine Panorama.
A $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions attached to the Australian $325 million bailout package for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the state government cannot waste the money.
The Federal Minister for Health, Tanya Plibersek, has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by the island nation's ageing population, higher rates of chronic disease and systemic limitations.
The funding for a four-year period was decided after consultation with the Government and independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state", Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for election benefits.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic procedures and treatments for gray matter, are to be performed to remove residues.
In addition, there is money for day-care centres in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-inpatient care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of an electronic health record system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that I have been told by the clinical staff concerned that they are the best way to improve Tasmanian healthcare", said Tanya Plibersek.
The Minister insisted on a strict accountability of the Tasmanian Government.
The Federal Government would have to maintain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent.
A three-member commission is set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would do little good if it were not accompanied by real reforms to put Tasmania's public health system on a more sustainable course.
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the public health system of the federal state from the list of concerns", said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these election benefits will largely offset the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman for the federal opposition, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is just a "patchwork solution".
"We are in the situation we are in today because the Labor government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system", he told ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government is taking almost half a billion dollars out of the system and putting 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretending that's good news.
Dutton demanded that Plibersek guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel is impressive with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more expensive than necessary.
Set in 1760s France, the story tells the moving story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent by her family to a convent.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another's erotic fascination.
The film never slips into lust or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a torturous penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing capability, according to a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons and poison gas munitions manufacturing facilities, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, as heavy clashes broke out in the north of the country near one of the suspected sites of storing toxic substances.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline of
The European Union has a duty to ensure that the European Union is not forced to accept the threat of nuclear weapons, and that it is not forced to accept the threat of nuclear weapons.
The completion of this process, which is essentially the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
The Commission has not yet decided on the future of the European Union.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting broke out in the town of Safira on Thursday, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production facility and stockpiles, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government said 29,954 of them were members of President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the death toll in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting highlights the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors, whose mission to rid Syria of its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the major production and blending/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.
Therefore, no further inspection activities are currently planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks, visiting 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
The inspectors said that due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities.
On Thursday, the OPWC said that the two sites had been "abandoned" according to Syrian statements... and the chemical weapons program facilities there had been transferred to other named facilities which were inspected.
It was not immediately clear whether the site at Safira was one of two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization", said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, in a comment published by the OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a civil war against the Assad government and its security forces, many of whom are Alawites, a splinter group of Shiite Islam.
In terms of further developments, the head of the monitoring group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he explained.
Anger over the verdict for Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last instigator who was put on trial, as they believe Umar Patek should be executed in the line of duty.
Patek, who spent nearly a decade as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted fugitives, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in building the explosives for the bombing.
With a suspended sentence, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
He was also convicted on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even though it could have sought the death penalty for the man, who is also known as "Demolition Man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has brought back painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation inflicted by Patek and his coconspirators nearly a decade ago.
She said, weeping, that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put in front of a firing squad", Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with the fact that I'm not going to have any more grandchildren and I'm never going to see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002, when a huge bomb exploded in a pickup truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had detonated a rucksack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and died three times while hanging from a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah  Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra  who were responsible for the bloodshed and were executed four years ago.
Seriously, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
No, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden with the goal of reestablishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in", said Corteen.
Until recently, he showed no remorse for the suffering he caused others.
The verdict came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by commemorative events in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year", said Corteen.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but not make cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing games, listening to music, and watching movies from takeoff to landing, but not using their cell phones, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they are implemented depends on the airline, FAA official Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and the equipment storage arrangements to comply with the new regulations.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
You can't start them again until the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing area, passengers must turn it off and not take off again until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices during takeoff, landing and on the runway, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Association of Airline Stewards, welcomed the changes.
"If the new regime is implemented safely, and we work closely with the airline on this, both sides will benefit", Glading commented.
We are frankly tired of having to feel like guardians of this issue.
However, internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, texting or downloading data within three kilometres remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was publicly forced to leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to turn the device off while the plane was parked on the runway.
And heavier equipment like laptops still have to be stowed, because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, the national transportation safety expert, told CBS News that cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Phones are really a problem, not just because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmitting masts", Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month recommended that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics, including Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri, argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies have shown that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communication devices by passenger-operated FM radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time, became known.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to be free of electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years now when they reach flight altitude.
Airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you flip the page.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are higher.
Amazon.com is among the proponents of easing restrictions on passenger use of devices.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not find any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the interference from the devices was real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said that there were only isolated reports from pilots who spoke of aircraft systems being disrupted by the equipment, and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the passengers to turn off instruments during instrument landings in poor visibility.
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them a sensible adjustment for travellers who would be heavily equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue from North Sea island
An airborne bird found exhausted on a North Sea island has been released back into the wild.
The water raccoon was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was pumped up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA to their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water raccoon was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea".
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: "He was unable to continue flying, so we were contacted with a request for help".
When she was released, the water raccoon was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the table and defining what those who create wealth and jobs in Britain want to change about our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them what they thought of the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business leaders, roughly representing the UK's business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe, concentrating on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the countries in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than delaying the long and arduous process of reforming the shadowy EU institutions.
When asked what they think about certain legal issues  from antitrust to product legislation , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies said the costs of Brussels rules now outweighed the benefits of being part of Europe's trading area. Even 40 percent of large companies agreed with the most traditionally European-friendly rules.
Finally, and this is probably the most telling, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority wanted the UK to take a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a 'meaningful change' that brings the reins of the business back to the UK.
It is about a lot  a change in the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum with 16%.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the UK's conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey results show, which means a greater focus on trade for businesses and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls the Bulgarian pipeline the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
"Today is a milestone: construction work has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom's CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the whole European continent.
South Stream is designed to increase the diversity of Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterparts, where the bulk of Russian gas for Europe is stored, is creating an increased risk on conventional routes, according to official reports.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" off.
Bulgaria will receive South Stream gas at discounted rates when the entire project is operational in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries on the planned route is scheduled to start at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location of Germany.
The economic data are correct and the financing possibilities are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th Real Estate Day of the Stock Exchange newspaper.
The German housing markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa at Jones Lang LaSalle, at the 9th Stock Exchange Real Estate Day.
The volume of transactions shows how much German commercial real estate is sought, according to Ulbrich.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared with the same period last year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive rate of return", said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.

Royal Commission hearing: Two YMCA staff charged with sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sex offences before charges were brought against Caringbah childcare worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse learned.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse within the organisation.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a sports instructor at Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of abusing children in his care.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case but didn't know about the second.
He admitted that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in its claim that 'there were external audits of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety'.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second lowest rating out of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that management failed "from me on down" in hiring Lord and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sexual assault on 12 boys during his two-year stint with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lords' violations of child safety.
The staff testified that they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, babysitting them privately, having them sit on his lap, telling one of them he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had requested child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that the child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervisor at the Caringbah YMCA Lords, was 'very intimidating and very unfriendly most of the time'.
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report back to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they hadn't reported him.
Hare stated that he had communicated to the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organisation should learn from the Jonathan Lord incident was not about reporting by employees and the board agreed with him.
Hare said the decision to push employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations emerged was made by the YMCA's director of child services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, which had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, a child sexual abuse expert at Griffith University, told the Commission that the YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organisation when Jonathan Lord worked there between 2009 and 2011.
He explained that there had been serious problems with the recruitment, verification, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until 20 December.
Tony Blair has said he will take the chance to return as British Prime Minister, but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy to the Middle East Peacebuilding Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of Prime Minister, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that will happen, so ..."
When the show jumping experts found themselves in crowds in Cardiff to crown the horse of the year, they knew there was a fierce competition ahead.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who are not even in kindergarten and have only taken their first steps a few months ago, and their Shetland Pony Toffee have been through the three rounds and won the first prize, beating 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable pair, both of equal height, have been praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plate cap at a naughty angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in handling the pony, which are far beyond his years.
And Toffee got top marks for his looks and personality.
Fenton had received toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team".
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and left the field with a gold cup and a rosette.
It was only the second time he had entered a competition with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howell, who has been showing horses for over a decade.
Howells said: "The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered and applauded him".
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did a fantastic job.
Fenton is a beast lover. He loves horses, tractors, farms, and has two chickens to take care of.
The way he's started, it won't be long before he's on the Horse of the Year show and I'm sure he'll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony".
Together, they make a great team.
The judges rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they performed and how well they performed in the preview ring.
They made sure that Pony and Fuhrer worked well together, and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute outfit did her part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" on appeal
A Chinese newspaper that had made a front page call for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a state-owned company.
The regulatory authority explained that the Neue Express is now undergoing a "comprehensive revision".
The 'Correction Order' was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
The Commission also concluded that the Chinese exporting producers were not in a position to provide any information on the export performance of the Chinese exporting producers.
"The editorial management of the Neue Express was disorderly", the regulator said in a statement.
She said it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and to withdraw his reporter's license.
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a complete rectifying of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant persons responsible for the New Express and to immediately review the management team of the New Express.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, reporting on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, the paper published two calls for his release on the front page and supported his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public's trust", he told state-run CCTV news channel.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and fame.
I realized I was wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published a front-page apology, stating that it had failed to properly verify the reports.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law earlier this year that banned authorities from forcing anyone to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico, complete with lighting, ventilation, and electric railway operation, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most elaborate passages they had ever found.
The zig-zag-shaped tunnel, which runs the length of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide truckloads of drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, authorities said.
The tunnel's discovery included eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who the authorities say were working as drivers, were charged with possession and intent to sell marijuana and cocaine.
If convicted, they face sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses a challenge to the drug cartels in getting their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 2,000-foot-long (640-meter) railway passageway that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still in love
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are going their separate ways.
However, in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out about his split from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, scheduled to air Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Sometimes life doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
According to the Lexicon, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it differs from it in a very significant way.
Because while vegetarians may indulge in the consumption of creamy cakes, ice cream, or a strong Edamer, these vices are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, eggs, besides the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan abstains from all animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer inspection the world of vegan nutrition is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity.
"Bread-and-butter recipes are very popular", explains Ute Henkelmann, owner of the local reform home, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop on the Cathedral Avenue.
For 13 years, the native of New Zealand has been vegan, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs for life. "In 1997, I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
And then, around the turn of the century, I took the next step, and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not just from the diet, but from the choice of shoes", says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to regular leather.
He realized that other everyday matters could also be done without animal products.
First of all, being vegan is an ethic.
"I don't want animals to die for me", Proctor says, echoing the vegan maxim that extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning after burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, and the enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus", Proctor says today, "being vegan is not really a renunciation, it's not an asceticism, it's an enrichment". The assumption that changing your diet reduces your choice of food, Proctor attributes more to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditions that caused some well-intentioned attempts to fail.
"The addiction factor is a very important factor that makes many people quit quickly, much like smoking", Proctor compares.
And say, "Some flavors are not to be found in animals".
Often, the spices or the way they are prepared are what determine the taste.
"But there are other ways to produce the same effect", the vegan explains.
Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms, and even some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He takes care to eat a balanced, varied diet, which is sure to be tasty.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but that's not just down to animal food", says Proctor.
Health damage to eating disorders, another common assumption, was not suffered.
I thought the change was a good thing.
I'm not taking in any foreign cholesterol, and I have an elevated vitamin intake.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I get checked often", Proctor reveals.
Many critics of veganism warn against the lack of vitamin B12 in particular.
"Because animals are fed feed instead of grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy from the refrigerator is high in vitamin B12", says Proctor.
Vegans can also take the coenzyme in tablet form.
"My B12 levels are fine", he explains.
Proctor doesn't have to go far to get food.
After all, basic food is everywhere, and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I can get everything I need from the local.
I only buy something special once in a while.
"Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive, but this is also the case with 'ordinary' finished products".
Nevertheless, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than is generally believed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, and with a few tricks you can get some good, if not some better results", says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonated instead of eggs, Proctor's vegan cheesecake surprised even his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new flavor.
It's got a dynamic, and when you cook together, it's got a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as varied as the people themselves", says Proctor.
Of course, there was some scepticism about it.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Am I supposed to feel bad now because I drink milk?" - you have to act like a vegan with a sense of touch when faced with questions like this.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society", Proctor doesn't want to live in an enclave.
And when you look more closely, the everyday world doesn't seem as alien to vegans as you might think - and vegans aren't as limited in their everyday lives as you might think.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many shops offer falafel or vegetarian yufka", says Proctor.
In a pizza place, he avoids pasta dishes, or he orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to adapt.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, it was much more difficult", the New Zealander can identify a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it".
"If enough people come in, they may be inclined to fill the menu", he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Kombuches in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, there are vegan dishes for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they're the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others", says Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a surefire way to make the vast majority impossible in the first place", says Proctor.
However, it can be a bit difficult to buy vegan products at first.
The Commission has also made a number of proposals for the introduction of a new type of food aid, which is to be used to finance the production of foodstuffs for the benefit of the environment.
Not only that, but Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book entitled "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" which explains the many ingredients used in food and cleaning products.
"Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stop or stumble", says Proctor.
Veganism is an important moral point that strikes at the consciousness.
He may not be able to get you to give up your habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
The Nasdaq OMX operator keeps its customers breathless.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German time.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two on the Nasdaq OMX, continued trading unimpeded.
The latest incident continues a series of minor and major failures at the stock exchange operator.
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour because of a data transmission error.
In August of this year, there had been two failures in one week alone.
First, the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent out a massive number of erroneous buy orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
The stock exchange operators then spent almost a whole day looking through the orders and deleting them.
Two days later, half of all U.S. stock trading stalled for several hours because of a computer failure at the Nasdaq.
Last year, the IPO of Facebook also caused a stir.
The Nasdaq systems had failed to keep up with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later found, and it sunk the company to a record $10 million fine.
Constance: Cyclist runs over 63-year-old
The accident occurred, according to police, when a 26-year-old man was driving a women's bicycle on the left sidewalk from the station square to the marketplace on Thursday evening at around 10 p.m.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped off a local sidewalk, the cyclist could not stop in time, police said.
In the ensuing collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the wall of the house, and in the ensuing process, he fell to the ground and suffered a head wound that was about six inches (15 cm) long.
An ambulance team took the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police issue Assange an extradition warrant
British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been given a "summons to report" to appear at a police station, adding that he was threatened with arrest if he did not comply.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on a sex crime charge after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and had asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has issued a request for a 40-year-old man to report to a police station at a time of our choosing, a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his bail.
The embassy has not commented on the delivery of the police subpoena.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible espionage charges there after publishing over 250,000 diplomatic cables on the whistleblower website WikiLeaks.
Driver who was driving at 210 km/h and had hot drinks between his legs is fined £1,000.
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and having a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on the A120 near Braintree on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
At Colchester County Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
He was given seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a stamp duty of 7% on apartments costing over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a business and not as individuals.
The revenue from the stamp duty on residential property in the counties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: 'After the stamp duty increases on expensive homes and the introduction of anti-circumvention legislation, it is hard to argue that high-quality properties are undertaxed, despite the effects of the outdated municipal tax system.'
"However, this move could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy property in London or discourage owners from selling", he added.
First-class properties  the top five to ten per cent of the housing market by price  in London's affluent South West Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have risen by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
Prices in Central London showed a steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging 'domestic market', with the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city experiencing an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Scientists have shed more light on the relationship between a dog's tail wagging and its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs waved their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), whereas nervous dogs waved their tails to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can sense and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "It is well known that in humans, the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that elicit positive or negative emotions".
Here we've tried to look at this in other species.
He also noticed that in dogs, just as in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left hemisphere and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral wagging of their fellow species, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadrupeds and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction and the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs either in a natural version or in a silhouette to eliminate other distracting aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right".
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the waving dog's perspective), they were completely relaxed.
But if the tail was predominantly to the left (again from the dog's perspective, which is waving), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, these movements are not intended to communicate with each other.
Rather, he believes that the dogs would have learned by experience which movements they should be concerned about and which not.
He said: "If you have various encounters with other dogs and wagging your tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences".
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their pets' emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour and visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Medicine, said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right are important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog, and to the right when they see a happy dog.
Another study at the University of Victoria in Canada found that "dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail is waving to the left rather than the right, rather than becoming restless".
He said that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
"While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain hemispheres are used for different purposes, many of the details have yet to be determined", and dogs are no exception, Bradshaw said.
But since its behavior is easy to record, it probably won't take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow due to Alex Turner 's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer contracted strep throat.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert has now been postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had to postpone a previous gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement posted on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and following medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys will also be cancelling the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday 1 November".
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with strep throat, which is why he is unfortunately unable to perform".
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on 20 November, which has been moved to 21 November at the Hydro in Glasgow.
All tickets are valid for these shows.
We apologize to all ticket holders for the inconvenience this may have caused.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will name the first new cardinals of the Catholic Church on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately help in choosing his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 cannot participate in the papal election  this belongs to a group of 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony of appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the consistory.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals eligible to vote is likely to have declined by February.
He explained that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinals eligible to vote back to 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wished.
The consensus next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a certain overlap on the part of Europe, and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance", he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He explained that it was "quite possible" that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been in this situation before. This is all new.
Valero said that typically bishops from large places are called to cardinals, but Francis is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's appointing.
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. for seatback repairs
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manual seat, according to a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Agency on Friday.
Some cars may have a defect in the mechanism for the rearward positioning of the front seat.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal directives on vehicle safety for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is approached from behind, the headrest may not protect the occupants properly, thereby increasing the risk of injury", the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website reported.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
Deliveries of the GM trucks began in June and represent the most important model launch for the leading US automaker since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, rose 20 percent in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The cry of despair of an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice, hoping that change was possible.
He says Obama has made a commendable effort that has been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics
The blockade policy doesn't excuse the Obamacare website problems, the drone attacks
Obama's memoirs of the 2008 election are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up during my bleak second year of medical school and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient notes at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take the breath away from a speech.
The election was a landslide victory and news reporters paused to highlight the historic significance of this hour.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on its way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had 82 percent approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you were being torn from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic times. They seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first voted, something has actually changed.
But it's just not something I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and multifaceted things that Obama has accomplished, from passing the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the withdrawal of the military from Iraq to ending the forced silence on homosexuality in the military and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the partisan tactic of blockade has overturned too many of the efforts that our nation should have made to move forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to the end of my explanatory efforts.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The Republican policy of blockade cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It can't explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished for exposing government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a US citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why the limits on public funding and spending are being circumvented during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the findings of a report that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the most "aggressive" since the Nixon administration.
And finally, it doesn't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
I wonder if I should have understood at 18 that government work could be at odds with her previous political campaigns.
Clearly, the House is not a predictable course, with an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shaping the public debate.
But when I look at the examples above, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unfinished alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had been hearing for so long.
But with Obama's approval ratings dropping below 45 percent this week, the book has made it all the harder to get back to 2008.
It makes me long for the many promises that have been dissolved into air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to take a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again", he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest with his parental leave plans because his daughters are getting pregnant and could therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal battle over paying $6 million in carbon taxes, made the claim as he tried to clear questions off the table about whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important in deciding whether to eliminate or reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He has a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she gets paid parental leave or not", Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax, with a 53-vote lead after the recount.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the vote counting process to speed it up.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the end of the voting?
"We need a better system", he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you walk in, you type the data into a computer, you vote instantly, and then you get the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to vote with pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new position very seriously.
Public office is about public service.
"We seek no reward but that of history, namely, that we can serve this community at a critical time", he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the situation, further indicating that the worldwide investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in their investigations into the world's largest financial market, which changes hands for $5.3 trillion a day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the Libor interbank scandal has brought about.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this matter is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators", the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the situation said that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been laid off from his current position as European head of spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was laid off this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers have been charged with any misconduct.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people familiar with the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating an alleged currency manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed to deal in money market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through instant messages and e-mails from several years ago looking for instances of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area which has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years but has come under pressure this year because low currency volatility limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal, saying that it is nearly impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks means that man can influence the market even at very low ticket prices.
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had this week fired a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and is cooperating with them.
"We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained", Credit Suisse explained.
Painted the fence on the Bechtle plot
A group of the Swiss Weed initiative has beautified the fence on the Bechtle plot on the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
They also cleaned and widened the footpath, a press release said.
The planned cover for the collapsing house in the rear of the plot had not been allowed for safety reasons, as the site was in danger of sliding off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed on the beautification with his colleague Reinhard Domke from BI.
Before the BI action, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
This did not, however, disturb the approximately 20 members of the Citizens' Initiative in their action.
Their slogan on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
She was warning of the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In the conversation with many passersby in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that many will do better with the realization of the city project, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they're starting to resign because the city is still delaying these answers, according to BI.
As we have heard, the mayor's public statements are also having an impact.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the outcome of the thermal bath if the population voted against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some appear to be frightened, while others see it as a "dumb attempt to blackmail" the population, the BI press release continues.
The BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the help.
Ranknick-Schelte for Schiris: Mane is not the swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sporting director of the "bulls" by the referees.
"There is a dangerous trend at the moment that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the swallow king category", he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was the 3-0 win for Mane against Grödig last Sunday, when the Senegalese turned a supposed spectacle into doom - which was not, as the TV images showed.
"A gross misjudgment", said Rangnick, who called Harkam "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot with determination: "I would have behaved in every single situation the same way as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself doesn't want to have any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted", the 46-year-old stressed.
In view of the success, however, Rangnick agreed to a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for it: 'Really good,'" he said.
There's not much to show for it.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
I'm gonna let it go on like this.
There will be hardly any changes in the staff during the winter transfer window.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Unless a player comes forward with the wish that he wants to leave the club", Rangnick explained.
The Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
It's a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By a vote of five to four, the judges ruled that the unique mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  requiring U.S. citizens to purchase health insurance or pay a fine by 2014  is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law and held that the provision in the Health Act that states either have to expand access to Medicaid or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid benefits was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
Norway: A Norwegian village is lit up with giant mirrors
With giant mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Because of the low sunlight, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
Three giant reflectors at 45 metres were the dream of the century on Wednesday.
"Finally!" exclaimed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers dressed themselves in sun chairs, while others wore sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen proposed that mirrors be used to direct the rays into the valley.
This basic idea has been in place since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million crown (about 615 000 euros) project.
For some years now, a similar structure has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine town of Viganella.
Post is hardly empty on Sundays
"Many citizens may not have noticed, the red dots for Sunday school are still on various mailboxes in the city centre and the districts, but if you read the fine print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that Sunday school is no longer held", the FDP said.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, the post office is located in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld.
The question of whether the work in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still carried out on Sundays is not answered in the reply to the FDP's question.
The Social and Youth Policy spokesman for the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up on this.
Sunday school is an important postal service in the postal service.
"This is a radical and unreasonable thinning of this enterprise, despite the increase in the price of letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the Liberal Group's municipal association, supports his colleagues in the group: "What bothers me is the fact that the hours of rest are being changed or even cancelled in secret".
The post office is miles away from the city.
"At least the mailboxes in Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays", Bittner and Röhrenbeck say.
The same applies to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens, who should be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday school on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city council whether the city administration was planning to hold talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
He knows there is also a Sunday school in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken out in favour of privatisation.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere", Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become considerably more expensive.
The city magistrate is hearing this morning on a proposal from transport commissioner Stefan Majer (Greens).
The Commission has also proposed a reduction in the parking charges.
The aim is not to increase prices, but to reduce the time available for parking machines from 30 minutes to 20 minutes.
The city council will decide in December.
The retail trade committee of the IHK Frankfurt thinks this is "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking in front of the shop is "a significant advantage for smaller specialist dealers".
The Verkehrsklub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and in fact long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast action surprises hosts
With a narrow squad, the Men I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The Elbers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
But it soon became clear that, even at an advanced age, they could not keep up with the rapid actions of the Joy Cities.
The Gönninger were extremely hard hit by the hard and placed blows.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz had played through the centre of the net and were not in position to block the defence.
Two high first-round wins clearly expressed the superiority of the pleasure cities in all matters.
In the face of this crushing and decisive performance, the third set was then won somewhat lazyly and reluctantly to the final score of 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, TV Baiersbronn, which has clearly established itself in Nagold, will be facing a much more powerful opponent.
The following are the names of the members of the Board of Directors of TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced off in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in the ball-taking; the accuracy was also sometimes lacking in the passing, and in some critical scenes of the game, the exuberance prevented the eye from looking for possible points gains.
In this performance-balanced match, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently demonstrated the great physical effort and gratifying commitment of both teams.
Day of care at the little English cabin
For the fifth day of care in the continuation of the Natura 2000 project in the Upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
On the basis of suggestions from the population, the view of the valley should be cut open on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, Kaiser said, called this area the highlight of the gorge, where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the participants for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It gives every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
The tourist aspect can be accompanied by environmental considerations.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Protection Department of the Government Office in Freiburg, following the welcome by Councillor Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
The tourist objective of the long-term view, according to Tribukait, is similar to the objective of preserving the now heavily grown old common pasture with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome forest barriers.
They need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she would not fail to break a spear for the proposed biosphere reserve at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere reserve also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised UNESCO status and thus a continuous complement to the LIFE project and the past care days for the future.
After these various presentations, Head of Unit Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been felled in advance, and the logger was ready to call them in.
A group of helpers were to take care of the clearing of chalk bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone grill.
The goal was the view from the vantage point.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the small town of Löffingen, with its 7514 inhabitants, intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior policies, and its own town halls, can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet announced himself.
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for mayor because of his age, is the 46-year-old banker and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The deadline for submission of applications is Monday, 11 November, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a slew of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents relate to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the complaint, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones running Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its bid several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After being outbid by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also motivated in part by Motorola's patent library.
Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patent at auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so, according to the complaint.
Rockstar is seeking a large settlement from Google, as it claims Google's patent infringement was intentional, according to the indictment.
Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mark the end of political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges dressed in black robes of the court, which sits on the Nile and is modeled after an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life of absolute freedom, true democracy and stability", said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been heavily targeted by the government since its founding 84 years ago as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy shortly after 11am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp of the Mubarak era, traffic was only briefly halted so that the convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" mocking the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as the candidate of the Islamists but of all those who wanted to bring to fruition the efforts of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wooden-paved chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi went to Cairo University to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army band playing the national anthem, which he listened to in a high-pitched position.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest auditorium with speakers saying "The army and the people are one".
Cairo University, founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, vowing to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the ousted head of state.
But by taking the oath of office in court, and not as usual in parliament, he is bowing to the military's will, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg disco is having two great nights .
The new season at the Falkenberg disco "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday night is called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday night is going on with a U25 party.
Of course, the organizers promise great beats and cool sounds on both days.
Workers fall from ladders, seriously injured
On Thursday, while replacing a defective sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell off a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a restaurant.
As he climbed the ladder that was leaning against the roof gutter, it slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg Regional Hospital by the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
South African rapist sentenced to two life sentences
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the effects of the severe injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty of the crime earlier in the week.
The act had caused national horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The sight of the youths was so horrifying that the nurses and nurses needed psychological help.
Kana had admitted during the trial to being in a bar with Booysen the night of the murder.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied responsibility for the girl's death.
The police initially assumed that there were several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a daily occurrence in South Africa, with some 64,000 reports of sexual violence per year.
This is almost ten times the number of people living in Germany, which has 82 million people, but is significantly more populous than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's organizations in South Africa estimate the number of cases of sexual violence to be between 10 and 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the outset that the most important thing for ham is the pigs' eggs, and turbomast is not a good condition for this.
So can ham, which you can get in any supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli, the head of the big ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo the way the "Adler" company works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham", as Jumbo calls the Black Forest ham.
He's got to wear a hair protection and a coat to get inside the factory.
Jumbo, too, has to disinfect his hands before he can reach the microphone.
Jumbo for reinforcement at Schnellimbiss in Waldshut
"I'm getting a lot of work done here", the TV producers say, "Black Forest ham is a mass-produced product".
16,000 bars a week speaks for itself.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what is important about quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm curious to see what happens when you measure Roberto Blanco", Jumbo said cynically.
This is the level of private television in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer sees that the dismantling of the blocks is still manual.
Because Black Forest ham is traditionally found on the shelf without bones.
The secret of ham is the spice mix with the salt.
The smoke tower and the smoke-firing make Jumbo look like a submarine.
The trick is, pine branches in the smoke give the black forest ham a special taste.
20 days in the smoke, they'll turn the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the jumbo", he announces the test feeding.
"It's really good", the TV star concludes.
It will be a way of life for all involved.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The tour operator now expects adjusted annual profit before tax of between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million in its earlier forecast.
If current targets are met, this will represent a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As announced by CEO Graham Turner, Flight Centre achieved an eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start to the second half, particularly in its Australian and UK private business.
"Since the start of the year, our 10 countries have been profitable and some of them are well on their way to record annual pre-interest and tax revenues", he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings drivers.
In Australia, the leisure sector recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, the UK leisure business of Flight Centre did well, while business customers were spending less.
US business recovered from the weaker first half of the year, with full year profits expected for the third year running.
Flight Centre's stock went up three cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are being closed to focus on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will be required to cover at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The test also includes unseen texts to encourage wider reading.
The combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils will have to take a separate GCSE language test, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and Mathematics, the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the examining authority, will announce a reorganisation of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said there was a "broad consensus" that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, stressing that GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths  116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year  than most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to add more time to the math curriculum, coalition groups say that the comprehensive math test  combined with a greater weighting of the subject in rankings  will probably encourage schools to add more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on 'real-life problems', including financial mathematics.
Lure beautiful animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors are presenting the performance show of the district association this weekend at the town hall.
The evaluations were made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this great exhibition.
Breeders from the Soest region show their best animals here, as do young Wickeder hobbyists who show their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and awarded outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the evaluation of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will take place Saturday at 2.30 p.m. by Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 a.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., when the winner's honour is followed.
Guests are also invited to a raffle filled with lavish prizes and a tasty cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson is parting ways with her legendary blonde curls and performing for the first time with a new head of hair.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the ecumenical dialogue forum
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Castle Museum will be on the topic "Hell and Hell - Theological Reflections on the Present-Day Dealings with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, the Salem Castle and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look into the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people in past centuries had known too much about it, relying on those images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas", the modern prophetic teaching is more marked by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness about the hopes of fulfillment.
"The greater hope has been rightly driven away by criticism of religion", says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the annoyance of death".
The question of the yearning "to dream that everything will be all right in the end" is related to this.
Johanna Rahner, born in Baden-Baden in 1962, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwig University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She graduated as a doctor of theology in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a chair in Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hostages: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg reaffirm their faith at the Confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths from the Spiritual Care Unit at Kleinen Heuberg were confirmed.
The morning service was accompanied by the Laudato-Si group, and the afternoon by the Youth Choir The Spirit.
When the young people received the sacrament of initiation, they said Yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the holy spirit.
The firm had been preparing for the big feast day in recent months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the congregation.
In different projects they learned about various tasks of Christian community life and together experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race enthuses participants
In fine weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round-trip route over the hills around the lake.
This is reported by Ulrich Knobel from the Illmensee Sports Club.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to pursue their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two German top-class juniors were also in the starting lineup: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German championships.
These two could have set off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time to the finish and defended his title as overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again second.
In the women's race, it was Theresa Duelli of Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the podium.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, but the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
The main race this year had even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to disengage from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a semi-professional mountain bike racer from the Black-Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl and a team mate were two-time world champions in the 12-hour race.
That year he became European champion in this special discipline.
And Roland Ballerstedt, who has already claimed two German titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a final in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl ran over the finish line first.
Just one second behind, the routine Ballerstedt secured second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third overall.
In the women's qualifying, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time-trial winner in the main race.
The second place was secured by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
The athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized running of the event.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical aid to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or on your mobile
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to be named CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father pass out and travel to hospitals that did not have the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma there that would affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon", says Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy", says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the United States has one doctor for every 413 persons.
But even if there were a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of the country's health expenditures are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty", says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his countrymen suffered made Bwelle determined to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others are forced to get into minibuses and drive over unfortified terrain with their strapped medical equipment on the roof to the villages that need help.
Things don't always work out.
On more than one occasion, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best lodging the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle  with his broad smile and boundless energy  is happy to join in the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip", said Bwelle.
They come from a 60 kilometre radius around the village of  and that is on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates  a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
At night, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go to the recovery area to make room for the next one.
The group's generator powers the lighting for the O.R. and disinfection equipment, and Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a strenuous schedule, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of the work they've done.
The group  a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students  performed 700 free surgeries last year and know that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he had received on a hernia now enabled him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family", the man said.
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, Bwelle says, he finances 60% of his charity work, the rest coming from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Bwell's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe to support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience that they would never get back home.
"We can be in surgeries, helping to pump blood or holding instruments for Dr. Bwelle", explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon and often bring donated sanitary equipment.
Once in Yaoundé, however, Bwelle takes care of the accommodation, transportation, and guidance.
"He is without a doubt a hero", says O'Malley.
He has dedicated his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
Bwelle is not burdened by almost constant work.
He finds great joy in helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his Father.
"I'm so happy when I do this job", says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent in the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is a character created by Horst Janson.
Janson is an old bunny in his own business, the performing arts.
No one can fool old Santiago when he's fishing.
It's a great way to complement each other.
You almost think you can see the wrinkles on the old man's neck that the fisherman boy Manolo talks about.
When Santiago sits in the chair, tired of life, it's real with Janson.
Besides, the role of the old fisherman is a character role that Janson excels in.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who never gave up and ultimately won the battle against the fish with his knowledge and his willpower.
Janson has performed extensively as a soloist.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann is playing the old man in the boat outside the fishing village.
During the performance, he highlights the scene that is active: the Santiago hut, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the life of Cuba with her songs and her beautiful voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: The Descent to the Romans
A wastewater canal from Roman times has been preserved below Cologne, at a length of about 120 metres.
If you visit Cologne, you won't pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise to a height of some 157 meters, making it the second-tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who marvel at the two filigree towers of the church know that there is much to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his tours is the service center of Cologne-Tourismus directly at the cathedral.
The tour starts off in a very unimpressive way: "We start in the underground garage", says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a city that was car-friendly, so only the small remains of the old city walls remained.
Most of the parking lot users are therefore rushing past the Roman remains today and just parking their car.
But if you look closely, you will discover an archaeological site in Deck D2 that is separated by metal bars.
The ruins are about five meters high and are made of merchants' size stones.
"They are remnants of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century A.D"., says Schulze.
Before returning to the light of day, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look into a dark, 50 feet [15 m] deep shaft.
This is the well of the old cathedral, which, unfortunately, is hardly noticed.
The next stop on the tour is the Praetorium, where the participants descend into the depths.
We are here to witness the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Prefect of the CCAA.
A visitor wants to know what CCAA means.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in plain German means "City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippinenses, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the cult of the Emperor".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the hall of the exhibition, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want", Schulze encourages the guests.
Schulze has one more surprise.
After getting the key from the register, he leads the group to a 16-foot-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath", he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep in the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, the lower end of the mikveh, whose origins date back to the eighth century, is marked by varying water levels due to the changing level of the Rhine.
The mikveh will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is due to begin shortly.
But it will be a few years before completion.
Leg almost chopped off: Reprint of the Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rock scene is being re-rolled after over four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the Landgericht Frankfurt (Oder).
It's accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants remained silent for the opening.
They say they were active in the rock scene and were part of the bandidos.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in June 2009 in Finowfurt together with unknown accomplices.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man nearly lost his leg.
The victims were said to be from a rival group, the Hells Angels.
One of them was a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a multi-vehicle chase.
The prosecution said it was a show of force and a fight over territory.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proved that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators wore masks and were not identified.
The Federal Court of Justice, after review by the prosecution, reversed the judgment and referred it back to the Landgericht for reconsideration.
One of the defendants is currently on remand for another offense.
The first was to reconstruct the events of the night of the crime.
The Commissioner in charge of the investigation was called as a witness.
The centerpiece was cell phone conversations of the defendants and others who had been intercepted by the police.
It's hard to believe that rockers in court almost always follow a law they think is better than their own - and don't testify.
That goes for the victims, too.
At the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Prosecutor's Office said on request that new clues had emerged since the last trial.
The trial is scheduled for 11 more days.
The throwaway society doesn't think
It's been a long night, the music's loud and the mood's good, but eventually you're going home.
Only, in the stomachs of the people in the front and back seats, hunger is noticeable.
Of course, it may be some cocktail or sect responsible!
What's closer than chilling out at the next drive-in to indulge in a little something?
I admit, I like to be a part of it, whether it's late at night or early in the morning, when it's fast food.
A few fries, a Coke, a burger - and then nothing but home and bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers become apparent.
What's wrong with throwing your fast food bags out the window all the time?
Thrown-out paper bags are found on roadsides and in parking lots, especially on weekends.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or to the next dumpster?
It's not just that paper is ruining the landscape.
Bags have also covered transport facilities such as control boards, causing accidents.
The Commission has not yet decided on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to radioactive substances.
If you're out at night, especially with several people in your car, you know what a back seat can look like after a night of partying: clothing, bottles, and other trash.
A few bags would be nothing, more or less - unlike the street, where no one wants to tread on the food scraps of others.
I can see the day coming when cities and communities will be too stupid to clean up - and fast food chains will have to charge for their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health care policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama yesterday backtracked on his oft-repeated, unequivocal promise: If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.
After hundreds of thousands of people received letters of resignation from their insurance company, Republicans have accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it", he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the layoffs, Obama urged those Americans who received such notices to look for new insurance on the open market.
This would enable most citizens to obtain better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or at a lower cost than anticipated.
"They'll come up with a better offer", he said.
The government said it was not surprising that the five percent of the population who had insurance themselves would have to look at a different rate because their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better", Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform has been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else", she said.
I'm determined to win back your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to a counselor sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was recorded after a dispute with Republican Representative Billy Long of Missouri over whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long repeatedly pressed Sebelius with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a government-sponsored insurance policy in order to sign up for a plan on HealthCare.gov that she now wanted to sell to millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, the day before.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanon's Hezbollah, CNN reported.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, blaming the Israelis for the attack.
Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base showing Russian S-125 Neva missile defense systems and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 said have a range of 35 kilometres and can carry warheads weighing up to 70 kilograms.
The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed Israeli government official as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack but was not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai, writing in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth, pointed out that the Syrian regime had previously tried, with some success, to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any Syrian attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would be crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry admits in unprecedented fashion that US espionage has gone "unreasonably far"
John Kerry made an unexpected admission indicating a softening of the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes, saying that in certain cases the spying had 'gone unreasonably far'.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he shared responsibility with Barack Obama for turning on "Autopilot" when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
The leaked information has sent the US government into a diplomatic firestorm of outrage from its allies.
In a video-transmitted speech at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no question that the president and I and others in government have been told of some things that have gone on autopilot, simply because the capability was there, which goes back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to 9/11.
He was the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: 'In some cases this has gone too far.'
The president is determined to bring clarity, and therefore is conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons will not be compromised in this trial.
But Kerry insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance efforts had saved many lives.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up".
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have been told in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged US espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to European Parliament members and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations because of frustration with the National Security Agency's surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans stay on board our joint efforts against terrorism", Murphy, a first-time Democrat in the Senate and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together on counterterrorism despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were false and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents shared by Snowden that the NSA had been monitoring the cell phones of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of national intelligence, James Clapper, defended spying on allies as necessary, saying it was common on both sides.
In all the commotion, Murphy said his office was preparing for the congressional trip that was scheduled to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members who will be attending will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route is still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also spoke of some very serious words.
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept that we are not the only ones spying", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, and US surveillance activities.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is looking for a mission from Nicolai Müller.
He's gonna try to train with the team tomorrow.
He's only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his use in the short term", said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old is hoping to get his best six-goal scorer.
Mainz has already had to give up the injured players Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman appeals against Thailand's prison sentence
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming she was raped by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a Phuket provincial court on June 15 of making false statements after she told Thai police that she had been raped by a local taxi driver in the early hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
Later, however, video footage showed her safely back at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
She was in police custody at the scene until the trial.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rugby league player who has turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra to ask for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's welfare and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are very worried, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible", said Tunks.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free on 50,000 baht bail.
Australian reports said she was on holiday in the southern Thai resort of Krabi.
On the other side of the court, Bamford was heard to be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also result in a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may be trying to improve its damaged tourist image following the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore acquittal is forthcoming.
