This fact not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread), but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
The feathers of this animal were said to be brownish-brown above, with a pale or carotenous underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a highly developed tusk called a rachis, but they do have other features - rays and hooks - researchers concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or display. The scientists suggest that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult feathers and not a young one.
The researchers believe that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, it is a specimen of the feathers of an adult animal, not the dusty feathers of a young.

France has traditionally voted without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in the envelope, stating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.

The candidates can send representatives who are then witness to the whole process.

You can make all kinds of shapes, you can roll it into tiny pieces.
It can be pulled into thin wire that can be bent and braided. It can be split or pressed into sheets.
It can be processed to a considerable thickness and attached to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was often used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called  illuminated manuscripts.
You can make your own indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice depends on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.

If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite to make the call.
Satellite in space receives a call and then bounces its signal back down almost instantly.

below are medium-sized felines, feeding on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the ecological zero system, i.e. that each cat has its own tasks that do not allow it to compete with others.
Lion are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to 30 females and young.
The females are usually closely related and represent a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion pack behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus (genus panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar from a full throat, but rather like a sentence of sharp, screamed words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals for food (prey) by smell, whereby they can sense the direction they have moved on the ground.
They can see very well at night, thanks to their night vision, and they can move very quietly. They hunt by blending in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (small population) separates from the main population from which it came (for example, when they cross a mountain ridge or a river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to get back), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as a new population adapts to their new environment, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans breathe out.

Mosasaurus was the top predator of his time, so he didn't fear anything except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were covered with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set of razors planted on the top floor, meaning that nothing that crossed his path had a chance to escape.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a broken tongue, and their diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe they were cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, even a large dinosaur like the T. rex was no match for them.
Though most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual meal compositions, including wild boar, peacock, grasshopper, and a type of rodent called a plush.

Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology pusch or the technological imperative, or the belief that human destiny is governed by all-pervasive logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.

We can say, for example, that if motor cars appear, it will inevitably lead to the development of roads.
The national road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership is also driving an increase in road accidents, which is causing the invention of new medical techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romance carried a significant element of cultural determinism borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged and these, because they were consistent with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.

The city's fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
The importance of the silk declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders brought back to Europe valuables such as silk and spices, which were more valuable at home than they were on the Byzantine markets.

Gothic reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.


Through the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances of that time was the use of buttons to tie clothes, as a result of the Crusades.
self-sustaining farming is farming carried out to produce only the quantity of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient farmers, and this is still happening in many developing countries.
Subcultures connect like-minded individuals who feel left out by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.

one of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident, or intentional abuse, were not socialized as adults.
Wolf children are children who have been incarcerated for long periods of time (usually by their own parents), in some cases they have been abandoned because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, and then been abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully raised by nonhuman animals, a feral child exhibits almost identical behaviour (within physical possibilities) as a given caretaker animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
e project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes a step further.
Kostra is not a teaching method but rather a tool that provides support to those individuals who undertake to acquire new practice, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The ladder can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of ladder, but also a little bit of a clip in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual constructs designed to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student himself.
children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that lacks proper nutrition, care and education, but such cases do exist.
We believe the foster care system will be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster parents, stable education and reliable health care.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add a further dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
andsocialization are proposed as important motivational elements for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)
Personal engagement andcontinuing interest were also identified by Eighme and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micromessages facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
In particular, you can tell if the other person is lying to you by correctly interpreting the micro-virus.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, suggested that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge honesty.
even suggesting that such abilities to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
mutations add a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
segregation and recombination blur the differences between the two sets in both directions within each generation.
It's hard for primates with digestive systems similar to humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from plant sources that are available in open savannah.
And if they don't, the consequences are serious: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to get protein from would be leaves and legumes, but these are hard for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.
The food from animals (anth, termite, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides high levels of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.

Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (1060 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively silent alarm clock, which will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
The degree of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more good the life force brings. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that's stopping us from achieving it is our own tension and negativity.
Tibet buddhism is based on the teachings of buddha but has been extended by the mayhan way of love and many techniques from indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple in principle. They are the kundalini of yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened by the poses of this yoga, the breathing exercises, the mantras and the visualizations.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy in WWII, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. The clashes of systems, processes and cultures led to the end of the war, the breakdown of cooperation between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It lasted another 40 years and actually fought with proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian outskirts.

Transport by boat is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional role of the navy was to ensure the state's ability to transport people and goods, but at the same time, the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
one of the most notable recent examples was the north atlantic campaign during world war ii where the americans tried to move men and equipment across the atlantic ocean to help the british.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this operation, mostly using submarines.
lf the Allies failed, then Germany might have conquered Britain, just like the rest of Europe.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures and often watched over by shepherds, often from the ranks of children or teenagers similar to the more familiar sheep herders.

Though mostly consisting of only parallel planks, the trail allowed the horses to reach greater speeds and carry heavier loads than on other, somewhat thicker, roads of the time.

This became commonplace, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the wagons wear out.
Then wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The earliest known mode of transport was walking, with humans walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
their ancestor Australopithecus did not normally walk upright.

To reduce future suffering to some extent, we can live more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists.
In many cases, this is the same as symptomatic treatment, but unless we're just looking for a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and get rid of it.

After being passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, which are now called "Dunlap prints".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8
one was sent to George Washington on July 6 who read it to his troops in New York on July 9 and one copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, or 25 prints from Dunlap's printing press.

Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.

Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both insidious and beetles are tame, adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their host.
United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.

Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop RS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can decide on a plan to adopt their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the child's parents can become another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually the guideline for most scientific research.
Experiment is a test that is used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but for scientific research, it's also important to ask questions and observe.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotelis's ideas were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
many of the recorded rhythms in physiology and behaviour often depend fundamentally on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clock is a self-contained oscillator that continues in a freely-flowing cycle time without the presence of external stimuli.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the major pieces of evidence that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either labeled DNA in the radioactive phase with phosphorus or labeled protein in the radioactive phase with sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells of the germline have been affected.
Only mutations in the germ line can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-oriented tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of admiring the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem concerned.

Everyday morning, people leave the small towns in cars, going to work, and in the meantime, others pass them, going to work, to the place where they just left.
This dynamic transport is driven by everyone and supports a private vehicle transport system.
sciences now suggest that this massive carbon economy has upended the biosphere from its stable state, which has supported human evolution for the past two million years.

In developed countries, you rarely see a similar level of complaints about water quality or about collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so much complaint, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something deeper?

Traffic flow is unfortunately difficult to study, because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a certain range; therefore, the operation usually has some reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, relationships between three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider choice of small spaces where they can hide from predators.
Today, they are the only insect that can't fold wings, scales and scales.
1000 years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system goes around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), moves around the earth.

The Amazon River is 6,387 km long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Though stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in either size or technical precision.
The Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the relics of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legal regulations and official communications.



Aristoteles, the philosopher, believed that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four clusters of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they evolved into new substances that formed what we see.
Alloys are basically mixtures of two or more metals.Remember, there are lots of elements in the periodic table.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Toda la materia en el universo está formada por partículas pequeñas llamadas átomos.
The atom is so incredibly small that the dot at the end of this sentence would fit trillions of them.

Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and secondary use.
Today, people are texting on computer screens, so they can't get in touch with the clipboard.
You can only wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to keep a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons together.
It's like driving a heavy truck up a hill, and then by splitting the atomic nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is strong for about 70 km on the reverse side and about 100 km on the reverse side.
under the sea is weaker and under the mountains stronger.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas, because the crust is thinner, so the lava could easily get to the surface.
Content theory is about finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they adopt during adolescence.

Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.

This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and leading people to accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're going to be unrecognizable, and you're going to feel like you have to change everything that the team does, and do it your way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This discussion often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
members of the virtual team often act as contact points for the physical group.
often have greater autonomy than regular team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of the so-called 'invisible team' is also a unique component of the virtual team (Larson  LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
Invisible team is a management team to which each member is subordinate.Invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for implementing the concept of a learning organisation is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively used across the functional components of the organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be displayed.
The result is that the process of a cooperating organisation overcoming a barrier can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
To be innovative, an organisation's management must create an innovative corporate culture, introduce knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organisations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for the theoretical approach to the study of the cognac, thus narrowing and refining this area of research.
The scientists in their research support the interconnection between brain disease and behavior.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to observe and study brain structures and processes that no one has observed before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connections to science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that automate tasks requiring intelligent action.
examples include checking, planning and scheduling, being able to respond to customer diagnoses and queries, recognising handwriting, voice and faces.
like this has become a separate discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI is now widely used in economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is embedded in a range of home computer applications and video game software.

Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual excursion sharing is also a great way to think about the trip and share experiences with future classes.

Sundarbans is the largest strip of coastal mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of mighty jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which approximately one third is covered by water areas or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian tigers can currently be found in the area.
