Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom which confirms that the COVID-19 pandemic is increasing rapidly in all countries, occurring at different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown pathogenesis was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as a pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more severe illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases observe a more severe illness requiring critical care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 further geographically expanded and currently the COVID-19 pandemic's activity in the rest of the world has moved beyond that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by the WHO case definition were reported in the 5 March edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths reported from Italy alone, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date.
Achieving cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative prevalence
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the countries' Ministries of Health, National and Regional Health Authorities and WHO reporting COVID-19 cases from each country in the world are updated every day at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and UK and compare it to the outbreak in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have hereby calculated the 14-day brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as on 15th March 2020 at 8:00 am as compared to Italy in the period 31st January - 15th March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of the 14-day brief cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Across the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (supplementary material).
This was mainly due to a sharp increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK saw a similar increasing trend in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compared to Italy in the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This particularly reflects that as of 15 March at 8:00 am, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to those in Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparative pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, differences in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients who should be screened for COVID-19 confirmation as necessary, including tracing and screening.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admissions of COVID-19 cases are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (statistics not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic manner to supplement the current surveillance data which focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study in 2010-11 found a large difference in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal per 100,000 population.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases related to &gt; 90% risk of ICU bed capacity with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's Acute Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
As cases remain in the cluster in EU/EEA countries and some regions of the UK and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore prepare themselves for the situation of continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare, especially intensive care as is occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, with the shift from mitigation to containment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is needed to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as if not implemented in time, the anticipated rapid decision increases in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures in addressing the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have few opportunities to further scale up their control efforts and reduce pressure on healthcare to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is very likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a sharp increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted from bats and produces similar symptoms by the same mechanism of action.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a timely and comprehensive review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will cover the basics on epidemiology, pathology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of disease.
Although there are still many questions to be answered, we hope this review will help in understanding and eradicating the deadly disease.
Due to the outbreak of the novel viral disease, the Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay at home for the entire holiday and several weeks afterwards.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020.
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients dying due to the virus.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is Public Enemy No. 1 and is possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment have been published, isolating many patients and determining the sequence of the virus.
The review attempts to summarise research progress in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to another disease caused by SARS and CoV, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far in relation to disease prevention and prediction as well as some other yet crucial questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common cold 4.
However, twice in this century we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with terrible illness and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1 of Figure 1, a swarm of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, was first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later the sequence of CoVs was released.
The first fatal case was reported from Wuhan on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infections were reported among healthcare providers, indicating that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan City was locked down with all its public transport closed.
The first clinical study on the disease on 24 January reported that only 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed cases had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was believed to be the starting point of infection from an unknown zoonotic source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health disaster.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure (Figure 2).2).
As the situation is rapidly escalating, the final extent and intensity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
A multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11 February 2020 presented a more updated picture of the pandemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly those aged 30-65 years.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons were above 50 years of age, very few were below 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were below 10 years of age.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 mainly spread in herds in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4. 8 (3. 0 - 7. 2) days.
The average time from onset to death was 9. 5 (4. 8 - 13) days.
The original reproduction number (R0) was 3. 77 (95% CI:3. 51 - 4. 05) and the adjusted R0 was 2. 23 - 4. 82.
The number of infected people rose sharply before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the mass traffic ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses with single RNA proteins.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The membrane (S) nozzle binds to its cellular recipient angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) respectively in glycoprotein, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and then fuses to the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cellular material; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms genomic RNA virins with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then fused into the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequence samples collected from the Hunan seafood market in Wuhan, the source of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV is genetically.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
ACE2, human SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV was found to be a recipient.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make novel small proteins encoded by orf3b and secretory proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2's orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in mixture with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was synthesized as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture could bind two S proteins that provide evidence for identification and transmission of CoV.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug testing to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Primary and intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels, respectively.
By caste comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to other CoVs, bats were considered the original nutrient of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped the virus cross the species barrier and infect humans is unknown and the transmission route is still to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans involving similar recombination with S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolins - a long-snouted, ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate nutrients for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity between the CoV found in pangolins.
However, the spread of the 1% difference across both genomes is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for solid evidence (Figure (Figure 33).
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown yet.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in artificial ambient dry environment for 48 hours and less than 20 °C and at 40%-50% humidity for 5 days.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, at 56 °C, is sensitive to ultraviolet rays for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, parasitic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore highly susceptible to the novel virus.
No detailed studies have been reported at present regarding immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4.4).
Typically, after the virus enters the nutrient, it is first recognized by the nutrient's endogenous immune system from pattern recognition receptors (PRR), including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLR).
By various routes, the virus induces expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to avoid immune responses.
Soon, an adapted immune response becomes involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus - specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus - infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro - inflammatory cytokines to assist the protective cells.
However, CoVs can block T cell functions by killing T cells.
Triiodothyronine resistance, including supplements and immunosuppressants such as C3a and C5a, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, immunes isolated from a recovered patient inactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system produces a very large number of locally free radicals which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases even multi-organ failure and death.
Elderly people with susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by herd onset are more likely to be affected and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune systems are mixed to be more likely to become infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and its range was 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on a demographic of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
Adjusting effective quarantine times based on the most accurate incubation period and thus preventing infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others is very important for health authorities.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to or infected with the virus usually require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the predominant and early symptom of COVID-19 which may be accompanied by no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, wheezing, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/ or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients had a rapid increase in the development of acute acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and severe fever even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities should be screened for virus for early diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 found that the percentage of symptoms was 98 for fever, 76 for dry cough, 55% for shortness of breath and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% patients required ventilation.
Two recent studies of herd caused by family herd and asymptomatic person transmission reported similar findings.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them required ventilation support and this is consistent with the higher mortality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were observed to be the major symptoms in SARS patients and about 14%-20% of patients required ventilation support.
The COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% as of 14 February, when the worldwide confirmed cases reached 66,576.
By comparison, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the mortality rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases based on a June 2012 demographic study.
Earlier studies reported that SARS-CoV-2's R0 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 whereas SARS-CoV's R0 was only between 2 and 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher spread potential than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
Therefore, controlling the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The start of the herd is usually from the same family or group of people or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas within the last two weeks from the onset or contact with infected persons or patients.
However, it has been reported that people can transmit the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from hospital can transmit the virus again, which warns of an extension of the quarantine period.
Patients in the early stage have normal or low peripheral white blood cell (especially lymphocyte) counts.
For example, lymphopenia and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and virulence with white blood cell counts &lt; 1×109/L &lt; 4×109/L including lymphocyte counts &lt; 1×109/L were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood and most patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte deposition in their blood.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation present in the blood, was elevated and the lymphocyte count continued to decline.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are indicated by bilateral spotted images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, mass accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The adverse effects of type - I and type - II pneumocytes reduce the level of surfactant and increase surface tension and thus reduce the ability of the lungs to swell and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst results of chest radiography often parallel the most severe condition of the disease.
The first diagnostic analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 observed the dislocation of pneumocytes, formation of haleen membrane and perforated leakage of lymphocytes in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, and polynuclear multicentre cells that were consistent with the pathology and ARDS of viral infection and similar to those in SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which can accelerate the pandemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis in China on 13 February 2020 (which no longer relied solely on RT-PCR).
The same situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and imperative to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L (about 10-100 copies per microliter of input) from 200 × 10-18 mol/L, using a dipstick, without the need for any detailed equipment.
If verified in clinical samples, it is hoped that the new technology can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with novel CoVs, physicians can provide primary supportive care to COVID-19 patients with previously used or proposed therapies to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop immunity and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks mainly the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and failure remain major threats to patients and are major causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is important for symptom relief and life saving and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-intrusive ventilation and intrusive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be assisted by modified cardiopulmonary upstream techniques used in the treatment of extracorporeal membrane brain oxygenation (ECMO), life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
At the same time, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protecting critical organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm results from overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a chain of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals which are the major causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tosylisumab, IL6-anti-monoclonal immunosuppressants, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include changes in T cell directed immune response; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumab; inhibitor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids as immunosuppressants were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can produce serious side effects, particularly nonvascular osteoarthritis, dramatically affecting the diagnosis.
Nevertheless, the use of short-term courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses is recommended with caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malberg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other monopoly RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to conduct two tests on persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
Also, baricitinib, interferon-α, iopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with iopianavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma and immune production from recovered patients
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen.
Immunoglobulins (Ig) are produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign substances and they identify and directly inactivate unique molecules in the pathogen.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with reduced inflammation and viral load and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, validation and clarification are necessary to propose the method for widespread use.
Also, despite the therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific immunes so quickly to fight the global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code that codes for effective immunity or to test for effective immunity to essential proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can increase the production of immunity faster.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in a different formula based on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM principles.
Most effective components are still unknown or invalid because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Do capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in the treatment of COVID-19 were seen in several provinces in China, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), where 87% of patients using TCM, while Hubei Province, where TCM was used in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as number of patients and severity, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zheng and colleagues published a study to compare only Western Medicine (WM) treatment and the combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature to normal, for symptoms to go away and for hospitalization in the WM+TCM group was significantly shorter than the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the symptomatic worsening rate (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) than in the WM group alone and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group (8.8% vs. 39%) than in the WM group alone.
Nevertheless, more well-controlled trials are still awaited on a large scale and in more centres for the efficacy and safety of TCM.
It would also be interesting to identify the mechanism of action and if possible to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed patients of COVID-19 experience a great deal of fear of highly contagious and deadly disease and those who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroid induced insomnia, can cause more discomfort and mental distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychological disorders were reported including persistent stress, restlessness, panic attacks, mood swings, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak can make people more anxious and worried about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to patients, suspected persons and persons coming into contact with COVID-19, as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include setting up multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission link between animal cells and sensitive nutrients from infected humans and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics due to increasing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-term and potent inactivating immunity and/or defensive immunity against SARS-CoV.
Biologically engineered vaccines have been evaluated in the biology of SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and in lethally challenging strains and their safety against zoonotic virus infection are still to be determined before the start of any clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS was phased out 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to arise in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the areas of the epidemic.
Vaccination strategies for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and subunits of recombinant proteins have been developed and some have been evaluated in animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunized individuals is a vital and critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, the difficulty of overcoming the long time required in vaccine development (average 18 months) and dynamic variations of CoVs is challenging.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its full diagnostic process in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality among patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is essential for health-care agencies to create disease-diagnostic models to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In a study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% patients were over 50 years of age, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and were significantly older than those who did not need such care (at median age of 51 vs 66), indicating that age is a predictor of outcome for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and atherosclerosis.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2, may also bind to ACE2-positive collagenic cells that may cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are deeply correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal Laboratory Findings: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in blood indicate the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and have been proposed as a potential predictor of disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
A correlation of CRP level with the severity of COVID-19 and disease diagnosis has also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogenesis (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) may also help in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, particularly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major diagnostic symptoms: Chest radiography along with other problems and the temporal progression of diagnostic symptoms should be considered for prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as combination therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of the damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoarthritis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, the steroid should be used in COVID-19 patients at low doses and for short term.
Mental Stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered from extreme stress during the COVID-19 outbreak, as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Providing psychological counselling and long term support is essential to help these people get out of stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 shows different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
As well as replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and produces mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection like other CVDs that cause colds.
Therefore, infected patients can generate large amounts of virus during daily activities in the early stage or incubation period, with great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very ill, while most transmissions did not occur during the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Large efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantines of almost the entire population in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these steps are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, which points to the ups and downs of the pandemic.
The most optimistic forecast is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the downward phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be far more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago indicating that the new virus identified could become a recurrent case, similar to influenza.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which indicate that current strategies may be working.
Initially, one million cases were predicted with half a million deaths from Ebola.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in infectivity and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 pandemic to SARS and MERS is given below (Figure 55)
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible from coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in the feces, which also raises a new possibility of fecal-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers, were likely due to clinical infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, colleagues and those who are in close contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from passing from a potentially infected person into the air or sticking to the surface of things, from where they can pass to others.
However, only N95 (series #1860s) masks can prevent viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm from entering the respiratory tract, with only 5% of viruses being able to fully cross; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also pass through five surgical masks placed one on top of the other, healthcare providers with direct contact with patients should necessarily wear N95 (Series #1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers should wear fitted isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through his inflammatory eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear transparent face shield or glasses when working with patients.
The general public in affected or potentially affected areas are strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected persons.
A distance of three feet is considered to be the proper distance for people to keep away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV would have made China extremely cautious based on its deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human transmissibility and limited reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
The message relieved the public of much fear, especially as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to limit the disease to a minimum in Wuhan came.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements as every word matters to citizens and can change their attitudes and judgment; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal notification from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in limiting a potential pandemic at an early stage rather than trying to console the public; and (4) frequently and periodically examine and improve society's response system by releasing targeted and effective practices to increase public awareness of the pandemic.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has given rise to the sense of recurrence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to limit the pandemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and women more than young people, and the severity and mortality rates in older people are also higher than younger people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when asymptomatic while SARS patients often do so when they are seriously ill, which makes it much more difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads with greater speed and widespreadness than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several serious cases remain to be resolved, which are as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat-like SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
The original nutrient, say, which species was the intermediate species in the transmission of the virus from bats to humans?
Without finding the answer to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop transmission and the outbreak could recur at any time.
Although molecular replication and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2, binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and subsequently cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-specific cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, going away slowly like SARS or will it continue to recur periodically like the flu?
It is necessary, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return our lives to normal.
Animal origin of human coronaviruses
Mutations and adaptations have led to the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts (including humans) over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as colds.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the devastating and deadly nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back into the spotlight and surprised us with a higher infectivity but reduced pathogenicity than its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be useful to us.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
Information is also available on the intermediate coenzyme nutrients of some HCoVs.
Identification of animal nutrients has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Examining CoV-nutrient interactions in animals can also provide important insights into the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of current information about seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of discovery as well as on zoonotic origin and intergenetic transmission.
Importantly, we see the comparison and variation of different HCoVs from the perspective of the gradual evolution of viruses and gene recombination.
The current CoV Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is discussed in this perspective.
At the same time, the need for successful nutrient replacement and the implications of the gradual evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease have also been highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the family Coronaviridae which includes groups of enveloped, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genome of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kilobases, were named CoVs because of their crown - like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have segmentless genomes that have similar structure.
Approximately two thirds of the genome consists of two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyprotein is further processed to produce 16 non - structural proteins named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many heredity-specific helper proteins are also encoded by different heredities of CoVs.
Based on variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four generations (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV generation is mostly HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Eugenic evidence has shown that bats and mosquitoes are mostly gene sources for alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant hosts of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously overcome species barriers and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively high number of patients with a higher probability of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypertensive manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal drainage of cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been collected through detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until before the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that infection by HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, infecting over 8000 people with a crude case mortality rate of around 10%, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in recent history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak spawned a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm bells are ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have an anogenetic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Many evidence support the gradual evolution of all HCoVs from bats, with viruses that are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show high genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges for China and the world.
Detecting the zoonotic source of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, drivers and binding factors of species transgression.
It may guide or facilitate the discovery of coccyx, intermediate and enhancer animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 with significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review we present an overview of the zoonotic origin, intergenetic transmission and pathogenicity of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural cell nutrients, but become pathogenic after intergenetic transmission to the new nutrient.
We will also review the trend of gradual evolution of HCoVs in which the increase in infectivity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The consequences of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from nasal drainage of infected common cold patients, different CoVs were isolated from several infected animals including turkey, rat, cow, pig, cat and dog.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decades.
A brief summary of the chronological history of HCoV discovery (Table 1) will be informative and informative.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection, which later adapted to grow in the cell lines of the WI-38 lungs.
Cold symptoms including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat were observed in 10~20% of patients infected with HCoV-229E with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a sequential pathway and organ transplantation in the brain of a milk-sucking rat.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to infection caused by HCoV-229E which are symbolically indistinguishable from infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are likely to be transmitted predominantly during winter with warmer weather.
Typically, the period of gradual development of both these viruses is less than a week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild cold.
A few immunocompromised patients have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS also known as "atypical pneumonia" was the first well-documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the cause, the third HCoV discovered, is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be identified in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
With the spread of SARS epidemic across many countries and continents, 8,096 cases were recorded with 774 deaths.
Apart from the most transmissible, it was estimated that with a gradual growth period of 4 to 7 days and maximum viral impact appearing on the 10th day of illness, there could be an increase of approximately two secondary cases due to each case.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle aches, headaches, fever, malaise and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, abnormal liver function screening and increased creatinine kinase are common laboratory-related abnormalities of SARS.
Transmitted air cell damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys can also become infected in these severe cases, which can be especially fatal for immunocompromised patients, usually with cytokine storm.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy from a relative of an indicator patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, many efforts have been made in research of HCoVs.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Diseases caused by HCoV-NL63 are commonly characterized by the appearance of colds-colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis.
In another independent study, the same virus was isolated from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it has spread worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to inhibitory autosomal recessive autism, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly male who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was also reported to be associated with severe asthma outbreaks.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory illnesses.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well in humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons such as in the rare case of the more toxic subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in China.
Typically, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and maintain themselves in humans they also become less toxic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread among close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia, are similar to SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which has so far only been seen in MERS in diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
From mid-to-late December 2019, swarms of pneumonia patients with widespread SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As on 3rd March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with a crude case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, appearing as fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of the caste lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but more transmissible, than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and looking at the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 to the other six HCoVs has revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the pathogenesis period and the duration of the procedure of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows characteristics that are typically seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs are also characterized in transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it progresses to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether the rectal-to-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonally like cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained spread after entry into humans, will be influential on the ultimate outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
HCoVs acquired from all four communities, which cause mild symptoms, have adapted well in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have become well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both ancient HCoVs may have survived epidemics.
HCoVs that cause serious illness in humans and those that cause humans to develop serious HCoV illness have been eliminated.
For this to happen, the accumulation of adapted mutations that inhibit nutrient restriction factors must replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, the more likely it is to become fully adapted to humans.
If it becomes well adapted, its transmission to humans will be difficult to prevent with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, CoVs acquired from four communities have been transmitted to the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not require animal cells.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well in humans and cannot be sustained in human transmission.
They need to survive and spread in their zoonotic host and possibly find a chance to be transmitted to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing nutrients.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs.
At least at present it is very contagious like community acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will become fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any cell or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the gradual evolution of HCoVs, natural, coastal, intermediate and enhancing nutrients.
An animal is a gradually evolving host of HCoV if it harbors a very close ancestor with high similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The parent virus is usually well adapted and non - pathogenic to this nutrient.
Similarly, cell nutrients give HCoVs constant and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the pathogens become naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate nutrient just before or around entry into humans, it does not adapt well to the new nutrient and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as an zoonotic source of human infection and act as an enhancer nutrient by allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of human infection.
An HCoV can go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate nutrient.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate nutrient and maintain localization over a long period of time.
In this state, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural nutrient.
Epidemiological data has historically shown that the indicator case of SARS was a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence investigations indicated that there was a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG among animal traders than the general public.
Masked palm civet (Paguma larva) and raccoon dog were identified in live animal markets as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the sewers of the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that most masked palm civet from wild or farms not in contact with live animal markets was SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that masked palm civet may only be serious as an intermediate enhancer nutrient and not as a natural cocoon of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets are anti-SARS-CoV immune, the possibilities that several species of small mammals may also be intermediate enhancers of SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
These all appear to be the final nutrients of SARS-CoV.
Follow-up discovery of a natural animal nutrient of SARS-CoV revealed a very close relative bat CoV called SARS-related Rhinoceros Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV immunity and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are the nourishment of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none have been isolated as living viruses other than WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat faeces samples was demonstrated to use bat, sewer and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular entry.
Interestingly, the serum of recovering SARS patients was able to inactivate WIV1.
So far, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the greater similarity between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestral virus to SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest co-sponsors of SARS-CoV.
Eugenic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Bats CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are ethnographically close to the bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoVs have been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not be the closest co-sponsors of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels with a hooves similar to those of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivating immunity.
Living MERS-CoVs, similar to the virus found in humans, were isolated from the nostrils of humpback camels, indicating that camels are the authentic carrier of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV were observed to excrete virus with usually mild symptoms but very high levels.
Significantly, infected camels not only expel viruses through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route which is also the main route of virus excretion from bats.
However, questions still exist as there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms in many confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or some unknown transmission route involving the animal species that hosts MERS-CoV.
CoV RaTG13 isolated from bats belonging to the Rhinolephus species shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2 bat.
As with cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to determine the parental relationship.
That is, bats cannot be the closest cell nutrients to SARS-CoV-2, unless nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the animal nutrient intermediate of SARS-CoV-2 must be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of Hunan seafood with which several early cases of COVID-19, indicators of a possible animal-to-human transmission event, were associated.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (human javannics) may also harbor ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with a similarity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are in two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the lineage lineage, one of which shares a more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly diverse despite greater gene-wide sequence similarity.
An earlier study of a sick pangolin also reported finding a group of viral DNA overlapping from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used several different combined methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a viral genome of 86.3% full length.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal nutrients of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also less than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The pathway of gradual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Whereas SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin have been found to have the highest sequence similarity in RBDs, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, have the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the extreme similarity between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergence sequence evolution.
An alternative proposal favours recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife species.
As the driving force of gradual evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The closest animal-genetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been studied.
Euthanasia evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mouse.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (Applacache Ridge CoV) found in three-colored North American bats was found to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although camelliads are also suspected intermediate nutrients.
For clarity, the current information on animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Ethnological analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events of HCoVs in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species from domestic animals to infect humans around 1890, an epidemic of respiratory infections was observed.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be very close to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
There is a lot of evidence that supports the transmission of the virus from bats directly to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have come into contact with bats in their shared ecosystem habitat.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bats are diverse and non-pathogenic in alpha-CoV bats, while alpaca-alpha-CoV caused outbreaks of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas derive HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bat rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus are the direct sources of human pathogens.
It is therefore not more surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are gene pools of HCoV-229E, alpacas and humpback camels may be intermediate nutrients that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a prime example of interspecies transmission from bats to hipped camels and from hipped camels to humans.
The gradual evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, dense settlements, close social interaction and high ability to fly are all favorable conditions for bats to be ideal virus carriers.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into humpback camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted in these camels which have changed from intermediate nutrient to stable and natural nutrient.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has sporadic transmission in humans and humans remain the last carriers of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins in SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the final nutrients of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, like the sewer in the case of SARS-CoV.
Many possibilities of animal-to-human interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 are to be accepted or disproved in future studies.
First, bats may be cell carriers of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecosystems with bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which SARS-CoV-2 -related viruses were newly introduced.
Humans are infected by killing and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Immunology surveys are needed in domestic and wild animals.
Third, as noted above, SARS-CoV-2 may have recombined and adapted in a third species that came into contact with both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being explored.
In addition to the different types of animal vectors, three key factors regarding the virus are also important in the smooth crossing of species barriers of CoVs.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoVs can be considered to be "medium to high" with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per site 2 per year depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in new hosts.
CoVs contain proof-reading exoribonucleases, the deletion of which can also lead to extreme variability and degradation or reduced viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir, is thought to suppress the replication of CoV by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
Yet, the mutation rate of CoVs is a million times higher than their nutrients.
Also, the mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is markedly lower, which points to a higher degree of adaptation in humans.
Perhaps, it has already adapted to other nutrients close to humans.
As with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has become well adapted in humpbacked camels.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic flow will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA in CoVs puts additional plasticity on the genome transformation for genome mutation and recombination, increasing the possibility of interspecies co-sequential evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
It is supported by abundant unique open reading frames and protein functions encoded at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly repeatedly change prototype during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In the nutrient acting as the mixer, the fibrous change occurs mostly during CoV RNA transcription.
Very similar full-length and subgenomic RNAs can recombine to produce new CoVs.
Eutrophic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus - nutrient interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the nutrient receptor is another important factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of isolates between human and seaweed SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs with mutations on RBD of S protein in particular are thought to be rapidly adapting to different nutrients.
Typically, RBD in a CoV's S protein interacts with the cellular receptor and is selectively and intensely nutrient-bound by immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is at the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV's RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from various animals including bats, civets, rats and raccoon dogs, leading to interspecies transmission of viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in RBD separately from human and cytotoxic viral isolates and 4 of them are located in receptor - bound radicals for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of the Sevette SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations that may increase the attraction of spike protein interactions with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be important in viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that its S protein may have altered binding similarity with human ACE2.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate a 10 to 20 times greater attraction of this compound than the link between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It will also be of interest to determine whether another co-receptor would be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Several other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
The outcome of intergenetic transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
Variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and natural host hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, humpback camels and mice, may be an obstacle to intergenetic transmission.
Successful intragenetic transmission of HCoVs requires seizure of nutrient dependent factors and reversal of nutrient restricting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus - nutrient interaction have yet to be identified and described.
Non-biased genome-wide screening of nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology can be fruitful.
Emergence of novel HCoVs: Back to basics
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as the gene pool for HCoVs.
At the same time, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoVs and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the novel protein-coding gene has the potential to greatly alter viral synapses of acquisition or loss.
In SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated, but they were found to encode diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide deletion of SARS-CoVs has been characterized in isolated species at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 down into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes cell turnover.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a potential recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs lineages, with a very large number of small recombination regions in RNA-based RNA polymerases identified.
Recombination sites were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in humpback camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly caused by selection-pressure-free viruses, such as those induced by the innate immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV shows single nucleotide insertion, leading to frameshift.
Last but not least, the gradual evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressure in their co-sponsors.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs indicating an inter-adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats appeared to have adapted well to CoVs structurally and physically.
For example, defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce pathogenicity generated by CoVs.
In addition, inhibitive natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed due to the regulation of natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major tissue conformation complex category I molecules.
Furthermore, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the over-metabolism of bats may suppress CoV replication and affect proof reading by exoribonucleases, thus providing selective pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into the new nutrient.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also be developed by recombination, which can lead to new proteins or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in colostrum such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without showing a strong nutrient resistance response.
It is the secret behind why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes serious cases in human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by an immune response and overactivation of the cytokine storm, with the more severe the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is isolated from CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, NLRP3 inflammatory activation in bats is defective.
By this logic, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general theme that gave rise to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Whereas bat beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While seals and other animals in markets have been seen harboring viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate nutrients to SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins may be one of the intermediate nutrients or that pangolin beta-CoVs may contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately created or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have come into the limelight due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the animal cells of HCoVs in zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
The prevalent evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are primarily bats and that transmission to humans is by intermediate nutrients.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by contact between humans and seals in markets, closing wet markets and killing seals there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, due to the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs that are quite close to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and how is yet to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into humpback camels for several decades.
These camels are an important means of transportation for the local people and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in wildlife.
In particular, bat CoVs with an anogenetic potential are very diverse.
It is likely that these zoonotic CoVs will undergo a process of evolution and recombination, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or lethal to humans in the future.
In some regions of China, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans must be devised.
In fact, many viruses have been present on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that aid in the spread of viruses, the likelihood of humans coming into contact with them and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated about staying away from bats.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for better understanding the ecology of CoVs and their natural nutrients which will prove useful in preventing animal to human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is for humans to stay away from the ecological habitats of natural cells of zoonotic viruses.
Many parts of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Second, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a real intermediate nutrient, it should be clarified how it interacts with different species including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
Whether it is bats, pangolins or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or their ancestral viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural nutrients in the future.
Continued investigation in this area will clarify the progressive evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with significant effects in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Consultation Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, and these guidelines provide our experience and appropriate context for fighting the pandemic worldwide.
Although Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" in accordance with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed Rapid Consultation Guidelines and which have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted considerable attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also being continuously updated.
For example, between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (NHC) issued a total of seven versions of the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) with fundamental changes in some contexts.
Now a commentary on our guidelines by Zhou et al. has been made, they have proposed a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also provided valuable references for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to perform a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, any one item of epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations, or three items of clinical manifestations if without a clear epidemiological history need to be completed:
Epidemic history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with features reflective of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or low lymphocyte in the early initial stage.
The diagnosis of the case made should be based on a suspected case with either one of the following pathogenic or serum evidence items: (1) a real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 comes back positive; (2) viral whole genome sequencing showing high homology to known novel coronaviruses; (3) a serum test coming back positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM immunoglobulins and IgG immunoglobulins; or a change of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG immunoglobulins from negative to positive, or a health benefit ≥ 4 times greater in the acute stage than in the inducible stage.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory system or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenicity of blood sample was added in fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added in seventh edition.
These revisions were based on the ongoing work of researchers who searched for an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory samples including blood samples, increasing the availability of various samples, and supporting bringing specific immune positive results to confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is much evidence that reminds us to be cautious with asymptomatic and symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The points system needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
As a conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that the latest guidelines of their home countries be identified and followed.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest single-day figure ever.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the number of reported cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh included 114 active cases and 33 people who had recovered from the disease while staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded so far.
In an online news briefing, Dr Mirzadi Sabrina Flora, Director of IEDCR, reported that four men and one woman had died.
According to Dr Mirzadi, two patients were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that the deceased was named Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, and was being treated at Kuwait Maitreya Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Ubaydul Qader, said road transport will be closed for a longer period of time than previously planned until next Saturday.
The public transport ban started on March 26 and was to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential items like medical supplies, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March in two people and the wife of one of them who returned from Italy.
On 19th March, all three were cured.
Worldwide, the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has crossed one million.
Data from Johns Hopkins University showed that on Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide crossed one million.
The coronavirus-caused disease COVID-19 is being linked to at least 52,000 deaths.
On the day this figure was crossed, the first coronavirus infection in Malawi and the first coronavirus death in Zambia were reported.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was among the few countries that were still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the WHO has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the twenty-four hours prior to 10 am (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
The US has recorded more than 2.44,000 cases of the coronavirus, and at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported that more than 1,000 deaths from coronavirus infection in the US on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will continue to receive salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the national emergency for 15 days; the said resolution was passed by 215 votes, with ten members absent and one voting against.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a 24-hour curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; previously the curfew was only from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dwayne announced that the state's stay-at-home order has been extended through May 1.
Stores in Australia have reduced the amount of toilet paper they can buy at a time.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at once in all their stores nationally to two and one package respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one - pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on check-out sites and on the series' Facebook pages.
It is reported that the buyers were shopping in pairs for the situation of need to self-isolate due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase limit of toilet paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
Prior to these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in its March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban, "many stores are already running out of stock within an hour of delivery", calling the demand unprecedented, while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a spokesperson for Woolworths, sales had "surged" last week.
Costco's Canberra store also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles placed orders for more large packages to suppliers and also increased the frequency of deliveries. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI raised stock to make the pre-scheduled Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers should try to increase stock but it is difficult to do so due to restrictions imposed by local councils on truck delivery times.
In a situation where suppliers are struggling to meet demand and the number of specials has already decreased, Russell expects production costs to increase.
On Tuesday ALDI announced that after the stock was released prematurely, some stores could not operate Wednesday specials.
In a report by News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores fill up every night.
He said that toilet paper is a heavy item and therefore there is no stock, and then, when the stock is sold, the back shelves are left empty, making the shortage even more severe.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, "Calls and Woolworths have the idea [that] if there were enough stuff on the shelf, and products like toilet paper and sanitizer could be [purchased] and available in large quantities, the commotion could probably be reduced".
Who Gives a Crap, a manufacturer of recycled toilet paper, said last Wednesday that it was out of stock.
According to a News.com.au report, Kimbirley-Clark, the maker of Cleanx toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, the maker of sorbent, insisted they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply.
In Melbourne, where fewer auctions are taking place than before due to holiday-taking buyers on the long Labor Day weekend, some property sellers are giving out free toilet paper to the first bidders in the auction, reported domain.com, a real estate site.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily published in Darwin, had an eight-page insert that was cut up and given away for use as toilet paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, stores were initially reluctant to ban; in this report they said they had no plans to ban shopping.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry items, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, a limit of two packs of 12-rolls was imposed on the purchase of Andres toilet paper at the online British supermarket Okado on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV-2, a global pandemic.
While the term "pandemic" refers only to the extent to which a disease spreads, not to the severity of its specific cases, WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
All countries can change the course of this global pandemic now.
If countries respond to this by detecting the disease, treating the patients, isolating them, tracking them and uniting them, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are extremely concerned both at the alarming level of spread and severity and at the alarming level of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "unprecedented".
In comments published by CNN in February, he said that "no respiratory virus has been detected from the ongoing global spread except influenza".
Gebraysis expressed something similar when he said, "We have not seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus until today".
He added, "And we have not seen a global pandemic that can be controlled at the same time".
The new global pandemic status follows a WHO ruling in January declaring the outbreak an internationally alarming public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "One in a hundred things, it's going to get worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths resulting.
201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Its outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive.Recommended preventive measures include: hand washing, covering your face when coughing, maintaining distance from other people and monitoring and self-isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has created severe global socio-economic disruption, prompted the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and caused widespread supply shortages due to panic shopping by people.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed on a nationwide or local basis, affecting about 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian origin and people of color, and others from areas with higher virus cases.
Reduced travel and heavy industry shutdowns have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (capital of Hubei Province), China reported mass cases of pneumonia from unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the Hunan seafood wholesale market and therefore the virus is thought to be of an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later found to be ill on 1 December 2019, and the person had no apparent links to the subsequent meat market group.
Two thirds of the initial batch of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be market related.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post reported that a case was a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that with a decrease in new cases in China, there has been a sudden spike in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very few cases may have been reported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Wallens, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and confirmed to have tested positive according to official protocol.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies not to test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial estimate of the baseline reproductive count (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people infected with COVID-19 recover.
In those who do not recover, the time from onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused the deaths of around 97,000 people.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to those who have died as confirmed positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing such as at home, nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the alleged death toll] has been underestimated", a statement supported by descriptive reports of low numbers in the US. Such underestimates occur frequently in epidemics, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy each.
As of 13 March, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health.The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as on 10th April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the death-to-case ratio has been estimated to have decreased from 17.3% (for those with onset of symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people diagnosed to die from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) to die from a disease.
These data are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized test of COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical study analyzing the impact of the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"On uncontrolled release, infectious outbreaks usually stabilize and begin to decline when nutrients are no longer available for the disease", said Mackie's Bonnie of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to make any reasonable predictions about when that will be".
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries follow WHO advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucherski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to remain circulating for one or two years".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine becomes available (possibly: 18 months or more)".
"I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, because it is very easily transmitted" and it can "turn into a seasonal disease, which returns every year", said William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University.
The severity of the return will depend on the extent of group immunity and mutation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be symptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include: fatigue, respiratory mucus production (cough), decreased sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhoea, diarrhoea or leprosy. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and blueness of the face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised when these symptoms occur. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be symptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that people in close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the alchemical ratio range from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell, initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly by small droplets produced during close contact and when coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that drops from coughing without a mouth covering can go from 4.5 m (15 ft) to 8. 2 m (27 ft).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets produced during speech that remain in the air for longer. Breath droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including when talking, although the virus is not usually airborne.
The droplets can go into the mouth or nose of those who are nearby or possibly into the lungs by breathing.
Some medical procedures such as tube insertion and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion to be vapourised and thus airborne spread.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it can spread through feces, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible in the pre- and post-symptomatic stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of laboratory confirmed symptomatic cases are present, but symptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person typically infects two to three other people.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for up to three days, on cardboard for up to one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can pass from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which disintegrates its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be an animal - generated virus.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically belonging to the group of betacoronavirus, subgenus sarbacovirus (genus B), with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in parts of genome sequences between pangolins from viruses and viruses from humans.
In the entire genome comparison so far, the common genetic content between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to provide intermediate nutrients to pangolins.
Provisional infection by the virus can be detected based on symptoms, although confirmation is eventually obtained from reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of infected secretions.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with many of its image characteristics being similar to other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to screen for or diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
The test is usually performed on the nasopharynx, but a throat swab can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect immunity.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has only been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories.
Symptomatic people's characteristic image features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pulmonary secretions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Because of similarities with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19 without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its use as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence based curved neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiography and CT.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and throwing that tissue directly into a trash can.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or advised all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where and how they became infected. Care providers caring for an infected person are recommended to take standard precautions, contact precautions, and protect eyes. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
Privacy concerns have been raised by the use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log proximity to a user's other cellphones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spreading about ways to prevent infection; for example, rubbing the nose and scratching with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although several organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent transmission of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after splashing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which bursts its protective bubbles.
In addition, the CDC recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be sterilized with a variety of solutions including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute of exposure to a disinfectant for a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at an office or facility such as a day care, all areas such as offices, toilets, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons, etc. should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cough or sneeze by covering their mouth and nose with an elbow or a cloth and then immediately dispose of any tissue.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the amount of droplets and distance to be covered from the breath when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene". Masks are also recommended for use by people who are caring for someone with the disease.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by ordinary people.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric.China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by normal healthy people, especially when they come into close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all persons entering the grocery store to wear face masks.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when going to public areas.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made it mandatory for passengers to wear face masks on trains and intercity buses on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks when going out, while it has also recommended making homemade face masks for those who cannot afford a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control activities aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Its methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can implement ways to create social distancing by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in the affected areas.
The maximum population recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and a weakened immune system are at higher risk of serious illness and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks.In late March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to make it clear that the purpose of social distancing is to minimize physical contact while maintaining either virtual or remote contact.
The use of the term "social distancing" has given rise to implications that, rather than encouraging people to stay in contact with others through alternative means, they should adopt complete social isolation.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to have sex only with the person living with you who has the virus or no symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for people diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have come into contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Quarantine is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to detect infected people as well as implement other infection control measures and vaccination to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to stop the spread of disease, efforts are shifted to mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
Both containment and mitigation measures can be combined at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so as to reverse the epidemic by reducing the original reproductive number to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is to try to reduce the epidemic's peak, known as reducing the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks and self-quarantine; community measures intended to create physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as cleaning surfaces.More stringent measures aimed at controlling the outbreak were introduced in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel restrictions.
Other countries also adopted a range of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass testing and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial assistance to infected people who self-quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased production of face masks and punished hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the US show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for acute healthcare by two thirds and deaths by half, but still hundreds of people die and health systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression can be a priority, but it needs to be maintained until the virus spreads to the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is earlier), otherwise transmission will return rapidly from lax measures.
Long-term interventions to suppress the pandemic generate social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids and resting can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can make the results worse.
Several compounds that are already approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building for the needs of COVID-19 patients and adapting healthcare has been described by WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The ECDC and WHO's European Regional Office have issued guidelines for the transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures wherever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are many opinions about where the first case (so - called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of animal origin. The pneumonia group of unknown cause was seen on 26 December and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to the "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumors and another doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
A significant number of cases of unknown pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in investigations starting in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year, as traffic and Wuhan became a transportation hub and major rail exchange.
On 20 January, China recorded around 140 new cases in a day, including two in Beijing and one person in Shenzhen.
As of 26 March, the US has surpassed China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, in-place shelter orders, or lockdowns) and curfews.As of April 2, approximately 300 million people in the U.S., or about 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, nearly 59 million people in South Africa are in lockdown, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later - almost a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.
Physician Zhang Jixian saw a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on December 26, after which his hospital notified Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
Following these reports, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police not to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a fierce campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was dubbed "the people's war" by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a siege zone was declared in Wuhan on 23 January to restrict movement, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (January 25) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
Authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshentsen Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leichensson Hospital, was later built to handle additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums into temporary hospitals.On 26 January, the government instituted additional measures to prevent the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.

Remote working measures were introduced in many Chinese areas.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Public movement was controlled in many cities, and it is estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction. After the outbreak reached its global stage in March, Chinese authorities took tough measures to prevent the virus from "coming in" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city.On 23 March, only one case was transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this instance via a traveller returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically halted and the outbreak in China is under control.
Travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, except Wuhan, on the same day two months after the lockdown was imposed.The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details on when this policy would end.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged the reopening of businesses and factories on 30 March and provided economic stimulus packages for businesses.The State Council declared a day of mourning beginning at 10:00 am on 4 April, with three minutes of national silence, which was timed to coincide with the Qingming Festival, although the central government asked families to pay online tributes while adhering to physical distancing to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
The outbreak of COVID-19 in South Korea from China was confirmed on 20 January 2020.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely linked to a crowd gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheoji devotees who came to Daegu from Wuhan were suspicious of the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 or about 13% of the 9,336 followers of the church reported symptoms.South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, over 2,000 confirmed cases were recorded in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected and therefore changed.The programme introduced by South Korea was considered the largest and best organised in the world for testing the population for the virus and isolating any infected people as well as tracking and quarantining contacts.
Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile applications, rapid testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities.South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming the government's mismanagement of the outbreak, or praised his response.

Iran allocated 5 trillion riyals to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to limit travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic continued between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Navroz.
Shia shrines in Qom were open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became the hub of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims of concealing the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases recorded by the Iranian government up to that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch also urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful protest and to provisionally release all eligible prisoners.

As of 5 April, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test those who had the virus by that time may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most lax of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for a perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to concerns faced by the public.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to avoid all non-essential travel and social contact, advising people to work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.

On 28 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control - the US government's premier public health institute - announced that they had developed their own testing kit.
Despite this, the US had a slow start in testing, making it difficult to understand the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The trial was hampered by defective test kits manufactured by the federal government in February, a lack of federal government approval for non-governmental test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals) by the end of February, and restrictive criteria (after which a doctor's order was required) for people to be eligible for a test by early March.

WHO has commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities in managing and containing the epidemic.
The WHO noted the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid fear ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Gallia commented that while "it was certainly not recommended by WHO", it was "a very important sign of a commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history". On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) after human-to-human transmission outside China was confirmed and the number of other cases increased, the sixth PHEIC since measures were first introduced during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the cause of PHEIC was "the risk of global spread, especially in low and middle income countries without strong health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason for such measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million for strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people infected with the virus, even if it was emerging".
Tedros further declared in statements, "We are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more later". On 11 February, WHO established COVID-19 as the name of the disease at a press conference.

This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared", insisting that the right response measures can help the world avoid "its worst".
Ryan further said that the current data did not convince public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human on Earth will be exposed to the virus".
On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The Director-General said WHO was "deeply concerned both by the dangerous level of spread and severity and the dangerous level of inactivity".

The Iranian government has been hit hard by the virus, with nearly two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other current or former political figures.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, saying his country was struggling to fight the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran.The outbreak has prompted calls for the US to adopt social policies similar to other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high-level funding for public health.

It has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which the WHO has warned will put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Daegu shoppers to sell Australian products in China.
This activity led to a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and high demand for food products in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, both regions are surviving extreme food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the stockpiling and smuggling of critical products have been successful, averting the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major drop in its critical agricultural output, but prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were also seen only temporarily in Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released stocks of sugar-meat to ensure adequate nutrition for the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to stockpile for such emergencies.

Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.The retail sector has been affected globally, with store hours reduced or temporarily closed.
In Europe and Latin America, visits to retailers have declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
The number of people walking to shopping malls in March decreased by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as increasing hygiene, installing thermal scanners to check shoppers' temperatures, and canceling gatherings. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who would not have been in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are stuck at home in inland provinces or in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the US and the unemployment rate could fall as much as 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Several million migrant workers have been made unemployed (paid through daily wages) due to the lockdown in India. A survey by the Angus Read Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for a universal credit scheme. About half a million companies in Germany have sent their workers to government-subsidized short-term work schemes called Kurzarbet.
The German Short - Term Work Compensation Scheme has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly affected by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organisations globally as well as individuals both employed and freelancing.
Organizations in the arts and culture sector endeavoured to maintain their (mostly publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, maintain the safety of their staff and the public and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions around the world and in various jurisdictions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, gatherings, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly growing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting gatherings, and other social gatherings, such as music festivals and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome, which take place during the final week of the Christian Lenten mourning session, have been cancelled.
Many bishop-diocese have recommended that elderly Christians stay home rather than attend mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
As the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome closed its churches and chapels and evacuated Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies also canceled services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras and limited public gatherings.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the outbreak-affected areas and subsequent closure of pilgrimage sites, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as civilians to the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events, including the 201920 UEFA Champions League, 201920 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 2019-20 NBA season, and 2019-20 NHL season have been cancelled or postponed.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be rescheduled "to a date beyond 2020 but not beyond summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments postponed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers adopting online methods, with many online gambling sites reporting significant increases in new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various music groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many large theatres like Broadway ones also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as creating live streaming of concerts or web-based "events" to showcase, distribute and promote the work of artists.
Online, many coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread in the form of humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been a growing bias, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and people with hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
In reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China), racist sentiments among Chinese people in various groups around the world have been documented about being worthy of receiving the virus or receiving just punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for Chinese people and people in the virus-affected areas.
Following the progress of the outbreak in new hotspot countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, may also experience suspicion and xenophobia.Citizens from countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan became popular on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the US have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus", which was deemed racist and anti-Chinese by critics.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sad.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, studying in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party state unit in West Bengal, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and "so God has taken vengeance on them".
The Chinese consulate in Kolkata later condemned the comment, calling it "false". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as targets for "foreign trash" and "disposal".
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and to detect the immunity produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Immunology can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunological tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in people.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among people as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities in how many have been tested across different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the mortality rate of reported cases, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), nasopharyngeal swabs can be tested on respiratory samples obtained by various methods including nasal mucus or mucus samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT - PCR testing with throat swabs is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
The virus may then disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected persons examined in the second week, alternatively the sample material can then be taken from the airways by suction catheter or the material (pulm) released in the cough can be used.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020, and formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed the test kit by 23 January 2020. South Korean company CognBiotech developed a diagnostic category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (Powercheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and specifically the RdRp gene found in SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit from China's National Medical Products Administration. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through International Reagent Resources.
Older versions of the test kit produced inconclusive results due to faulty reagents in one of the three genetic tests, and caused problems in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this caused the average number of samples successfully processed throughout February 2020 to be less than 100 samples per day.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28th February 2020 and till then State and Local Laboratories were not allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR based COVID-19 test nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics made COVID-19 testing available across the country as on 9th March 2020.
No quantity limits have been announced; collection and processing of samples should be done in accordance with the requirements of CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was notified to develop a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received approval from the FDA for a test that can be performed in high volume within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests being performed from one machine in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Similarly on 21 March 2020, Sheffield received EUA from the FDA for a check that takes approximately 45 minutes.
FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, this method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase production to 50,000 tests per day.A test kit using a monoclonal immunoassay that specifically binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that this rapid flu test can produce results in 15 to 20 minutes.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that chest radiography at an early stage has little clinical significance, while CT [computerized tomography] results may be available even before the onset of symptoms.
The distinctive features of CT include bilateral multilobular ground - glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, the effect of subplural, crazy paving and consolidation develops.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the current source point of the epidemic, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, despite being less specific, with many of the imaging characteristics similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a test or first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary testing.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect infection starting in individuals 7 days or so after onset of symptoms and to monitor people for infection. The tests can be done in central laboratories (CLTs) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Automated systems with high flow capacity in many diagnostic laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single sample of peripheral blood is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to see the immune response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from a skin puncture.
A first withdrawal step of testing different from PCR methods is not required.On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that provided information to the agency when needed and are thus now able to distribute their own immunoassays.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, EuroImmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitop Diagnostics received European approval for its test kits that can detect IgG and IgA immunity to the virus in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunity can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the immunity testing kits they purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong has a plan in which suspected patients can stay at home, the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube, they will spit in it and get the test result back in a short time.The British NHS announced that they are launching a plan to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to hospital or the risk of disinfecting a used ambulance.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory setting and performed 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the examination is ordered by the doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany's total capacity is 160,000 tests per week.
Drive-through checks were offered in many major cities till March 19.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey found that as of week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested and 33,491 (6.9%) samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 up to and including week 12/2020.In Israel, researchers at Technion & Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of combining samples and further testing samples from 64 patients simultaneously if the combined sample is found to be positive.In Wuhan, a temporary laboratory of 2000 square meters named "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was launched by BGI on 5 February 2020, which can process more than 10,000 samples in a day.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the model shows that if this testing capacity was not introduced, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the associated cost of dealing with quarantine would have been doubled.
The Wuhan laboratory has been immediately followed by Huo-Yen laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests every day. Multicast open source outlines have been released by Origami Essay that can test up to a maximum of 1122 patient samples of COVID19 using 93 tests. These balanced outlines can be run in small labs without the need for robotic liquid handlers.
Prior to March, reagent deficiencies and insufficient quantities posed a problem in large scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore sampling protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to free the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for coronavirus at a per capita rate than any other country, and was on track to increase testing levels to reach a larger population.
This was due to a combination of drive-through testing capabilities and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency testing labs in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory in the world outside China to operate on such a large scale.
Various screening methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted and sent the German method to low - income countries lacking resources to develop kits themselves.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the US. There were problems between China and the United States at the beginning of the outbreak over the reliability of testing kits and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet testing demand and recommendations by health experts.
On the contrary, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capability, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing testing programs is the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The widespread spread of the virus led to a surge in demand for testing that piled up thousands of outstanding tests in private U.S. laboratories and strained supplies of traps and chemical reagents.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its test kits.
In the United States, testing kits developed by the CDC were in short supply; the government then removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased testing kits from Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioiji Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm said that the wrong results could be due to failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that gave false test results and replace them with a second test kit made available by Shenzhen BioiG. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be dumped into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they were not used. The UK, which bought 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were not usable.
The quarantine of people who tested positive after testing and the detection of people who came in contact with people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 led to positive results.
In the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in the town of Vò, Italy, tested the entire population of about 3,400 people twice over an interval of about ten days.
Almost half of those with positive results had no symptoms, and all those with detected cases were quarantined.
The travel ban at the destination completely eliminated the new infections.
The 2020 coronavirus pandemic has been significantly slower in Singapore than in other developed countries, with aggressive contact detection, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home from 28 March, but reopened on time on 23 March after school holidays.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact detection, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with more tests than death numbers have much lower case mortality rates, possibly because these countries are better able to detect only mild or asymptomatic people.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the WHO's 16 reference laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the % of positive column in tests is affected by the country 's testing policy.
Similarly, a country where only hospitalized people are tested will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country where all citizens are tested, whether they have symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing dirt, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at some "essential moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and hay fever, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be washed with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who uses the toilet.
After you have splashed your nose, coughed or sneezed.
After touching animals, animal fodder, or animal waste.
Therapeutic hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to therapeutic procedures.
Hand washing before providing medication or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important activity for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the neonatal mortality rate in cases of home birth.
A 2013 study showed that good hand washing practices in children under five years of age may slightly improve their height gain.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting to wash hands with soap, can reduce infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Measures that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% reduction in cases of diarrhoea can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap as a self-induced behaviour in homes, schools and communities worldwide is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
A major ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated 18 million children dying each year.
About 35 lakh children die every year due to diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making a strong habit of hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or treatment, reducing the number of deaths from diarrhoea by about half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo which is spread through direct physical contact.
A minor harmful effect of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the transmission of disease through the fecal tract: after using the toilet (urine, stool), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after preparing food or consuming raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing techniques should be practiced to prevent transmission of disease are: before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing or spitting out your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing rates with soap are low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the US had the median rate with 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate with 23 percent.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large scale action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme is to brush teeth daily with fluoride, wash hands daily with soap, and have antifungal treatment twice a year.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin can be done better by mixing soap or detergent in water.
The main function of soap and detergent is to reduce the obstructions in the solution and increase the solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, do not dissolve easily in water.
However, adequate water flow helps in cleaning.
Solid soap may contain bacteria left over from previous uses due to repeated use.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the transfer is unlikely due to washing of bacteria with foam.
Yet according to the CDC, "soaps with a solution that allows liquid soap to be dropped on the palms without touching the hands are preferable".
The emphasis has been on antibacterial soaps for the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are advertised to be.
In addition to moisturizing and skin protecting agents, refined formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobially active benzoic acid, and other skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soaps, consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing trioxane, are as effective at preventing illness and removing bacteria from the hands.
Warm water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water for removing dirt and bacteria-containing natural oils.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer with a water - free base.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, rubbing alcohol waterless hand sanitizers (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) had begun to gain popularity.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which are formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or glycerin in a liquid or foam such as a moisturizer, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The combination of the strain of hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity further. Hand sanitizers containing 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi - drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and viruses.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (equivalent to 3.5 log reduction, 35 decibel reduction) and 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria after 1 minute of application (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or norwalk) type viruses, which are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and all finger holes are rubbed for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
Fingernails should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing both palms together. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when hands appear dirty.
The increasing use of these reagents is based on their ease of use and rapid antimicrobial activity; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol - based hand sanitizer can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/ or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The desiccating effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/ or other lubricants to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizer with lubricant significantly reduced skin irritation and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial scrubbers.
Contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity are rare allergens to additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs.
The lower tendency to induce irritating contact dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water became a draw.
Despite their effectiveness, the waterless reagents do not clean organic matter by hand, but simply disinfect it.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, as pathogens still remain on hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on ingredients and formulation, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce efficacy after repeated use due to potentially progressive adverse skin reactions, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application.
Many people in low income communities cannot afford soap and use ash or clay instead.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
WHO has recommended ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper handwashing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended as basins with standing water can be contaminated, although the water temperature does not matter.
Foam the hands with the right amount of soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap instead of water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer will release more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Washing hands in the basin can re - contaminate them.
Dry with a clean towel or let air dry.
Wet and damp hands are more easily re - contaminated. The most commonly missed areas are the thumb, wrist, area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and sticky nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage which can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap are not available, if necessary, various low cost options can be created to facilitate hand washing, for example by pouring water from a hanging basin or a basin with suitable holes and/or using ash. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water conservation solutions are available, such as "tip-tap" and other low cost options.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique in which a leg - operated lever, used to hang a jug by a rope, and a small amount of water, is poured on the hands and soapsticks.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
Large amounts of research show that paper towels provide greater hygiene than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the Paper Towel Industry The European Tissue Symposium, which aimed to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and cutting-edge jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on finger pads and 254% on palms.
Drying with jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on finger pads and 15% on palms.
After hand washing and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average by 76% on finger pads and by 77% on palms. The scientists also conducted tests to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in cross-contamination potential of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which extracts air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing microorganisms from the hands and unit and possibly contaminating other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
The use of hot air hand dryers spread microorganisms up to 0. 25 m from the dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes in the count of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel dryers.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer wipes is an option in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol - based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after the discovery of its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital environment (1846) by Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff about washing their hands if they forget.
One study found that their use reduced infection rates.
Therapeutically, hands are washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, using a foaming agent using an appropriate amount of soap and water or gel and rubbing each part of the hands.
The fingers of both hands should be interlaced and rubbed.
If there is debris under the nails, a brush with a hard bristle can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on hands, it is important to wash them well and wipe them with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any outlet doors should be opened if necessary).
It prevents the hands from being contaminated again from those surfaces.
Hand washing in health care system is aimed at eliminating pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and preventing their transmission.
According to The New England Journal of Medicine, hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, which leads to transmission of microorganisms.
One study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a brochure demonstrating standard hand-washing and hand-rubbing in healthcare settings.
The manual guidance on hand hygiene available by this organisation can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and certify hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has defined "five occasions" for hand washing:
After contact with blood / body fluids
before disinfecting, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap) gives the hand washing agent a lethal effect.
Such lethal capacity may be desired before surgery or in a setting where antibiotic resistant organisms are extremely widespread. To 'rub' your hands for surgical tearing, it is necessary to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, disinfected towels to dry hands after washing, and a disinfected brush for cleaning the rub and another disinfected means for cleaning under the nails.
All jewellery should be removed.
The procedure usually requires washing the wrists up to the elbow for 2 - 6 minutes.
No need to rub for long time (10 minutes).
When washing, the water on the wrists should be prevented from coming back to the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a disinfected cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene came from 20% before washing, and little additional benefit was obtained when hand cleaning frequency was increased by more than 35%.
Hand washing with plain soap increases the transmission rate of bacterial infectious disease by more than three times compared to washing with antibacterial soap. When hand rubbing with an alcohol based solution was compared with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 minutes, it was found that rubbing with alcohol reduced the contamination of bacteria by 26% more than with a simple bacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs at reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores from hands.Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating employees on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and providing written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different healthcare systems.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an affordable, essential means of achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, achieving universal handwashing behaviour is a challenge due to the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces.
For example, in most rural Africa, handwashing faucets are scarce near every private or public toilet, even though cheap alternatives to building handwashing stations exist.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to the habits that are put in place rather than due to lack of soap or water.
Encouragement and support for handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and bring about changes in long-term behaviour of the population.
For it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social awareness campaigns are less effective. An example of hand washing promotion in schools is the "Three Star Method" by UNICEF which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can go from one to three stars respectively.
Building hand washing stations can be part of hand washing promotion campaigns to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about a change in behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of DALYs.
However, one review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health - especially people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth or in wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, an Englishman who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people believed that infections were caused by a bad smell called miasma.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "Right hand washing techniques" were hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and office buildings and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands of something" means to declare your unwillingness to assume responsibility or to be complicit in it.
It originates from the Matthew chapter of the Bible where Pontius Pilate distanced himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with very wide usage in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clear a fictional stain that reflects her guilty conscience about the crimes she committed and her husband's motivation to commit the crime.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, and place more importance on handwashing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such meditation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" complementary activities such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapless water for hand washing is a part of the ritual hand washing described in many religions, including the Baha'i Faith, Hinduism, Tevilah and Netilat Yadaim in Judaism, Lavo in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing to provide hygiene after certain actions in particular.
Hand washing after using a toilet is mandatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash hands before and after every meal.
Control of risks of COVID-19 infection in the workplace
The control of risks of COVID-19 infection in the workplace, for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are the application of occupational safety and health procedures for risk controls.
Proper control of the risk of disease spread at workplace depends on the workplace and the work performed, which is based on risk assessment of contact sources, severity of disease in the community, and risk factors of individual workers who are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with people and other colleagues, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, observing respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate-risk contact jobs are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes those workers who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population - density work environments, and some high - volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include: contact with high-efficiency air filters, use of sneezing guard, and maintaining personal protective equipment available for the situation if a COVID-19 infected person is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and morgue workers to be at high contact risk who come into contact with a COVID-19 infected or suspected person, and this risk increases to become a high contact risk if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures on, collect or handle samples from, a COVID-19 infected or suspected person.
Hazard controls suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure communication chamber and work - appropriate personal protective equipment.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have many effects within the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible contact.
The nature of trade can change in relation to both what goods are in demand and the means of obtaining these goods (such as during times of low demand or purchases through delivery or on the move services).
Finally, the movement of goods from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparedness and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
The plans address the different levels of risk associated with workplaces and job functions, including risk sources, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and risk factors of individual personnel such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the controls needed to address the risks and contingency plans for the situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparedness and response plans for infectious disease may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses that are adopted.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure widely used to group hazard controls according to their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and this may be the most cost effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is the change in work policy or procedures that requires action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
Personnel should be advised to select all types of PPE based on risk, to wear them appropriately (e.g., respirators), to wear them frequently and properly, to inspect them regularly, to maintain and replace them as needed, and to remove, clean and store them properly or dispose of them to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with people and other colleagues.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include: frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are ill, providing respiratory etiquette covering coughs and sneezes, tissue and garbage containers, preparing remote or parasitic shifts if necessary, discouraging employees from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons in the workplace is an important step to protect personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home as long as they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medications, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk jobs include jobs that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) with people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include personnel who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high volume sales arrangements. Engineering controls for this and high-risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing communication rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneezing guards, and installing drive-through windows for customer service. Administrative controls for this and high-risk groups include encouraging sick personnel to stay home, replacing face-to-face communication with virtual communication tents, establishing separate staff, preventing unnecessary travel to places with ongoing COVID-19 outbreaks, providing emergency communication platforms that address concerns about staff use of washing machines, providing a mandatory workplace environment for employees to use washing machines, providing customers with the latest in personal protective equipment, training and training, including the use of face masks or protective equipment, and providing personal protective equipment to reduce exposure to COVID-19 while providing customers with the latest in face-to-face contact and/or protective measures, such as face masks and protective gear.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect the crew and other passengers include: keeping the sick person at a distance of 6 feet from others, designating a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue if he or she coughs or sneezes.
Crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for an ill passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and additional personal protective equipment should be worn if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other consumables should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls require postponing travel if sick and self-isolation and immediately informing the onboard medical center if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be performed in the quarantined person's room.For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closures for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person has been in a school building, regardless of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as cancelling meals in physical education or singing classes or restaurants, increasing distance between desks, balancing arrival and departure times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies.For law enforcement personnel performing daily law enforcement activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact persons confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during catching, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment using household cleaning spray or wipes before reusing, and follow standard operating procedures for the isolation and disposal of used PPE and for the isolation and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health care and mortuary workers to be in high or ultra - high categories of contact risk.
High-risk contact jobs include providing healthcare, assisting, laboratory and medical transportation personnel who come into contact with known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
These become very high contact risk if personnel perform aerosol generating procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, collect or handle samples from them.
Aerosol generating procedures include tube penetration, cuff induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or sample collection from tearing.
High-risk contact morgue operations involve people who prepare the bodies of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; if they perform autopsies they become very high-risk contact. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during the performance of aerosol generating procedures.
Specific negative pressure communication may be appropriate in some health care and morgue settings.
Samples should be handled with biosecurity level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in separate waiting areas.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the US, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering face mask respirators or better should be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve worker comfort.WHO does not recommend covers, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at entry point.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles face shield, chonga and gloves.
If an aerosol generating procedure is performed, surgical masks are replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the global supply of PPE is inadequate, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, reducing physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE needed for a specific task, using the same respirator without removing it during care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for allergic persons.

This month we have extraordinary circumstances all around us.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear the interconnectedness of all human beings in the world and our responsibilities to one another.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community enhancement, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of friendship we have seen among all our colleagues on emails, calls and chats is an extraordinary testament to how many extraordinary people we have been privileged to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as colleagues that I cannot express in words.
Last week, a person shared with me his praise of our work.
It reminded me of how meaningful it is that the world is turning to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful a symbol it is of keeping this very important resource online and available to all.
It's your work that makes this possible, whether you're running sites or providing payroll for our colleagues or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, and it needs it now more than ever.
This is a moment when our work, and the way we do it, will both have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission, and your role in it, we are going to make some significant changes to the way we work with you this coming week.
We were able to work together in the ministry.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C-Team met last night to discuss our methodology and to develop a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what would be the appropriate response in our minds to the situation we were facing, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve tension and support our mission for the long term.
If you have to cut back on your work, there is nothing wrong with that.
For all staff, contractors, and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work beyond normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and whether you are caring for your loved ones, bringing groceries, or going to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not counting your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It doesn 't have to be said, but we are saying it.
No need for sick leave or PTO - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main areas of work are looked after by someone.
(If you are confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can assist you and ensure that your situation is appropriately addressed by management.)
Hourly employees will get full salary.
We have already said, and we reaffirm our commitment to deliver on our promises to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone shall receive a salary on the basis of his normal working hours during normal circumstances.
You will get paid even if you are sick and cannot work.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to escape the stress of the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially in times like these.
Again, taking care of yourself is the most important thing.
We say you talk to your manager, so we know what to expect, and then we can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we cannot let stand.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security, and Fundraising Teams (and others) perform critical tasks that may require additional collaboration.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus our focus on collaborating on the things that are essential to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we will all just focus on the most essential projects.
If we slow down now, we will avoid injury later.
We have no plans to give double the time to recovery after the global pandemic passes.
You will no longer be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are beyond reality.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about APP?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we want to revise the timeline for completing our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to give us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their most important work, taking care of themselves, and taking care of loved ones, and to accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of the deadline will significantly reduce our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the Board of Directors next week and as soon as we have confirmation we will inform the delegates and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office location, contacts, and cleanliness
Last week we learned that a colleague of ours based in SF may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we deployed anti-viral cleaning crews to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface, lobby, and elevator bank that came to our floor with hospital-grade antiviral solution.
The building is implementing its own care - duty protocol using products that assist the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be fully ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office had adopted a fully remote system in line with the guidance shared from San Francisco.
As some of our NYC colleagues know, there is also talk of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/remote for the first time.
Our long-time colleagues working from home/remote know that this will require adjustments, and they would like to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to increments of one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are necessary, consider splitting them up into several days.
Clearly define meetings, have an agenda, and send out reading material in advance.
Make video your default option with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and integration.
Take the initiative to facilitate each meeting, with one person monitoring the chat for questions and keeping track of the speaker list, and one person helping to take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
If you need a comfortable headset, email tech support.
Use your health reimbursement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring webinar-based labour efficiency guidance to support the growth of distributed work across the foundation.
This past week we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the Editaathon, until the WHO declares the end of the global pandemic.
We informed them that we understand that our request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their mutually agreed grant activities, and that no one will be penalized for being forced to delay or modify those targets.
In the coming week we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimedia and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The global community as a whole is saddened by this obstacle, but also relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and elsewhere.
Going forward, CRT is working to organize a page on the Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a place for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to your calendars for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in these situations and are there to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email on the Office Wiki, and all other necessary COVID-19 related information.
CRT will keep these pages updated and keep all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in the most significantly affected countries at this time.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a major workflow, or coverage challenge, or you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform and work with the CRT.
We are there to provide support and help establish relationships as needed.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please email Brian Judden, Director of Global Operations, HR International.
None of these changes should be seen as a renunciation of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our tasks and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways we have never done in the past.
We believe these steps are necessary to help each other, so that we can continue to act, provide our activities with the support they need, and continue to provide the service the world depends on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be waiting for us.
Right now, it's time to help each other, and make room for the important work that's coming in the coming weeks and possibly the coming months.
To make this possible, we need all of you, and so we want you all to take care of yourselves and your families, so that when you need it, you can be your best.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The team was led by the former President of the Board of Directors, Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jamie V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jamie V, Janine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 is a zinc - containing metaloenzyme located on the interlayer and surface of other cells.
ACE2 protein has an N - terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C - terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-crossing type I membrane protein with an unabsorbed enzymatically active domain on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is broken down from the membrane domain by another enzyme called shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of lung type II air cells, small intestinal enterocytes, interstitial cells of arteries and veins and arterial soft muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the prefrontal cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE countercharge.
ACE breaks down the angiotensin I hormone into the vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes carboxyl - terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - Phe) and hydrodegradates it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H - Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9] can also break down many other peptides including bradykinin, epelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been reported to play a role in heart failure.
As a membrane protein, it serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including ACE2, HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the contact S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells leads to endocytosis and transfer of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the S protein to be induced by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to hypothesize that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to controls".
Also, "The risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in those with trauma and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less pronounced than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
In humans, the half-life of rhACE2 is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a 24-hour sequence of action (duration).
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II increases. Distilled rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying individuals ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some regions and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for building contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially regarding systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
The low-interval option involves using a Bluetooth signal to log a user's proximity to another cellphone.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality directly into their Android and iOS operating systems to support such Bluetooth-based apps.
In China, the Chinese government has deployed an app in conjunction with Alipay, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to detect contact with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was at an advanced stage of development, and would be available for planning within weeks.A similar app ("StopCovid") has also been deployed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering Singapore's TraceTogether app and apps based on the BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they don't leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positive cases and a potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the type of organizations that can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement for limits on such surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions on government projects:
The surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
There should be an end section for supervision and extensions of supervision;
Data use should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be preserved and shown to be protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid promoting discrimination and disenfranchisement;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to and abuse abuse;
"Meaningful participation" will be required by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and unauthorized groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to solve the problem of continuous monitoring by removing tracing mechanisms from their device operating systems when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; many privacy-protecting systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to do contact tracing in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Several countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As on 6th April 2020, these details had not been released yet.
Privacy-protecting contact tracing is a well-established concept with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log proximity to a user's other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort involving both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes decentralized privacy-protecting proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocol and mechanism for mobile contact tracing (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matches take place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-protecting techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by privacy technology developer Enigma MPC, which was originally set up at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was established by groups that were organized in terms of essentially similar approaches and largely similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global inter-operability of tracing and warning apps, which was a key aspect of achieving broad adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
He also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three phases:
Providing tools to enable governments to create official privacy-protecting coronavirus tracing apps.
This functionality is directly integrated into iOS and Android
Drug re-use (also known as drug re-purposing, re - profiling, re - designation or therapeutic change) is the re - use of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transplants related to health benefits. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides a suitable project to develop an effective antiviral drug to protect against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include Pappan-like proteases, RNA dependent RNA polymerases, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain et al. studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized and analyzed for structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a preclinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used to protect against certain autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquyl phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trials process and is authorized under EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine preventive use.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir to be "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative at an average of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half omiphenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very limited and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy medicines from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver medicines to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of a combination of the antiviral lopinavir and ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir (Calatra), concluded that "no benefit was seen".
The drugs were designed to prevent HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There is criticism within the scientific community about directing resources to the reuse of drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included Lopinavir/Ritonavir in the International Solidarity Trial.
Remdesivir was manufactured and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had artificial ambient antiviral activity to protect against several phyllo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some preliminary pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials conducted by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with moderate disease and the other for people with more severe disease.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (in China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (in Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) of Japan is planning a clinical trial for the treatment of patients infected with the novel coronavirus with pre-symptomatic status, with an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, Tegenis alvesco (cyclozoin).
A phase II trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients admitted from severe, hospitalized cases to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anti-scandals are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study of 300 patients researching the use of anoxaparin sodium at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on the re-purposing of approved antiviral drugs, which were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to the Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potential reusable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tosilzumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also testing in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a conceived vaccine for protection against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to be available in less than 18 months to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
As reported in April, the essentials of CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large scale planning and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
The advanced key platform objectives in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 total vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others have been announced, but little public information is available (under design or envisaged in planning).
A Phase I - II trial involves initial safety and immunity tests, usually conducted at random, placebo - controlled and multiple sites, determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group monitoring adverse effects at optimal doses, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine for disease prevention.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
Around 24 January 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre at the University of Saskatchewan (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it was starting work on a vaccine with the aim of starting human trials in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26th January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28th January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, the Yanshen Pharmaceutical Company led by Haneke Shutemaker announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop a vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, Laboratory Oncogen in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technique used for cancer neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, a Genrex subsidiary, NuGenrex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it is launching a vaccine project to develop a ly-key peptide vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Western Maryland both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was involved in the development and manufacture of the vaccine.
Novavax will work with Novavax Inc.
The partners announced plans for preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it is working with 11 isolators, and that it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on a fast track.
On 12 March 2020, MedicaGo, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is in laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered Kurvak "a large sum for the exclusive acquisition of a COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government objected to.
On 17 March 2020, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162, is currently in preclinical trials, with clinical trials expected to commence in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Tacis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that they would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and could start trials on their final vaccine candidate by the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research association, which includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Biosciences (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which invests a total of US$29 million of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine development.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal trials of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
This vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures to protect against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as MedicaGo and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically, with plans to set up a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of other coronavirus outbreaks.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were apparently initiated 2 weeks after vaccination".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies to protect against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources for learning from IBM to supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits in addition to the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking for 4,170 healthcare workers to be recruited.
It is possible that vaccines will not be safe or effective in development.
Early research assessing the effectiveness of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicates the need for biosecurity level 3 containment measures to deal with live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection against SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection against MERS.
When MERS was widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments to protect against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, all of which are viral-vectored vaccines, two are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases are mild, some cases develop viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during close contact, often through small droplets generated by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are generated when exhaling, they usually fall to the ground or surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a dirty surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharynx.
Masks are recommended for people who are suspected to be infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others making their use mandatory.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up and blueness of face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastric symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, only chest tightness and rapid heartbeat were initially observed.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure and death.
This is called the emergence period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but it can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of individuals who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected individuals develop symptoms.
The role of these symptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases were symptomatic during their hospital stay.
China's National Health Commission began including symptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; 130 (78%) of 166 infections that day were symptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can contain large amounts of the virus.
Talking out loud produces more droplets than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can produce droplets up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as catheter penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause aerosols to form from respiratory secretions and thus airborne diffusion.
Although there are concerns that it can spread through feces, the risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although transmission is possible before symptoms emerge, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person typically infects two to three other people.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for four hours on 99% copper.
Even so, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap products deactivate the fatty protective layer of viruses by breaking them down, as well as freeing them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral dose, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral dose on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks down its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most affected organs by COVID-19 as the virus reaches the nourishing cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in lung type II air cell.
The virus uses a special superficial glycoprotein called "peplomer" to bind to ACE2 and enter the nourishing cell.
Acute cardiac damage was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor prognosis.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 have found radiation-induced air cell damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-induced inflammatory foreign matter within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a follow-up for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secretory T-cells were shown to correlate with selection of inflammatory IL-6-secretory monocytes in COVID-19 patients and severe lung disease.
Lymphocytic foreign matter has also been reported in the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for this disease.
The standard test method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT - PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained from a nasopharyngeal duct; however, a nasal duct or mucus sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples taken at two week intervals and the immediate value of the results is low.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been previously infected) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that the purity is only 60 to 70 per cent.
In the US, the FDA approved the first-care-of-the-place test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral polygonal ground - glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in early transition.
Subplural dominance, crazy pavement (thickening of the walls with variable air cell fillers), and condensation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on the microscopic lesions and disease physiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings obtained from autopsy are:
Macroscopy: Inflammation of the pulmonary lining, pericarditis, thickening of the lungs and pulmonary swelling
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary swelling, pneumocyte overgrowth, large amorphous pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic intersperm and polycentric giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: Radiated air cell damage (DAD) with radiated air leakage.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: Management of leakages and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis in the airways
Blood: circulating intravascular scarring (DIC); leukoarythroplastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face covering in public settings to limit transmission by partially symptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce exposure of infected individuals to large groups, by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no known drug to be effective in preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is to try to slow the peak of the pandemic, which is called "cutting the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating and after splashing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
In addition, it recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is generated from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help kill bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand immunization".
Glycerol is mixed as a moisturizer.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include providing fluid therapy, oxygen support and other support to affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under discussion.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Adjuvant therapy may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into one free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings, when performing aerosol generating procedures such as tube penetration or hand convection.
For healthcare workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping the person in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE bag, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial systems, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against a specific biological reagent is not guaranteed for non-approved uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe that they require mechanical communication or other options, but in a few percent of cases they are.
A type of respiratory aid for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized people, with some evidence that ductal penetration with high flow nasal passage or bi-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether either of these offers the same benefits to critically ill people is not known.
Some physicians prefer to use intramuscular mechanical communication when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal penetration. Severe cases are most common in older adults (over 60 years of age and especially over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of sufficiently severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical assistance for communication, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have eventually been admitted to ICU.
Mechanical communication becomes more complicated as COVID-19 develops acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygen delivery becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilator-connected ventilators are required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of lung damage and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in progressive trials.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments.The FDA has provisionally allowed health-benefiting plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is in serious or immediate danger.
It has not been subjected to the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
China launched a mobile app in February 2020 to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect potential risk of infection by detecting 'close contacts' using surveillance data.
Each user can also see the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities.Big data analytics for cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they came into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to trace mobile phone data of people suspected of coronavirus.
This measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect people coming into contact with infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared joint phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, the German federal government agency for preventing the spread of the virus and research.
Russia employed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Julio Galera said he was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for constructive solutions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience crisis from fear of quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or self infection.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "The increasing social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm to damage people's mental health and wellbeing".
The disease may have a mild course with or without some symptoms similar to other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or very severe illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but data are lacking for COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, pulmonary trauma or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include acute appendicitis, abnormal scarring and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scandalous abnormalities, especially an increase in prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, of which five days were spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of early cases, the average time from displaying initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Tissue pathology tests of autopsy lung samples show radiation air cell damage with cellular fibromycoside leaks in both lungs.
Viral - causing cellular pathological changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs appeared similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, cardiac damage was noted by high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March of America data, 89% of people hospitalized had pre-existing conditions.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic status of a region can also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality by condition also vary due to those regional differences and due to system related difficulties.
The low count of mild cases may lead to higher mortality rates.
However, the fact that the deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 than nonsmokers and were about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die. Concerns have been expressed about the long-term pathological symptoms of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decline in lung capacity of 20% to 30% in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans showed organ damage.
It can also cause post - recovery intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections provide effective and long-lasting immunity in people recovering from the disease.
Immunity is seen as possible based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for the coronavirus have been reported at a date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be the worst of an unhealed infection rather than a re - infection.
The virus is considered to be of natural and animal origin spreading through infection from animals to humans.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely by human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was given as 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease code U07.2 for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the global death-case ratio as on 17th April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and infection mortality rate (IFR) which represents the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These data are not time-bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop immunity, the presence of an immune system can provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the centre of the outbreak in Italy, in Castelliglione d'Adra, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Ganglet, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, leading to relatively low mortality rates, and all COVID-19 deaths may not have been formally classified.
Besides, the German health system is not extreme.
In the Netherlands, as assessed from blood donors, about 3% may be immune.
69 (0.004% of population) deaths have been confirmed from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate varies for men and women.
Studies in China and Italy have shown higher mortality rates among men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only narrowed at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this gender gap are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at a younger age than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease, and 19 stands for the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), animal species or group of people, which are in line with international recommendations for naming with the aim of preventing derogatory references.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory illness, which complies with 2015 guidelines not to use spaces in disease and virus names.
The formal names for COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health materials such as nasal spray and parts for ventilators.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilation valves, and the supplier was unable to provide within the required timeframe, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a "solidarity trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hopes of effectiveness.
No vaccine is available at present, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being tested.
First, the researchers aim to develop a complete viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactivated or dead, aims to induce a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, the subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system sensitive to certain sub-components of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-contact protein that helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technology for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies will need to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the disease-causing virus.Antibody-dependent growth has been reported as a potential challenge to vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Most Chinese research is working on reusable antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries, due to be notified by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are being evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the efficacy of remdecivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with unapproved use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with initial results.
However, there have been calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice that dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umiphenovir for use to protect against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required for the suppression of artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2.
Nitasoxanide has been recommended for further study in organisms after demonstrating low concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early contact protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
There are major limitations to studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin, which have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study.Oszltamyvir does not inhibit artificial ambient SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in COVID-19 treatment.
Increased cytokine levels can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties. Toquilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a nationwide Phase 2 non-randomised trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify elevated cytokine levels, it aims to counteract such elevations, which are thought to cause death in some affected people.
Interleukin-6 inhibitors were approved by the FDA in 2017, based on retrospective case studies, for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilisumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring pure and concentrated immunes produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy may mediate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms of action, such as antibody - dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using synthetic monoclonal immunity, are in development.
The production of health beneficial serums, which contain the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and have specific immunity to this virus, can be increased for faster planning.
