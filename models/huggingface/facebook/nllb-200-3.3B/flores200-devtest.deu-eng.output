Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's already widely accepted, but it also provides details that fossils generally can't, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on the upper surface and light or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed limb called the rachis, but other features of feathers - hooks and barbels - the researchers concluded that the rachis were likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature control or for display. The researchers suspected that the specimen, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, shows the feathers of an adult and not the down of a cuckoo.
The researchers claimed that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the plumage of an adult and no quincunicons.
A car bomb exploded in the police headquarters of the Turkish city of Gaziantep yesterday morning, killing two policemen and wounding more than twenty others.

To determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma current, the luminous force and rotation are taken together.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic field reversals.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper with the candidate of their choice on it in an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law is quite strict.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are being dropped except those of the voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process, and in the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were hurt.
The driver, however, suffered significant head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue services were rescuing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, meanwhile, has been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court for the murder of her son.
She is being held in custody pending charges and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be falsified as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts have found the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: 'Journalists seem to cross a dangerous line when they publish photos and so on of suspects.'
The Crown Office, which is in charge of prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the prosecution is brought.
According to Demak, the document refers to the border dispute, in which the Palestinians demand a return of the borders to the state prior to the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other subjects purportedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
The Palestinian Authority, on the other hand, wants to accept such a presence for only five years.
The guards of the accompanying plague control experiment should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instruction.
Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of the package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The occasion for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
There have been over 60 reported cases of overheating on defective iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
"Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as 'not serious'".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and there are at least six confirmed deaths so far.
Six hostages, including the children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a medical career.
He trained as a midwife and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone accelerated the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "Black Box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna as well.
"Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna was the first queen of the extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, very unique, just like her, a strong woman.'"
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented: "Luna was just as crazy as I am...maybe even crazier...I love her and will miss her...hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposing Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those polled said that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three-way relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned because of his many ailments.
He was unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain, as it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous individuals confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of Earth's water supply, along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Since comets collided with the earth long ago, scientists are hoping to gain insight into how planets, especially the earth, form.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
There is speculation that he may run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of the older technology based on ground radar to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be provided and the above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley.
With concern over lack of transport options, the likelihood grew that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process took much longer due to mating between a native Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into many different shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided, hammered, or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted pictures, called pictorial manuscripts, in books, called pictorial manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use red coal juice to make an indicator.
The cabbage juice changes its color according to how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (because hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels weird and forms a kind of protective layer.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the homes of Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China also had toilets, and in Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled in society.
If you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and then reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use space-based telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a gigantic rocket over 100 feet high to launch a satellite or a telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest service that the bicycle has done for us is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It has brought us the railway, the automobile and many other means of transportation.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of the niche, a special job that every cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar does not sound like the lion's full-blown roar, but more like a phrase of growled words.
Ocelots eat small animals, and when they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals the ozelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate prey animals, sniffing out where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision in the dark and can move around unnoticed, and they hunt their prey by visually adapting to their surroundings and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (e.g. when they move across a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and then it looks less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations look so different that they can no longer be assigned to the same species.
This process we call speciation, which is simply the emergence of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants produce their food by the sun through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants, and we make our clothing from plants, and we feed primarily on plants, and without plants, animals cannot survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other Mosasaurians.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set of teeth at the palate, meaning there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have had a forked tongue, and it could have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and maybe even been a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that came into the water, and even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While much of their food may be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the grasshopper.
Another difference was that the poor people and the women ate their food sitting on chairs, whereas the rich men preferred to have communal banquets where they lay on their side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes could not contain the foods that would later be brought to Europe from America or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Sacrifices were offered to the gods, and the priests tried to please the gods by ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner altar room that was reserved for the priestly class.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zikkurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. The shops consisted of little shops facing the street. The houses were built with stone.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the cost of timber was extremely high.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Old Norse legend says that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and that when he travelled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were living there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "The Legacy of the Knights Templar", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map drawn on it.
Although the back of the piece has a text, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping early in its life.
So it's possible that the notation was just added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
"It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them".
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and French liberation forces had liberated the south of France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state and also somehow defines the size of a society.
City states are the forerunners of nations, and a civilized culture implies the passing of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognised as full-fledged civilizations.
During the revolutionary struggles, the 13 states formed a weak central government, consisting only of the Congress, on the basis of the federal treaty.
Congress had no authority to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state agencies to enforce all its laws, which often failed to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to override tax and customs laws between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, together with the German national football team, the second most successful in the world and was 2006 FIFA World Champion.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One motor sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
"Because of the clusters/groups of islands that make up Japan, Japan is often referred to geographically as an 'Archipelago.'"
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European seafarers passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a branch in southwestern Taiwan, thus initiating a change in the native grain cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the Qing Dynasty's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is mainly composed of three structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better impression of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the predominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its image format has been taken over by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
In fact, the so-called 35 mm format is confusingly 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often-derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates momentum while maintaining a degree of order in an image.
It says that the intersection of the lines that bisect a picture vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the enriched and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held European nations together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipotence ruled over everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the most important Christian beliefs is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that is precisely why churches have funds.
The centrality of the church in Rome for over a thousand years has caused many to question whether this principle has been met.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade was in violation of generally accepted international law, codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of the sea, even posing a danger to neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the horrors of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a position with the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents in his possession, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique method of indicating different eras, and each time period in China and each family that was in power was its own dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms Era, which took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the supreme throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, like the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the land belongs to the people and not to one ruler alone.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, so that the most ambitious and the best could succeed.
The same was true in the military, because instead of class, the ranks in the army were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very much interested in things that went beyond this everyday life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has survived the ages, providing a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists, because once you're in the cave, you're completely isolated.
You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world is seen or heard.
The Great Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Pyramid of Cheops is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Cheops' wives and family members.
The symbol upstrike looks like a V and the symbol upstrike looks like a bracket or a square with the lower line missing.
Up means you start at the top and you should push the bow down means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and you pull the bow.
The sound of the strumming is usually softer, while the strumming is more forceful and expressive.
You may add your own pencil markings, but remember that the printed arrow markings are there for musical reasons, and should be respected in the normal course of events.
King Louis XIV, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789, in Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people who were making threats against the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the angry mob shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover the bulk of the expenditure, and the interest on bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits that came from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, an era in European history that spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which coincidentally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide spectrum of ideas in practice, from the technology push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: on the one hand, that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and on the other hand, that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
It can be said, for example, that the passenger car inevitably brings with it the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The increased car ownership is also leading to an increase in road accidents, which in turn is leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a strong, culturally deterministic element, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantics, it is the geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures arose with reference to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, due mainly to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offer of the Byzantine markets.
It was also at this time that the title of the world's fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
In the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the East.
However, the styles in the West are lagging behind by 25 to 30 years because of the slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe slowly began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the period was that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to secure clothing.
A consumer economy is an agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological, farming method that saves, uses local seeds in the ecoregion and combines them with alternative farming or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
In the past, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and in many developing countries this is still the case.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by societal norms and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished from others by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as such may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation by a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes fashions, customs, and jargon.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse during their childhood, were not socialized by adults.
"Such children are called 'wild' or 'wild.' Some of the children who have been so called have been held captive by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child has been due to the inability of the parents to accept the child's considerable intellectual or physical limitations".
Wolf children may have experienced massive child abuse or traumatic experiences before they were exposed or ran away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical capabilities) that are almost completely consistent with those of its specific caregiver, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning was supposed to make the learning process easier and more interesting, 'scaffolding' takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but rather a means of helping individuals in a novel learning situation, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little office stapler in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are built into the software and are designed to question, suggest and explain work steps that the student may not be able to complete on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving and educational, but many are forced to do so.
We believe that the foster care system is a safety net for these children.
Our foster family system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The care facility is designed to meet all the needs that they did not have in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication as well as interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in the benefit and reward approach.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are cited as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuous relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights into the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that you can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.x
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who cannot understand language because of brain damage can still appreciate the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic variations and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blend the variation between the two pools with each generation back and forth.
Outside in the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of man to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Also, neglect can have serious consequences - growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal food sources (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep-wake accounting is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep periods and falling asleep shortly (10-60 minutes) later.
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you're someone who imagines the alarm clock in your sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room, so that you're forced to leave the bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known to be diuretic) before bedtime, so that you are forced to stand up to urinate.
The degree of inner calm that a person has is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the life force is, and everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded to include the path of love of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga, where the visualization of various deities cleanses the energy channels, opens the chakras, and brings about enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, the clash of systems, history and culture led to the countries becoming enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and in reality, it would be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already completely collapsed and the only hope was a retreat and a re-positioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, creating them after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient method of transporting large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that a country remains able to transport people and goods, while impeding the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign in World War II, when the Americans tried to move personnel and equipment across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have conquered Britain, as it would have the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated in the Zāgros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock for their milk, fur, meat, and skin.
The goats were usually kept in herds, roaming on hills or other pastures, and tended by goat herders, much like the better known sheep herders; often children or adolescents.
In the 16th century, England was built a conveyor railway.
Although the rails were simply parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to reach higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the rougher roads of the time.
Early on, thresholds were used to secure the rails, but gradually it became clear that rails with a band of iron were more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known form of human locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk uprightly two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning "Straight Man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright with such regularity.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to help alleviate some of the future suffering.
In many cases this is merely symptomatic treatment, but if you want more than temporary solutions, we should find the root of the problem and treat it.
It is indeed evident that the world has changed greatly because of mankind's scientific and technological advances and that the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and people's extravagant ways of life.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 surviving Dunlap Breast Pages are the oldest extant copies of the document, and the original manuscript has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and are still alive today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But many things about birds still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on processing information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that diagnosis is not immediately possible.
The best indication of ingestion poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "Wanze" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this insect group.
This term derives from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both bedbugs and predatory bedbugs are nidicol, that is, adapted to live in the nest or housing of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young to middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or in their child's best interest to raise a baby.
These couples can opt for an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over the parenting duties.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, which is the basis of most scientific research.
However, it is not just about experimenting, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses.
Natural scientists and philosophers concentrated on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
The loss of Greek language meant that the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behaviour are often based in substantial part on the presence of cycles in the body and their production by biological clocks.x
Behaviour patterns determined by a cycle, which are not merely reactions to signals from external cycles, are known in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that perform free-swinging cycles for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key indications that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled either the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wild plants and animals.
Examples of activities on site are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to work and are passed by others whose workplace is in the place they just left.
In this dynamic commuter traffic, everyone is in some way connected to and supports a transport system based on the private car.
Science now points out that this massive carbon economy has brought the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear such complaints about the quality of water or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems fail like this, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent, or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows is difficult because you cannot predict driver behaviour with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, motorists tend to behave with some consistency; therefore, traffic flows have a certain consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main properties have been defined: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of facilities on the track.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the skies, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small hiding places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and hummingbirds.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, since you don't really feel the earth is moving, do you?
The Amazon is the second-longest and most water-rich river on earth, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second-largest stream.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, some up to six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans via the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers long, and it draws water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or technical perfection of construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language of most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper have been known to man since ancient times, as they are all found in their original form in nature and can be mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that all things are made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but he also theorized that they would change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
The universe as a whole is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them would fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became a good friend to many people after its invention.
Sadly, with the advent of newer writing methods, the pencil has been pushed into the background, so that it has been relegated to a lower status and to a lower use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pin.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that you need energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
So, if you're going to do this, you're going to be able to do it in a way that's similar to how you would roll a heavy truck up a hill, and if you split the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they break apart with little or no impact.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the mare and thicker under the highlands.
On the near side, there might be more maria, because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what moves or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they mature.
These theories deal with what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what influences in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Bedarfshierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, there are two behaviours that can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or "one of the girls").
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and disciplining employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who has to do everything differently than the team did and makes everything his own.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are run to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a contact point for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be considered by the local management.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.The invisible team sets the benchmark for each member.x"
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of introducing a learning organisation?
When all available resources are used effectively across all departments in an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organisation to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative approach to responding to customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more efficient.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thereby narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injury and tumors, affect behavior and change some of the brain's functions.
Emerging technologies are allowing us to see and study certain brain structures and processes for the first time.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand what's going on in our minds.
AI is strongly associated with science fiction, but is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves the manufacture of machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behaviour.
Examples include control, strategy and timing, ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become their own separate disciplines, focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in business, medicine, engineering and the military, and has been incorporated into many software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is out of the question.
A technical solution is virtual excursions, where pupils can view museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is updated every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a compilation album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing skills of students, although students often have a sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, but that usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blogger makes an effort to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to learn more about the world around them" and the need to arouse the interest of the audience inspires students to write cleverly and in an interesting way (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can empower pupils to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online material, pupils can define their positions in the context of others' texts and express their own perspectives on particular topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting, bilingual capital, and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled beauty of nature extends to Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what outsiders consider to be typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A demographic comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than there are citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, as far as wildlife is concerned, a continent of its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or French possessions and are known for luxurious sea bathing.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and in the Comoros and Mayotte it was very successful.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama discovered the route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travellers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (but not one that looks too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider assault, and that it is not uncommon to be chased, grabbed, etc.
Be consistent in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to defend your point of view (cultural differences or otherwise; that doesn't mean it's okay!)
The present-day city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, the Romans and the Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida and it was called Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tajin, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a whole spectrum of tinfoil, but that's all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be carefully planned to learn about the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb of Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short trip.x
This, combined with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although Timbuktu is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport, it is an impoverished city today.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Louis Gates PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has an Arab flair rather than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different animal world.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily protection and entry fees.
It may also be worthwhile to purchase a wild card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is the focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared to a dazzling bar chart, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.x
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urbanisation is crammed onto newly acquired land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took over, and if you're looking for any traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching over 80 kilometers from the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands to the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that lies within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, with most buses, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses between the districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and stable.
Taxi services provide a quick and convenient way to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Its two towers are 83 metres high, its length is 378 metres and it has two lanes of 3.50 metres width.
The bridge has a crossing height of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, and the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.x
Paraguay, formerly known as the Province of the West Indies, was founded in the 16th century as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can be viewed here at other times of the year.x
Information on competitions and sales points for polo tickets can be found at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is set in line with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West Store.
The British pound is accepted throughout the islands and on Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also widely accepted.
In the remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and US currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance for payment methods.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands themselves, so you should exchange the money before leaving the island.x
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely go below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: the amount of precipitation remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to the sight of humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority has instructed visitors to keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapitis, elk, bears, and virtually all large animals may appear, they may turn on one another.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep enough distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them plenty of room.
Also, be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious naval dispute in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with nearly 200 Americans and Germans killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) beaches are on the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches with safe bathing facilities, and most offer shade, provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the harbour of Waitemata, the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay, and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a nice shopping promenade along the coast.
The most important local beer is Number One. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called Manta.
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines are perhaps better tolerated.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you are worried, you can easily find bottled water.
"To an Australian, the idea of a coffee is 'flat white', a small black is 'espresso', a cappuccino is filled with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk".
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.x
However, you should follow the advice of the authorities, pay attention to all signs and especially pay attention to safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770, and may occasionally occur outside this time period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are not active in the sea, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have arrangements with specific hotels, although you may also be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies commonly offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of a flight and a hotel.
You can also reserve your reservation for yourself if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries should be directed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festivalgoers choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you have to get there early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that there are parts of the festival that will still play music late into the night, even though the music on the main stages has already stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of the cabin, as the breakthrough of ice causes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St Petersburg also provide time for a stay in the city.
Casinos generally make a great effort to keep guests in as long as possible and to keep them spending a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes hard to find.
They usually have a special offer of food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to ensure that they stay.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all who are good players know the importance of staying sober.
Those who want to travel at high latitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and sub-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, the risk is low and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
In a blizzard, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be affected by falling or drifting snow or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs for the most part uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to describe a trip to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, leopards, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called a bushwalk, hiking safari, or footing) consists of a hike that lasts either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events being held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the event will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with an average ticket costing ¥7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them. Many hotels lend irons and ironing boards even when you are not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a broom, if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (this can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are various methods of purifying water, some of which have proved more effective in eliminating certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others it may take several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unfamiliar to them from their home regions.
Insects can destroy food, cause irritation, or, in the worst cases, even cause allergic reactions, poisoning, or disease.
Infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not usually classified as pests.
Duty free shopping is the possibility of buying goods which are exempt from excise duty and taxes in certain places.
Travellers whose destination country has a high tax rate can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway is perhaps the most challenging driving section, as it often passes through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common here.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
But interestingly, the cell phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, as is the case in Austria, our southern neighbour.
Fruit pie is widely used, with apples being baked all year round and cherries and plums used in summer.
Many German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, try what is called berliner, pancake, or potato, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish that is based on herbs and spices, along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland in northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is a catchall term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further attribution, it usually refers to food originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spicy dishes, with the Javanese preferring peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and a number of aromatic spices as flavorings.
The footrests are the supports for the feet of the rider, which are suspended on either side of the saddle.
They give the rider more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet may get caught in them.
If a rider falls off the horse and gets his foot caught on the stirrup, he may be dragged along as the horse passes.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a single sole and a smooth, fairly narrow sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety harnesses that allow a harness strap to fall off the saddle as soon as it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley  Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.

Downhill sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which a skier or snowboarder is strapped to his feet and is led down a slope over a snow-covered surface.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as skippers, planning their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It is similar to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but does not necessarily include them, as the latter are performed on steep terrain and require much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a comparable hiking route.
In good conditions you are able to cover somewhat greater distances than when you are hiking. It is very rare that you will reach the speed of cross-country skiing on well-kept trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for several visas and pass through several passport controls if you wanted to travel through several countries.
But in this respect the Schengen area functions a little bit like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries individually, which saves time, money and red tape.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are considered antiques, and some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations where the age limit may be lower in areas such as North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be described as antik, although they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many who work in other professions.
In the past, the Sámi did not raise reindeer in large numbers, but lived by fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer mainly as a draught animal.
Today, many Sámi work in modern occupations, and tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
"Although the term 'Gypsy' is widely used, especially by non-Roma, it is often perceived as offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma".
If a travel document is issued for the country you are visiting, your travel health insurance or travel reimbursement insurance may be affected.
They may also consult the advice of governments other than their own, but their advice is tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The Council is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often superficial, general and overly simplified in comparison with the more detailed information found elsewhere.
A storm is a collective term for any dangerous weather event with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption or loss of life.
Storms can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of storms depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, blizzards, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any weather conditions affecting their area as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that is considered a war zone should receive professional training.
"A web search for 'Hostile Environments Course' will likely return the address of a local business".
A course covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, usually in combination with practical experience.
A course is usually between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and journals on survival in the wilderness, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure that they carry valid identification documents for the return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognise these documents also varies widely.
The security searches have also become much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who are undergoing surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to be intact when they pass the scanner.
Rift currents are the current that comes back from waves breaking on the beach, often at reefs or similar.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper areas and a fast flow to deep water can form there.
Most deaths are caused by overtiredness in trying to swim backwards, which may prove impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back in is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get to a place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, you might wait for rescue.
The return shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase is not as pronounced), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture may find it particularly difficult to adjust back to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a different culture and have lost some of the ways of your home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely to be patient and understanding, because they knew that travelers must adapt to a new country.
One may not expect that patience and understanding are needed with returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in the silence before the show starts.
Normally, you hear the noises of tourists and vendors all the time, but the story of the noises and the lights is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, with the various pyramids being illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest of which is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworthland is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by Lake Bellingshausen.
The mountains of the peninsula cross over into the plateau here and then rise again to form the 360-mile chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (15,930 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside and in clear line of sight of a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure vessels, and by expeditions requiring data and voice communications.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information on connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is study and course offers abroad.
This is especially popular among graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a transnational programme can actually improve your chances of obtaining higher education in your home country.
The study programme is usually subject to a tuition fee.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips.The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht to go to the archipelago and the lakes.
While the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national recreational activity in Finland, and one in six or eight owns a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the ratio is one in forty).
Most Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for several full days, returning in the evening and spending the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore during the Bordeaux excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise companies list Berlin, Germany, as a destination in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by air can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There is no need to be ashamed of this: it is nothing but the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes operate and the procedures involved in flight can help some to overcome the fear of the unknown or of feeling out of control.
Courier companies are well paid for the rapid delivery of things. Time is often a very important factor in business documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes the larger companies use their own aircraft, but on others and with smaller companies difficulties arose.
When they were shipping things by air, unloading and clearing customs on some routes could take several days.
The only way to get through it faster was to send it as checked baggage, and airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, better yet, to get your own company to cover the cost).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and the eleven-fold for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money and charge a premium for the privilege of getting to their destination quickly and comfortably.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic which has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognised by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were restored.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transport hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a modern, advanced, and bustling commercial center, situated on a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are characterised by classic red tiled roofs, the 18th century marketplace and old mosques and churches, although the city has a Mediterranean European feel rather than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
Above some of the graves in the cemetery are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons.
It is worth half an hour to wander through the fascinating village.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to outsiders after Lord Byron described its splendor in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly from Cabo da Roca to Sintra.
Also in the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (place of pilgrimage)  a place world famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are basically visiting a mass grave and a place that has almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who have survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered or worked to death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this place with the dignity, reverence and respect that you deserve, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not defile the site by graffiti or scratches.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are in Catalan, which is the first official language of the government.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Normal announcements in the metro are made in Catalan only, but unforeseen disturbances are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are told to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an untrue cliché, the best way to get around Paris is to show your best side and behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated).
The rough appearance of the Parisians will soon disappear if you show basic manners.
The Plitwitzer Lakes National Park is heavily forested, with mainly beech, spruce and pine trees and a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable diversity of plant communities, thanks to its numerous microclimates, diverse soils and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to a very large variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and raccoons, as well as many more common species, can be found there.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that go above the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have wrap-around skirts for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that reach above the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes will not be washed after each wearer, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts.
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is the Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any ingredients that are readily available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
"All nouns begin with a capital letter beside the word you for 'you' even in the middle of a sentence".
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used as a main word.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies with the following vowel.
"Also, be careful to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means 'love' and carro means 'street car'".
The Persian language has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar will help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand phrasing better.
Of course, if you speak a Romance language, it is easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't need to learn it extra.
Pre-modern observatories are now usually no longer in operation and serve as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on university campuses that are easier to reach than those built more recently.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other nobles in the vicinity of the imperial court.
"Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even a single specimen".
If you go to a formal garden and collect 'samples', you will also be thrown out without discussion.

Make sure the bus you want to ride goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or a cruise to interesting towns on the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They are also popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is considered to be the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the festival have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian and non-Christian lands around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the communal celebrations often beginning at midnight, celebrating the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands either came by swimming, flying or wading.
Because of the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main food animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans first set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, as the sky is more or less dark around the clock.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
Suits are part of the normal business attire, and colleagues address each other by their family name or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with the focus being on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees must seek the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions unconditionally.
