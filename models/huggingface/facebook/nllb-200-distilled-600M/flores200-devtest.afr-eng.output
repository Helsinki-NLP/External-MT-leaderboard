Not only does this confirm that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, which is already a widespread theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut brown above with a velvet or carotenoid-colored underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shell, also called the rhachis, but have other features of feathers - shells and bearded side branches - the researchers concluded that the rhachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature regulation or rejection. The researchers suggest that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not chicken's fangs.
The researchers suggested that even though it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed adult feathers and not chicken donkeys.

The work being done is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team sought would be caused by forces of attraction between the galaxy's dark matter and the galaxy's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls on earth, causing the waves, so the Milky Way pulls on the Milky Way.
The scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found in a type of radiation corona, and is made up of very small particles.

In France, voting was traditionally a low-tech experience: voters isolated themselves in a cage, and then put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the candidate of their choice, in an envelope.
After officials confirm the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law has codified these procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, polls must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes were present at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes were added except those counted and registered by registered voters.
Candidates can send representatives to follow each part of the process.

The road where the collision took place was temporarily closed while emergency services rescued the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Greater Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son in Edinburgh's Sherrif Court.
She is in custody awaiting her indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may have been affected because her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish legal systems work differently and courts have seen the publication of the photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists cross a dangerous line when they publish photos etc. of suspects.
Crown Office, which has overall control of prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until prosecution.
The document will, according to the informant, refer to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 Middle Eastern War.
Other subjects reportedly covered include the future state of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a sustained military presence in the valley for 10 years once an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees to leave such a presence only for five years.
Field guards closely monitored shots in the supplementary pest control test, as the test was monitored and effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the NPWS and the Sport Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Shooter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, the NPWS' Acting Director of Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shotguns selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly sworn in a new nine-member provincial electoral council yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country forward after new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections, some already due since 2011.
Around 60 cases of unstable iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
METI announced last week that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The cabinet responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "truly a pity".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 a.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office stated that no damage was reported in the nation.
The Pacific Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been reported dead.
Six hostages, including kidnapped and elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to use the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He studied for a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research preterm births in his spare time.
Her research has shown that, if hormones are administered, they will speed up the fetal lung development of the baby.
Xinhua reports that the state's investigation team recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
People's crows also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extremes. My first manager, Luna, died on the night of two moons.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented that Luna was just as strange as I was... maybe even more... loving her and will miss her... hopefully she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 previous electors in the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those in the poll share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth ll to be Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist, who had to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, and in three Commonwealth Games, was challenged for his fitness due to his complaints.
He could not use the medicine he needed to overcome his pain because it was forbidden from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware or software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water supply to the earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets originate, especially how the earth formed, since comets collided with the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his governorship earlier this year and signed a bill that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as political gossip and folly.
People speculate that he will make an effort in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FLA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and cutting carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to pin the aircraft down with greater precision and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transportation is available, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking and stop-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a loss of transport have increased the possibility that the game will be forced behind closed doors and without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science mentioned the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the species has adapted in only two generations, although this process was believed to take much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can also be rolled into small moldings.
It can be pulled out in a thin thread, twisted or folded, or pulled out or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and pasted onto other metals, and can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical's pH. You can make a pH indicator by using red carbonate juice.
The color of the carbonate juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkali) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (the H in the pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which the electrons are extracted (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Turn the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, it will feel funny and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-dara had a toilet in almost every home, and it was attached to a sophisticated sewerage system.
Remnants of drainage systems have been found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were also used. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back, almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket about 100 feet [100 m] high to put a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing that the wheel has given us is much easier and faster transportation.
It brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey such as rabbits and goats.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that by far eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, each cat has a special job that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups known as herds.
Lion troops consist of one to three related males, along with as many as thirty females and young.
The wives are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly close to lions (but not to other large cats) in action, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion, but more like a sense of harrowing shouting.
Little cats like to eat small animals. They catch apes, snakes, rodents, and birds as much as they can. Almost all the animals that the wildcat hunts are smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that the oselotte (prey) follow and find animals by sniffing.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and also move invisibly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) are removed from the main population from which they come (such as when they cross a mountain range or river, or when they move to a new island so that they cannot easily retreat) they will find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
The new environment has different resources and other competition, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously needed to be a strong competitor.
The original population has changed little, still requiring the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will differ so much that they cannot even be called the same species.
We call this process spatiation, which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build our homes and make clothing, and most of our food is plants, and without plants animals would not be able to live.
Mosasaurus was the predator at the top of the food chain of his time, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaw has more than 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a tongue that was rough, his diet included shells, big fish, moss, and he may have been a cannibal himself.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not be able to resist it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own share of strange or unusual feasts that included wild boar, fox, snail, and a type of reptile known as a hazel mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men preferred to hold banquets together where they lay on their sides and ate their meals.
Ancient Roman food could not have included food that came to Europe from America, or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner room where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, also enough ziggurats, were built to be part of the temples.
The upper part of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were just open countertops facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas, Erik the Red is told to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and while traveling further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already lived there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
IF you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Even if something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" were engraved on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, the large parking document (measuring 293⁄4 inch by 241⁄2 inch) was rolled up for scrap.
So, it's possible that the notation was simply added as n label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent fighting liberated the north of France, but still the south was not free.
They were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of baking with them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and French forces liberated the south of France and turned them over to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significant large group of people who work together and live and work as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or like a city, and it also defines the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilized culture is based on the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a perpetual cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence behind and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since there was no national executive or judicial branch, they relied on state authorities, who often refused to cooperate, to carry out all their acts.
Nor did it have any authority to transgress tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be changed and states take the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, screen, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Northern regions, with Italians participating in International Games and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an archipelago due to the number of islands that Japan has.
Taiwan began long ago in the 15th century when European sailors passed by to adopt the island's name as Ilha Formose, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, and a transformation into native grain production practices by hiring Chinese workers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
Qing dynasty (1644  1912) forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Policy, transferring sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have already been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been destroyed, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size by the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio was superseded by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The image ratio of this format (by dividing twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example the APS family of formats) are equivalent to or close to estimated to this aspect ratio.
The often-abused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates motion while maintaining some order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the crossing of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith has united European states despite linguistic and cultural differences.
Its all-pervading power affected everyone; from the king to the members of the community.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the financial foundation of the church is there specifically for this reason.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church has been in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question this premise.
Shortly after the outbreak of riots, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective; it cut vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade broke generally accepted international laws by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain was mining in international waters to prevent any ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which would mean danger even to neutral ships.
Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his previous work) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also between each dynasty a volatile period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods of the Three Kingdoms period occurred in the 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
During these periods, there was intense warfare among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in Ancient Chinese history; thousands died fighting to take the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to one ruler.
After the Revolution, jobs were also open to male applicants who allowed the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
Diesel is true for the military, as the army ranges are now based on caliber, rather than class.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in events beyond this earthly life. He frequently visited a cave that became known as Hira on the Mountain of Nor (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived for a long time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world, and rests atop one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is not easy to find, even if one knew it existed.
Nothing but the clean, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of this world can be heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of the many great pyramid structures built to honor the death of Pharaoh.
The Giza Plato, or Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramids were created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward arc is like a V and the downward arc is like a clutch or a square without its lower side.
On means you must start at the tip and press the bow, and down means you must start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-arc usually creates a softer sound, while a down-arc is stronger and more self-explanatory.
Feel free to write down your own points, but remember that the printed lines are there for a musical reason, so they should normally be respected.
The feared King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to flee back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
In a chariot, they traveled back to Paris while surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open wide the windows of their chariot.
At one point, a member of the protesters waved the head of a royal who had been killed at Versailles before the frightened Queen.
The war costs of U.S. imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They are forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay off a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds has been driven through Wall Street bank buildings on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits derived from the extensive exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Temple servants, one must understand the context that led to the establishment of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended by convention around 1500.
Technological determination is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological necessity in the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic accompanied by scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most disruptions of technological determination share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself goes beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, produces effects on societies that are indigenous rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the carriage necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a countrywide road network is not economically viable for only a handful of cars, so new methods of production are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass vehicle ownership also leads to road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques in health care for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a large element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the physical environment formed individuals, and in time, customs and culture associated with that environment emerged, and these things, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was counted as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began about 400 A.D. and lasted until about 1100 A.D.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts like herbs and spices of greater value than Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and into the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
Because of the slow communication channels, western styles can be left behind by 25 to 30 a year.
Near the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest developments of the time was the crusades that began with knots for making clothes.
Cattle farming is farming done to produce only enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Crop farming is a simple, organic system that preserves seeds that are native to the ecosystem combined with alternate farming or other relatively easy techniques to increase yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this continues to be the case in many developing nations.
Individuals with similar feelings of neglect by community standards are brought together by subcultures, and allowed to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are characteristic by the age, ethnic origin, status, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that clearly define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through the distinctive and symbolic use of styles, which include fashions, manners, and informal language.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by focusing on the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults as they grew up by neglect, unfavorable circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some wild children have been entangled by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases this abandonment is attributed to parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical limitations.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some have remained alone in the wilderness.
When a wild child is raised entirely by nonhuman animals, it exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost entirely like that of the particular caring animal, such as the fear or indifference of humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, stewardship goes one step further.
Taxation is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that provides support to individuals who are beginning to use a new learning method, such as a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Eggs can be both virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a form of eater but so is the little slider male in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Eggs is in the software and is meant to question, speed up, and explain procedures to students who would find the process difficult to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but that is the reality.
We see the Nursing System as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Care is supposed to provide all the necessities that were suspended in the home from where they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and reward approach.
For example, learning and socializing are proposed as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When Eighmey and McCord (1998) examined audience responses to websites, they identified their personal engagement and ongoing relationships as new motivational aspects.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is reported that one can pick up when a person lies by correctly interpreting the micro-expressions.
In his document, The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks showed how people who were unable to understand the speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
He even suggested that such abilities to interpret human behavior be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation process adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination mix variation back and forth between the two pools of each generation.
On the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plants available there.
Further, failure to do so has serious consequences: suppressed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant sources would have been proteins, which are found in leaves and pollination, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal cousins (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our predecessors solved their own protein problem in a way similar to the way some chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep disruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling back asleep for a short time afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you catch yourself setting the clock in your sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to put it down.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids, (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic), before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has correlates with the amount of stress in a person's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force that is present. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the mahayana path of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (relief energy) is stimulated by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga, where the visualization of various gods clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a joint enemy in World War II, led by the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war and the clashes of system, process and culture that led to the countries falling apart.
Within two years of the war's end, former allies became present enemies and the Cold War began.
It was the last for the next 40 years and would be fought, in effect, by standing armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans were executed overnight, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after entering the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the fleet has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and goods, while at the same time interfering with your enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Expedition of WWII. The Americans sought to get men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet, which mostly used U-boats, tried to stop traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would very likely have been able to conquer Britain as it could conquer the rest of Europe.
Goats were first made in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were commonly kept in flocks that walked over the hills and other pasture areas, and were looked after by herdsmen who were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widespread shepherds. These methods of tending are still used today.
Washing machines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the rails were mostly made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses they dragged to do so at greater speeds and with greater loads than it would take to do so on the rougher roads of the day.
Although crossbars were installed fairly early to hold the tracks in place, it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if there was an iron strip at the top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more finishing of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first pure iron railings were introduced.
The first known mode of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the rise of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Two-legged specialties are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to combat future suffering to some extent.
This is just like the symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we are not looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should make them harmless.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advancement, and problems have become greater as a result of overpopulation and humanity's excessive lifestyle.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the site of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap sweep that still exists are known to be the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scabs and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers - or bits, to use computer terminology.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are so common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of open-container medications or household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for the group of insects.
The term is derived from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitise on humans.
Both Assassin bugs and Bed bugs are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or home of their host.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to develop an adoption plan for their baby.
With an adoption, the birth parents terminate their parenting so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works by using a scientific method, which actually accompanies most scientific research.
Although not alone, experimentation, and an experiment in a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe also direct scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological bells.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological bells are self-sustaining oscillators that will sustain a period of free-running cycles, even in the absence of external induction.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments that labelled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas with the goal of enjoying the environment, including plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching and visiting parks and studies of ecosystem information.
An example is visiting Borneo and learning about the early Tang and photographing them.
Every morning, people leave the small villages in carts to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the area they recently moved from.
In this dynamic commute, everyone is connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science points out that this massive carbon economy has affected the stable states of the biosphere that have supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in the community and uses the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling flat.
Why are transport systems raising such complaints, why are they failing on a daily basis? Is transport incompetence just incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, a study of traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers operate within a reasonably consistent range; and thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the 3 main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of driving-level facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid their enemies more easily and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back onto the body.
This provides them with a wide variety of small spots to sneak away from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are needle-hunters and day flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believe the opposite; that the solar system moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times the amount of water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the longest river on Earth, at times six miles wide.
A full 20 percent of the water flowing from the planet's rivers into oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main river is 6,387 miles [3,980 km] long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never outclassed in size and engineering excellence.
New Kingdom ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City's population is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language by many uses in states where Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, and these can all be found in nature in their basic form and are relatively simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
These were more like the four stages of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he had a theory that they could change into new forms changing what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
Alloys may also exist that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them can fit at that point at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many when it came out.
Unfortunately, the status and use of the pencil declined as new writing methods were adopted.
People now write messages on account screens, and they don't have to get close to a sharpener.
One can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new is passed.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's almost like pushing a heavy carriage up a hill, splitting a nucleus releases that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they break apart with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the oceans and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more maria nearby because the crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around what motivates or pleases people.
These theories assume that humans have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they mature.
These theories look at what it is of certain people that causes them to want the things they do and the good in their environment that makes them do certain good or not do it.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start coaching their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is to remain one of the men (or girls).
This type of manager struggles to make unpopular decisions, to carry out disciplinary actions, to evaluate employee performance, to assign responsibilities, and to hold employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels like he or she needs to change everything the team was doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior sometimes causes a breach between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members as their teams meet at different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a visual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards there for each member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process to create a learning organization? One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across functional departments of an organization, creativity and wisdom can flourish.
As a result, the process of an organization works together to overcome the obstacle and can lead to a new innovation process to serve the customer's needs.
Leadership must create a culture of creation, as well as shared knowledge and organized study before an organization can be innovative.
Angel (2006), described the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of work performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to exploring cognition, so it narrows down the research area and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, tears, and crops affect behavior and in some cases alter some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes like never before.
These provide us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models to help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although it has strong connections to science fiction, Al forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include management, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and queries as well as handwriting recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI cysteine is now commonly used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, and is also built into various home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any classroom. A teacher often wants to take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual field trips, where students can look at museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also a good way to reflect on an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett School in North Carolina create a webcast about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is re-modeled, but old versions are kept online and serve as a booklet.
While students regularly begin their web journal experience with dirty language use and spelling, the presence of observers usually changes it.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the web journalist begins to pursue improved writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging forces students to become more adept about the world around them.) The need to feed the interest of the crowd inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to take learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' writings, as well as to develop their own perspectives on certain boxes (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and contains a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagra Falls and to the north is the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka and surrounding area.
All of these and more characterize Ontario than true Canadians are perceived by outsiders.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
When it comes to wildlife, Madagascar is by far the largest continent on its own.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, and it took a strong hold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, as explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any women travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (as long as it is one that does not seem expensive).
Women need to realize that cultural differences may cause them to feel harassed, and that it is not uncommon to be persecuted, held in the arm, etc.
Be firm when you turn men away, and don't be afraid to stand up for your rights (cultural differences or not, that doesn't make it right!).
The modern city of Casablanca, founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya and it was the name Casablanca given by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the less interesting shops to shop in all of Morocco.
To the old Medina it is easy to find places that have traditional Moroccan goods, such as Moroccan pots, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and a whole spectrum of excesses, but it is as for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Far East near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping-off point for the Nyiragongo volcano, along with the cheapest mountain gorilla trails in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for the short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is now used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation as a tourist attraction has led to an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the dangers of desert sands.
This was one of the main standouts during Henry Louis Gates' special PBS program, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, because it has more of an Arab flair than an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeastern part of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different eco zones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance and entrance fees for the park.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card that gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the area of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has already been compared to a glowing column chart that is accentuated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best scenery of Hong Kong, leave the island and travel to the Kowloon waterfront on the other side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's rural development is heavily packed with reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves, and so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) into the interior of Bangladesh and Indian hinterland from the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that falls in Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not merely halophyte swamps - they include some of the last remaining stands of mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about one third of which is covered by water/ marshlands.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now some 400 Royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted goats in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going in an eastern direction, depart for Jakar/Bumthang between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is suggested that one buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese Coaster Buses, which are reliable and robust.
Shared rental cars are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paru (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200), for example.
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters and are 378 meters long and have two lanes of 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge will be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most remarkable indigenous group to inhabit the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, and they inhabited the area as semi-nomadic hunters who also applied subsistence farming.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the Great Province of the Indies, was born as a result of the skirmishing of Spanish conquerors with the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three - century period of colonization.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds would be generally accepted elsewhere in the islands and within, Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are also regularly accepted.
In the remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and U.S. currencies will be accepted; ask the owners in advance to determine the accepted payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures barely go below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than the thermometer says.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, nature is wild nonetheless and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 feet away from bears, wolves, and 25 feet [25 m] from all other wildlife.
No matter how soft they appear, buffalo, goat, American goat, bear and can attack almost any large animal.
Thousands of visitors are injured each year because of a lack of distance, and these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they give their space.
Be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying around or cooking scented food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval stand in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British warship.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the village resulted in the death of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland is spread over two ports.
North Coast beaches (in North Harbour district) are opposite the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming spots, and most have shady spots provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Rylaan beaches are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Sometimes there are crowded family beaches with a good variety of shops on the edge of the beach.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer but pleasant and refreshing.
Many French wines are available, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better transported.
The local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black is "espresso", cappuccino is served with whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is equivalent to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trains are taken to the coral reefs throughout the year, and injuries to the coral reef from any of these causes are rare.
Still, take the advice of authorities, obey all notices, and heed security warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not really live in the ocean, their primary habitat is in river beds north of Rockhampton.
Prebooking gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have somewhere to slumber when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find it impossible to book other types of accommodation, such as campgrounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include breakfast, airport/departure transportation arrangements and even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold the reservations for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or inquiries must go through the travel agent and not directly through the hotel.
For some music festivals, the largest number of attendees decide to camp on the site, and most see it as an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be near the action, you have to get in early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while music may end at the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic in winter, make sure the hut's location, as it makes a loud noise, is for those most affected to pass through the ice.
Saint Petersburg boat trips include time in the town. Ride passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the terms).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the amount of money spent by guests. Windows and bells are usually absent, and exits may be difficult to find.
To stick to their principles and to keep guests in a good mood, they usually have special offers on food, drink, and entertainment.
Some places offer free alcoholic drinks, but drunkenness affects your judgment, and all good gamblers realize the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who is going to drive over mountain passes at high latitudes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
Cracking on icy and snowy roads is very low, and you cannot drive like you are on a bare dirt road.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall quickly in a short time to trap you.
The visibility may also be limited by falling or windward snow or by condensation of ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The popular term safari used popularly refers to overseas travel to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and camels, tend to approach carts, and standard equipment will allow good viewing.
Lions, hunting foxes, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with predators.
A walk (also called a forest walk, walk, or walk) consists of a walk of several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the exhibition is announced, you may have a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until June 2020 for when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000 and up.
Many hotels have a stitching board and a striped board available to borrow, even if there is none in the room.
If a hairstyle is not available or you do not like to wear stretched socks, try using a hairstyle if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the material (otherwise it may shrink or, in extreme cases, scratch).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others, a few minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not familiar to them in their home regions.
Plagues can spoil food, cause irritation, or at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods, exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers to countries with heavy taxes can sometimes save a considerable sum, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, where it frequently goes into abandoned inland terrain.
If you are not accustomed to driving on rural roads, keep your distance: steep gradients, narrow lanes, and steep curves prevail.
Speed limits are noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict compliance with them is even more important than otherwise.
Strangely, the mobile phone service here is better than many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are still delicious, and in Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit paste is common, with apples baked in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer months.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often well paired with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but rich dough slices, try what is called the Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
A cherry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with meat or vegetables.
A cherry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
Inland regions of Northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is common in cherries; in Southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of local dishes from across the nation.
However, when used with further qualifiers, the term tends to mean food originally from central and eastern parts of mainland Java.
Javanese food now freely available over the archipelago is characteristic of simple scented dishes, the prominent flavoring agent for Javanese food being peanuts, burnt rice, sugar (specifically Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Bulls are for supporting the rider's feet that hang on either side of the hall.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may pose safety risks due to the possibility that the rider's feet may become trapped in them.
If a horse throws the rider down and his foot is stuck in the stake, it can be pulled together when the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a hip and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Next, some halls, especially English halls, have safety bars that allow a strap to fall off the hall if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Mountain ruins include breathtaking views of peaks, and climbers from around the world are constantly looking for new routes between the endless rock walls.
Down-mountain skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport involving skating or snowboarding on a snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski boomerangs" who plan entire vacations to ski to a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings dating back as far as 5,000 B.C. depict skiers!
Descending skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski tours: This activity may also be called inland skiing, ski touring, or skiing step.
It is related to but does not include alpine skiing or mountain climbing tours, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring tougher skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a step route.
Under good conditions you will cover somewhat greater distances than by foot  but only very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack in neat tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would have meant going through visa applications and passport control points multiple times.
The Schengen area, nevertheless, works somewhat like one country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross borders without going through passport control checkpoints again.
Having a Schengen visa does not require you to apply for each Schengen member state separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of whether manufactured items are antique or not. Some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antique.
The definition has geographic variations, where the age limit may be shorter in places such as North America than in Europe.
