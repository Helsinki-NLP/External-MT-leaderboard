When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (as if they were moving across a mountain or a river, or if they were moving to a new island and could not easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population adapts to their new environment, they start to look less and less like the other populations.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species.

The most commonly used photographic format for still images worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but mainly its aspect ratio was taken over by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
35mm is actually something that you can change a little bit, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is denoted here as 3:2.

The much-abused and often-mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
Note that the most effective location for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put on the pedestal.

Her all-pervasive power has affected everyone, from the king to the common man.

The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to doubt whether this principle has been fulfilled.

The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, codified by more international agreements of the last two centuries.
UK mined international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire sections of the ocean, putting even neutral ships in danger.

n the 1920s, the dominant attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and horrors of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
1884 - Tesla emigrates to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) at Thomas Edison.

The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris by a mob of merchants from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They drove back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were running and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open their carriage windows wide.
On one occasion, a mob participant held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrifying queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, for a large part of the spending and the interest on the bonds was flowed on behalf of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.

To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The era in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the eras of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices; from the technology-push or technological necessity to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying guiding logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely outweighs cultural or political influences and that technology in turn has "impacts" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially determined.
It might be said, for instance, that the car necessarily led to the development of roads.

Romance has a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.



Their status during the twelfth century was diminished mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were of more value than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th to 11th and 14th centuries.

The Western stars could be 25 to 30 years behind because of the slow communication channels.

Subsistence economy is agriculture, which is carried out for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system that combines the sums derived from the ecoregion with the yields or uses other relatively simple techniques to optimize yields.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together equal individuals who feel neglected by societal norms, and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be unchangeable based on age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style, encompassing fashion, behavior, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to question the importance of socialization is to go back to some lucky cases of children who were not socialized by neglect, bad luck or male abuse by adults while they were growing up.
Some were abducted by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, the child's task was to return to the abductor after the parents had subjected him to severe mental or physical abuse.
THE YARLES OF THE RUNNING TEEN may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they gave up or fled.
Some are to be eaten by animals; some are to live alone in the wilderness.
If the child is raised by non-human animals, it shows behaviours (within physical limits) that are almost completely similar to those of the respective pet, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a tool that supports individuals who are taking on a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a school teacher is a form of scaffolding, but the same is true for the small office clamps and Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is taught in software and should ask, ask, and explain tasks that might be too difficult for the student to handle on his or her own.

no child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, social and educational, and this is the way it is now.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our care system is supposed to provide a safe home, warm-hearted carers, stable training and reliable healthcare.

Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent properties of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and gratification usage.

"Personal commitment" and "sustainable relationships" were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions facial movements of a few milliseconds.
Primarily, it is claimed that one can tell if a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand language because of deformity are able to accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities are shared in the interpretation of human behavior by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two pools of medicinal variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
The separation and recombination shift the variation with each generation between the two poles here and there.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of a human to meet its amino acid requirements with the available plant resources.
Plus, there are serious consequences if you don't: growth depression, lack of education, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to access would be the proteins and leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if they're not cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (seafood, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a wealth of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.

Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep shortly thereafter (10  60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively slow alarm to wake you up, but not to wake you up completely.
When you turn the clock on while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room, until you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluid (mostly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses is correlated with the degree of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the existing life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can ask for enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own relaxation and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded through the Mahayana Path of Love and through many techniques of Indian Yoga.

Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, the collisions of systems, processes and cultures led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies had developed into enemies, which started the Cold War.
It's going to be 40 years and it's going to be played out in real time by proxies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and in a few other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.

The need for ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's role has traditionally been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to get men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mostly with submarines.
Had the Allies defied, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.

Ancient cultures and peoples considered them to be easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.

Thin fountains were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the tunnels were mainly made of parallel wooden dams, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and larger loads than on the slightly gravel roads of the time.

This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wires of the winches.
Finally, wooden ropes were replaced by iron ropes. 1767 the first railways were introduced.
The earliest known form of transport was walking, and humans began walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as they used to.
Bipedal specialization is found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been bipedal as early as 7 million years ago.

After being passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks further to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who delivered it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy reached London on August 10.
The 25-Dunlap flying saucers, which we know still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.

A poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as fractures are so common that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of underground poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label, you will find specific first-aid instructions for each poison.
The term gum is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.

As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.

Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-aware oscillators that can continue to move for a long time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-an-Chase experiment was one of the first proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, which weathers the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cell is a stem cell.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere could have resulted in cell death or cancer.

Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult, because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.

To better represent traffic flow, relationships were made between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find bait and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more space to hide from predators.
Today, waterfowl and day-old mice are the only insects that cannot flap their wings.

Aristoteles, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the 4 aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.

The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to make a cell nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy wound rolling up a hill, the division of the cell nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they explode with little or no shock.

Content theories focus on figuring out how people click or what they're challenging.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are memorized as they enter adulthood.
e theory, consider what happens to certain people who want the things they want, and what things in their environment make them want certain things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of necessities and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.

This type of leadership has difficulties making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, implementing performance assessments, delegating responsibility and holding employees accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, you become the unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done, and he has to own it.

This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the crew.
Virtual teams are maintained to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a liaison for their immediate physical group.

The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team, where each member reports to the team. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation take on the time-consuming process of building a learning organisation? One of the goals of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively used in the functional areas of a company, creativity and resourcefulness can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organisation working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the customers.
To be innovative, an organisation must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.

Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical use for the study of cognition. Here they are pushing the research field and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumor affect behaviour and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
