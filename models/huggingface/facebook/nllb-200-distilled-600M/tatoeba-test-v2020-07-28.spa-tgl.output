It's stupid to read that magazine.
How big is your family?
I have to stop eating so sweet ice cream.
We have two dogs, three cats and six chickens.
He's not cruel to animals.

I waited a long time.
They'll kill you!
It was a great party, wasn't it?

Who complained?
He just left.
He's eight years older than you.
Tom ran out of gas.
She's always smoking.
I'll tell you my story.
We've finished our lunch.
The question is where to buy that book.
Tom was as scared as Mary was.
Talk to Eliana is like talking to the wall.
There wasn't even a single table available in the whole restaurant.
You can't live on that island.
Tom turns 30 in October.
You are in Europe!

They fear the gods.
He took a book off the shelf.
Tom goes to church every Sunday morning.
Tom called Mary.
Do you really know how to swim?
Let's hope it's good weather tomorrow.
I saw Tom around.
We live in a society, not just an economy.
She was talking as she walked.
I know Tom lied.
Can I eat that cake?
He gave his life for his country.
How many sisters do you have?
I want you to go.

How do you know so much about Japan's history?

I found something even sexier.
I think both Tom and Mary lie.

I love you too.
I read to learn.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
That street was very noisy.
You saw the game?
Pardon us our sins.

Tom didn't want to marry Mary.
Tom claimed to have seen a UFO.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Obviously he did.
I left a note under the door.
How many are there?
Tom crossed the street.
Tom paid me.
My friend never leaves home without cigarettes.
Let me see those pictures.
What did you use at the party?
Everyone says they're innocent.
He made the decision to become a doctor.
Tell Tom what you heard.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
There were no roses in the garden.
He remained silent all day.
You live in Turkey?
Is this art?
Just stopped raining. We can go.
Don't come near us until we forgive you One day you'll regret what you did.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm deaf, and I can't hear you.
We're open tomorrow.
I need the keys.
We talked till 2:00 in the morning.
Never press this button.
The universe confuses me and I can't imagine that clock exists without a clock.
Tom was the soul of the party.
We had a biology exam yesterday.
You'd better see the doctor.
"Encourage me", she said.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Tom couldn't control his emotions.
Why do you want to do this?
You're going to the river with me?
No matter what he said.
Can you walk the distance between your house and the market?
I'm gay.
We have few opportunities to speak German.
Your family needs you.

How beautiful she is!
I'll be there.
I have to take care of the kids tonight.
Fishing is my favorite hobby.
When did you learn to drive?
Seems like there's always something to do.
That kid's pulling my tongue.
The monkey is climbing a tall tree.
Tom is home?
I don't want to eat.
We were playing in the park.
Tom is much younger than Mary.
I caught a big fish yesterday.
Eat and drink.
Yeah, this is Anthony.
I have family in Los Angeles.
I think they're using you.

The earth is round.
I'd like to learn to play banjo.
I have to go.
Do you know who she is?
I'm looking for a house.

I'll clean my room later.
He speaks French?
Sit down there.
Can you repeat that?
We went by the pharmacy before we got home.
Tom's computer isn't answering.
Someone is eating.
She's in the kitchen right now.
I'm going to buy some crust juice.
I just got back from school.
They forgot to wake me.
I know you're a teacher.
Tom is happy.
Ken eats breakfast in the kitchen.
Tom is lucky.

At this distance, the ship looks like an island.
This is the same bag I lost a week ago.
He has written two books.
I love teaching.
Tom doesn't have time to talk now.
How do I solve this problem?
One more.
Tom kissed my hand.
No problem with that.
I'm allergic to milk.
Leave that job to the experts.

He had to help with the housework.
What did Mari buy yesterday?
From where?
Are you going swimming tomorrow?
The table was dusted.
I'm sorry I didn't answer your message earlier, I was busy.
Join us.
I swear to God I didn't kill Tom.
Ignorance is the mother of fear as well as of admiration.
I was happy when you were here.
Andrés eats a chocolate at the chocolatier.
She looked like she'd seen a ghost.
I think he's American.

I'm so glad to be here.
He put his hands in his pockets.
Let's walk?
I'm going shopping tomorrow.
"I think we should go"."Me too".
What?
Passengers must not talk to the driver while the bus is in motion.
The princess was eaten by a shark.
Do you want me to come to Japan to see you?

Tom tried to hug Mary.
He always wanted to study Japanese.
Why are you in such a hurry?
Please forgive me for asking such a personal question.

"How old are you?""I'm sixteen".
You're two years younger than Tom.
Let's think about the worst that could happen.
Tell Tom I'm ready to go.
We have few opportunities to speak German.
The girl was busy making tea for her friend.
Dolphins and whales aren't fish.
I need you to keep quiet.
When is dinner?
She goes to night school.
The sad story made us cry.
Never imagined she was so smart.
Where did you spend your vacation?
It's raining again.
Let's play hide and seek.
John is the same age as my brother.
It's not such a big deal. You worry too much.
There's nothing wrong with sleeping late on Sundays.
You're a really good guitarist.
Can you see the difference?
Tom likes to study music.
They made me mad.
I'd rather have a cat than a dog.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
It's like a dream come true.
He's 12 years old. He's tall for his age.
How long have you been learning English?

I don't like his nose.
Whatever your heart says, he never lies.

What kind of vegetables do you want to buy?
He has abandoned his duties.
️This tea is too bitter.
What are you looking at?
There's a restaurant here where I eat often.
"I think we should go"."Me too".

Get the keys to your car.
Maria became pregnant at the age of fourteen.
