This not only confirms that there were feathered dinosaurs, a widespread theory, but that there are generally no usable fossils of evidence, for example of three-dimensional colors and shapes.
The scientists say that the animal's fur is brown-peened on the upper and white or light-colored on the lower sides.
The findings also provide insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed scales, called rachis, but had other feather-like characteristics  spines and spider veins  researchers concluded that rachis was a possible next evolutionary development of those characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather to regulate temperature or appearance.
Researchers suggest that although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples showed adult and not a frog's fur.
A car bomb at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others early on Monday.

In France, voting has traditionally been a technologically fragile experience: voters isolate themselves in a room, handing out a pre-printed piece of paper showing their preferred candidates inside an envelope.
After the official has verified the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope inside the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Since 1988, ballot boxes must be clear so that voters and supervisors can check that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the election and that no envelopes are added except those of the officially valid and counted voters.

Adekoya has since appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his daughter.
He was remanded in custody pending charges and trial, but the evidence against him could also be unclear as his photographs have been circulated.
This is a common practice in England but the law is different in Scotland and the courts have ruled that the photographs are harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee noted that "publishing the suspect's photographs would be extremely dangerous for journalists".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least as far as the indictment
The document, according to rumors that have emerged, would address the issue of restrictions, which were sought by the Palestinians under the restrictions before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics reportedly discussed include the future of a Jerusalem that is sacred to all nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded the arrival of the landing squadron in the valley within ten years after the agreement was signed when the PA agreed to leave the presence for only five years.
The participants in pest control trials should be closely monitored by the supervisor, as these trials are monitored and evaluated.
In partnership with the National Sports Council of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are recruited under the Sports Council's grants program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage Parks with NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received full safety instructions and training.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Council of Provisional Elections (CEP) yesterday.
This was Martelly's fourth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the CEP's early resignation as part of a package of measures to bring the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were sparked by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods becoming unusable due to overheating have been reported, causing six fires and injuring four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Industry and Trade (METI) says there have been at least 27 accidents involving the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple was reporting 34 additional heat-related accidents, which the company called "serious".
The ministry responded by saying that the report by Apple was "really worthy of concern".
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 local time (09.19 Friday night GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said that no injuries were reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino police officer holds a Hong Kong tourist hostage by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza introduced the M16 to the tourists.
Some of the hostages were released and at least six are presumed dead so far.
Six detainees, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took the place of an old woman when she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While she was working at the hospital Liggins began to investigate premature births during her time off.
The study showed that the hormone given to the fetus would shorten the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" of flight recorders on Wednesday.
The gulet friends also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna died on the afternoon of two moons. She was very unique like her. Strong woman.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that Luna is the same person I am...maybe even more so...love and miss her (her)...hopefully she is in a better place.
Of the total 1,400 people who voted in the 2010 federal election, all those who disagreed whether Australia should become a republic rose by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard acknowledged during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth's reign.
34 per cent of the voters want Queen Elizabeth II to be the youngest monarch in Australia.
At the end of the week, 29 percent of those polled believed Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist will swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but her relative abilities are in doubt.
He is currently unable to take medication to cope with his illness as it is forbidden in the Match.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known until January 25.
Some people tested the invention using different software and hardware in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists are eager to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth is formed, because in the past comets have collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and has signed off on the same-sex marriage demands.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA demands will allow cars to fly on shorter lanes and save hundreds of millions of gallons of fuel per year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to show aircraft with higher accuracy and provide pilots with more complete information.
No additional transport is carried out and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and car parking and parking-and-ride facilities are not available on the mainland.
Fears of a shortage of vehicles increased the likelihood that the game would have to be run on the streets without the support of the patrons.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Studies from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species breed for only two generations, although this method is believed to be longer, due to the overlap between the endemic Darwin's finch, the Geospiza castle, and the captive finch cactus, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be made into any shape. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be made of very thin wire, which can be shredded and grafted.
It can be made very thin, and adheres to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to enclose the hand-painted image in a book called ornamented manuscript.
This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice depends on how acidic or alkaline the chemical compounds are.
This pH level is characterized by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton whose electrons are removed (because a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Rub two drying powders together and then, with a clean hand, crush it into a ball.
The moisture in your hand will be absorbed by the outer layer, which will make it look funny and give it a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have a flat toilet in almost every house, which is connected to a modern waste disposal system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets were also in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, the toilet was sometimes part of a public bathhouse where men and women mingled together.
When you're talking to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite is in space getting a call and then bouncing this thing off, almost instantly.
Satellites are sent into space by rockets. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere deflects some of the light and reflects it on itself.
It takes a huge rocket 100 feet high to lift a satellite or a telescope into the sky.
Wheels have changed the world in a great way. The biggest thing is that they have created vehicles that are easy to use and also fast.
This has given us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Sangisore is a medium-sized cat that eats medium-sized game from the hen to the fox and the chick.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat smaller prey such as insects, mice, lizards, and birds.
The key to his success is the concept of position, a special creation that each cat has that prevents cats from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called pride.
This group of lions consists of one to three adult male lions, with as many as thirty female and cub lions.
Female lions are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs act like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are more like lions (but not other big cats) in appearance, and are also more deadly to their prey.
A highly skilled athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances and crawl with the strength of five men.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The lion's roar is not like the roar of a lion with its full voice, but it is like a fearful speech and a roar of words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, and will catch bats, snakes, rats and birds if they can, but almost all animals they hunt are smaller than they are.
Scientists think that the ocelot cat followed and also found the animal to be eaten (for a time) by its smell, scavenging its place where there was dirt.
They can see in the dark with night vision, and can also move silently.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separates from the main population in which they originated (such as if they migrated across a mountain range or river, or if they migrated to a new island so that they could not move there easily) they will often find themselves in a different environment than where they were before.
These new neighborhoods have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need a different look or adaptation to become a stronger competitor than was required before.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same training as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environment they are similar, they are beginning to look different and not like other populations.
Eventually, after a few thousand or millions of years, the two populations will look very different and cannot be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means a new form of a species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans ingest, and take up the carbon dioxide that humans expel (i.e., breathe).
Trees make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals cannot live.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are covered with over 70 thin teeth, and with extra teeth on top of its lips, it has no way out of anything that might be blocking its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that the two-legged gull feeds on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and possibly its own kind.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex would not be its equal.
While almost all of their cooking would have been common to them, the Romans did have some odd or unusual food items including, wild boar, peacocks, geese, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
The difference is that the poor man and woman eat their food sitting on a chair, the rich man likes to eat together where they sit together while eating their food.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they all had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no chocolate, and no ancient Romans ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a major temple to their gods that they considered to be the home of the gods.
People will bring offerings to the gods and the priests will attempt to cater to the needs of the gods through ceremonies or festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then the inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes the pyramid-shaped cuscus towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shelter for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not a priority.
Many Hebrew families lived outside of their territory.
Women perform the mangsak in the backyard; the stalls are merely open tables of merchants that overlook the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily wooded, so the wood was very expensive.
In Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for killing people, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But no matter how they found it, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country is Skandinavia, there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think of the treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But even if it is written on the back of a letter, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence is inscribed on the back with the words The Declaration of Independence Official 4 July 1776, which appears in reverse on the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) were rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is highly likely that the notes were added only for the sake of labelling.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was led by a Frenchman "Vichy". He was a Frenchman who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked for the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, in what was called OPeration Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces successfully liberated southern France and returned to Germany.
A civilization is a single custom that is held by a large group of people who live and work together, namely the people.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning population, and civitas, meaning city or urban condition, which is how one can define the size of a society.
The City State is the precursor of the State. The culture of civilization implies the inheritance of cross-generational insights, lasting cultural traces and equitable distribution.
Small civilizations often disappear without any historical evidence of their connection and fail to be recognized as the civilization they were supposed to be.
During the Revolutionary War, the first thirteen states formed a weak central government with Congress as the only component under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress has no power to impose taxes, and, because there is no national executive or judiciary, relies on the state government, which is often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
It also has no authority to raise taxes and prices between states.
All members of the Council must agree to the Article before it can be amended and the other members of the Council consider the existing government to be weak because its representatives are too often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team is the second most successful team in the world and the winner of the FIFA world cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, fencing, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey and F1 motor racing.
The winter sport is most popular in the North, with Italy participating in international and Olympic events.
Japan occupies nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
The existence of island groups in Japan, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "island" country
Taiwan began in the 15th century when European fishermen passed by and named the island Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.where
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a base in the south of Taiwan, which began a transformation in the indigenous seed-production practices and recruited Chinese laborers to work in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Candles.
Many of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of the initial things hence.
By 1976, thirty percent of Macchu Picchu had been restored and continued to be restored to the present day.
For example, the common still image photographic format in the world is 35mm, where it was the dominant film size in the late analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
35mm is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm and 24mm wide.
The aspect ratio of this format (shaped like a twelve to produce the simplest numerical ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
More common formats (e.g., formats of the APS family) are similar or close to this aspect ratio.
The third rule that is most often mentioned is a simple guide to creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of order within the image.
This suggests that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see for example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, entered a period of scrutiny.
Over a thousand years ago, Christianity united the nations of Europe despite their language and culture.
This is all about the power that affects everyone from the king to me.
One of the principles of Christianity is that money should be used to help people in need and that church money is there for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for a thousand years and this concentration of power and money caused many to wonder whether this principle had been followed.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, the British began a naval blockade against Germany.
This policy proved to be powerful, and manced important military and civilian supplies, although the siege violated generally accepted international law as governed by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
The British laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the sea, endangering neutral shipping.
Since there was a limited response to this plan, the Germans expected a response similar to the unlimited submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the actions of the citizens and the nation were against war and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and cruelty of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a future war.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States because he accepted a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager of his previous endeavor) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had an unusual way of referring to the era; each level of China or each powerful family was its own dynasty.
The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin Dynasties.
This fierce battle took place when many noble blood was stripped of the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China as thousands of dead men fought for the highest seats in the great palace of Xian.
There were many influences from social and political conditions such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belonged to all people and not just to a single ruler.
Also after the Revolution the job was opened to all male applicants allowing for the most ambitious and successful men to have an outcome.
The same applies to the military because the ranks of soldiers as they were were based on their class were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often went to the cave now known as the Hira Cave on Mount Noor (light) for meditation.
His own cave, which survived him, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know what it is.
The only thing that can be touched is the beautiful, clear skies above and the many mountains around them.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Dead Valley has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family.
The "high arrow" mark looks like a V-letter and the "low arrow" mark like a staples fill or a missing bottom box.
Up means you have to start from the top and push the lever, and down means you have to start from the forks (where your hand is holding the lever) and pull the lever.
An arc above this notation usually results in a softer sound, and a check mark below it usually results in a stronger, more emphatic sound.
Do not hesitate to write in your own sign, but remember the curved corner markings that are due to the music, so they usually have to be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoniette and their two younger sons (Marie Theresa aged 11 and Louis Charles aged four) and the King's sister, Lady Elizabeth, who was pregnant, were on 6 October 1789 forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In the carriage, he returned to Paris surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and spoke insults against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the chandeliers of their large chariot.
At one point, a member of the society pokes fun at the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles in front of the angry queen.
The cost of the war of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes on the U.S. colonial government to finance the country's massive purchases and floating interest bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the huge profits derived from their long exploitation of the Filipino people will be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that drove them to create the order.
The High Middle Ages was a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300)
The High Middle Ages are preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which according to convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a phrase that refers to many things in the mind to practice, from the support of technology or the technology that must exist to the strong sense that the destiny of humanity is supported by the mind that is fundamentally linked to the scientific rule and its manifestations to technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two common views: that technological development itself follows a path that is generally free of cultural or political influence, and that the technology itself has "effects" on the society as a whole, rather than being conditioned by social conditions.
For example, some might say that a machine is the first human to build a road.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for only a few cars, so new production methods were developed to reduce the cost of driving a car.
Mass car ownership also led to more accidents on the roads, which created new techniques for maintaining the health and repairing damaged car bodies.
The romantic literary style had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged, and these, in accordance with the space of society, were preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern era, Constantinople is considered to be the fashion capital of Europe of ancient times.
Famous for its expensive and fine-art equipment from about 400 A.D. and lasting until about 1100 A.D.
Its status was denied in the twelfth century due to the fact that Crusaders returned with goods such as silk and embroidery that were worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
At that time the movement of the Fashion Capital from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th - 11th and the 14th centuries.
Early dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east
However, due to slow communication channels, western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the results of this change was the result of the crusades when many people began to use the bun to tighten their clothing.
Swasembada farming is the farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Live-farming is a simple, often organic, method of using seeds that are native to the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or a simple way to increase the yield.
As a result, most farmers are engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Cultural isolation leaves one with like-minded people who feel ignored by social hierarchies and can create a sense of identity.
Cultural branches may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a branch of culture may be linguistic, aesthetic, related to religion, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural chain often mark their membership by using distinct and symbolic styles, which include dress, behavior, and dialect.
One of the most commonly used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take advantage of the disadvantaged cases of children who, ignored, neglected, abused, intentionally abused, were not talked to by peers in childhood.
Some children are locked up by people (usually their parents); in some cases, these children are abandoned because of their parents' refusal to allow them to suffer severe intellectual or physical damage.
The child may have been abused as a child or may have been afraid of being abandoned or of running away.
Others are thought to have been brought by animals; some are said to live alone in the wild.
When treated by non-human animals, the child exhibits wild behavior (with certain limitations) almost as much as in the treatment of primates, such as fear and even hostility towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a supporting aid that provides a person with a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding but also a small paperclip that is in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in software and is aimed at asking, asking, and explaining in ways that can challenge students to handle it themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and coercion.
No child should grow up in an uncaring, neglectful and uneducational environment, but he does.
We feel that the Child Protection System is a safety zone for these children.
A warehouse should provide a safe home, loving companions, regular maintenance, and reliable sanitary warehouses.
The child care must meet all the needs that are lacking in the home that were taken from the children before.
The Internet combines elements of group and interpersonal communication.
The different characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in the terminology of its use and approach to gratification.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed to be important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuous engagement were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has resulted in important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last several milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that one can detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting the micro-expression.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess the sincerity of their hearts.
He even showed that such abilities in the course of human behavior could be possessed by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twenty-century research has shown that there are two sets of genetic sex: hidden and revealed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes this from the group of variations it expresses.
Segregation and random sex recombination alternate between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a human-like digestive system to meet their amino acid needs from readily available plant sources.
What is more, such failure can lead to serious consequences: depression, malnutrition, and death.
The most accessible plant source is protein, which is readily available in leaves and pods, but is difficult for primates such as humans to digest unless the plant is cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, shell, egg) are not only easily digested, but they provide high quality protein that contains all the necessary amino acids.
In hindsight, we should not be surprised that our ancestors dealt with the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep disorder is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleeping hours and returning to sleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes)
This can be easily done by using a slightly slanted cup clock that can make you conscious without waking you up to a shock.
If you find yourself setting a birthday clock in your bed, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up from the spot to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of water (especially water or tea, known as to pass a lot of urine) before going to bed, forcing people to get up to urinate.
The more inner peace a person has, the more he is physically and mentally strong.
The closer you get to marriage, the better the quality of life you have.
The only thing that stands in the way of this pursuit is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddhist teachings, but developed by the path of mahayana love and by all the methods of Indian Yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, including Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path to embrace all love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is raised through yoga poses, breathing, mantras and reflections.
The center of Tibetan meditation is God Yoga. Through the visualization of various gods, the energy strings are cleansed, the chakras are turned on and pancracy consciousness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War 2, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures led to the collapse of the countries.
With the end of the war two years ago, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and it will be fought with determination, by the armies in power, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the base of the Romanian bridge.
However, this plan was made overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian troops after the brutal invasion of eastern Poland by the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, all bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to move goods is the most cost-effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the sea.
The job of a navy traditionally has been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, but at the same time, interfere with your enemy to get them to move people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic military operation for World War II. The Americans attempted to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, attempted to halt their movement.
If the Allies failed, Germany might have been able to defeat Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
The goat appears to have been first brutally domesticated 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to maintain easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
The sheep are generally kept in groups of animals that roam in the dunes or other areas, often tended by shepherds who are often children or teenagers, almost identical to the commonly known shepherds.
The carriage road was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the grourbag rail consists only of parallel wooden boards, it can make the horse pull the grourbag to be able to go faster and pull a larger load than on a slightly rougher road.
Rail bearings were introduced early on to hold rails in place, but over time it was realised that rails would be more efficient if they had iron on top.
This became common practice, but later led to more widespread use of wooden carriage wheel parts.
Eventually, the wooden wheel was replaced by an iron wheel.
The first known vehicles to walk were humans, who began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (the upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus did not walk upright on a daily basis.
Two-legged walking was found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs rapidly during the last seven million years.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be a leader in reducing our future footprint to some degree.
It's just symptomatic in many cases, but if we want more than a temporary solution, then we have to find the source of the problem, and we have to stop it altogether.
It is clear that the world has changed a lot due to the advancement of human science and technology, and the problems are getting bigger due to the excess population and the wasteful lifestyle of humans.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson and sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's print shop.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap spread.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which was read to the troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
25 Dunlap's only known surviving pamphlet is a complete copy of his document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people have argued that this animal is not a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
But there are still many parts of the bird that look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay their eggs, and they walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information created by coding with a pair of twin-digit strings.
Twin numbers can have only one or two ranks, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are called twin digits - or bits, which is computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent, and signs such as mucus are common and therefore an immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The most obvious sign of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of drugs or a dry chemical containing the poison.
Check the label for a first-aid kit for that specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in the official sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from an ancient association with the bed bug, which is a highly adaptable insect that becomes a parasite of humans.
The killer duck and the mattress duck are both altricial, adapting to life in the foster or homestead of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a well-known neurological disease for both middle-aged and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
The couple can decide whether it is in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise the baby.
The couple decided to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the adoptive parents terminate their parental rights so that the other spouse may become the child's parent.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works by the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
Not only that, testing, and experimentation are methods used to dismiss one or more possible hypotheses, raise questions, and make observations as well as guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to ancient writings and, especially, to the Gospels in Latin.
Aristotle's views are acceptable for all fields of science, including psychology.
As Greek science declined, the West emerged from the Greek yo-yo scientifically and philosophically.
Many observations of rhythms in physiology and behavior often rely heavily on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic vibration, not simply a response to external periodicity, has been proven to be true for most living creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue its free-flowing time even without external cues.
Harshey and Chase's experiment was one of the key elements in the idea that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used a phage, or virus, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They double-examine the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, meaning the genetic material affected and what cells are affected are germ-line cells.
Only mutations inside the cells of multicellular organisms can be passed on to their offspring, and mutations elsewhere can cause cancer or cell death.
Nature-based parks can attract many people who want to take a trip into nature with the aim of observing the sights, including the trees as well as wildlife.
Examples of camping in places include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and exploring ecosystems.
For example visit, take photos, and learn about the organgatuangs in Borneo.
Each morning, people leave the small town in their cars to go to their workplaces and meet the people who work there.
In this dynamic transportation to-and-from, everyone is learning how to connect to, and support, a transportation system based on private cars.
Current knowledge suggests that this vast carbon economy has depleted the biosphere of one of the solid states that have supported human civilization for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system.
In developed countries, you very rarely hear the same complaints about the quality of water or bridges.
Why do people complain about the transportation system, why does it fail every day, is the transportation engineer incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with one another.
It is very difficult to study the traffic flow because the driver's habits cannot be distinguished with precision.
Fortunately, condo drivers behave fairly regularly; therefore, condo traffic flows have understandable and mathematically demonstrable congruence.
To better illustrate traffic density, relationships have been established between three main states: (1) density, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in the planning, design and operation of highway facilities.
The reptiles were among the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to get away from enemies more easily and to find food and mate more easily.
Most insects have long benefited from the ability to fold their wings around their backs.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are bats and batsflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
How many people think they are free but many people believe otherwise; that the Solar System revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It makes sense, because the earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world.
The Amazon is also the largest river in the world, with a width of six miles.
The Amazon provides 20 percent of the water that flows out of the planet's rivers and into the oceans.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid building using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Pyramids of Giza never surpassed in size and sophistication the methods of their construction.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt was fascinated by the monuments of its ancestors, which then remained intact for over a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the world's smallest independent state and the country with the least population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and communications.
Italian was also the language of many of the people who worked in this area and Latin was often used for religious ceremonies.
All the people who live in Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the properties of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature in their native forms and are fairly easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything in the universe was made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is almost the same as the problem of the four states of matter (in the same way): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it also assumes that they transform into new matter to form what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You can also have alloys that have small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is so small that billions of atoms could fit in a dot at the end of this sentence.
Then, the pencil was a good companion for many people when they went out.
However, as new ways of writing have emerged, the pencil has been downgraded to a shorter condition and use.
People are now writing messages on computer screens, never having to come closer to get closer.
One can only wonder what became of the typewriter when something newer came along.
Fusion bombs are sparked by the principle that energy is required to combine a nucleus that has many protons and neutrons.
It's like lifting a heavy rock up a hill, and it breaks the nucleus of the rock and releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means that they tend to break up with little or no impulse.
The Moon's surface is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The candle sparkle is about 70 km on the near side and the candle 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under maria and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more maria on the sides because the crust is thinner.
Content theory is central to discovering what makes people choose or be attracted to something.
The theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or desires that are already internalized when they enter adulthood.
These theories observe what is with certain people that causes them to want what they do and what things in their environment will cause them to do or not do certain actions.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two actions can be seen when a manager starts leading his former teammates. One of the peaks of the spectrum is keeping a close eye on one of his (male) (or female) teammates.
Managers of this type have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking orderly actions, respecting their work, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a morph becomes an unrecognized individual who feels he (the male) or she (the female) must change everything the group has done and make it his own.
After all, the leader is the one who has the ultimate responsibility for the success and performance of the team.
This often creates a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual squads have the same benchmarks of excellence as conventional squads, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for the immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular squad members because they are able to meet with different time zones that may not be familiar to the ground staff.
The existence of an implied invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team in which each member reports.
Why do associations want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a teaching association?
If all available resources are used with good results in all functional parts of the organization, creativity and excellence can take place.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new process of innovation to serve the needs of the subscriber.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation and also be able to share knowledge and ways of learning in an organizational way.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum method as a practice used to help groups achieve higher employment.
Neurobiological data provide a real case for how to prove the theory of consciousness checking.
The relationship between neuroscience and behavior supports scientists to investigate.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause reversal of some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate the workings and processes in the brain that were previously unknown.
It also provides us with a wealth of information and material to build models of the brain that help us understand how our minds work.
Although it has a strong connotation of science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and adaptation of intelligence within a machine.
Research on AI is beyond creating machines to perform tasks automatically that require intelligent action.
Examples include control, design and statement, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
That's how it has become a different discipline, one that focuses on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, machinery and food, as they are built into many home computer devices and gaming applications.
Field school was an important part of the class, and teachers would often take their students to places where buses could not pass.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or marvel at the beauty of nature while sitting with their classmates.
Field trip sharing is also a way to describe a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina create a web about their trip to the State Capital, each year the web is changed, but the old version remains online so that it can be used as a template book.
Blogs can also help to improve the writing skills of students. Although students often start their blogging experience with confusing grammar and spelling, the presence of readers often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, bloggers began to try to improve their writing to avoid being criticized.
Blogging also encourages students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to encourage the curiosity of visitors inspires students to be active and fun (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to communicate well outside of the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can empower students to become more critical and critical; by actively responding to Internet material, students can identify themselves in the context of other people's writing and articulate their own views on a particular issue (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's capital city, and is a vibrant, bilingual city that offers a collection of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
To the south is Niagara Falls and to the north is an area of untapped natural beauty from Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and more highlight Ontario as what is considered quintessentially Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas of the north are sparsely populated and some are vast forests that are almost uninhabited.
For a population comparison that shocks many: African Americans living in America outnumber Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island, and the continent is unique in the animal world it contains.

Women: It is advisable to tell a woman who is traveling to say that she is married, regardless of what their marital status actually is.
This helps to also use ali-ali (but only if they look expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to rebound and that they are not used to being followed, held in the arms, etc.
That means rejecting men, and don't be afraid to shout it out loud in your neighborhood (culturally or not, it doesn't do any good!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the building and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it again after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who were able to build a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine, porcelain, leather goods, pipes, and geegaw paintings of everything, but that's only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried many of the towns and streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is generally safe, any tension outside of Goma should be studied to understand the constant state of war in North Kivu Province.
It is also the base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo along with hiking trails in search of Africa's lowest mountain gorilla.
You can use a boda-boda (bike taxi) to get to Goma.
Combined with the state of being excluded from contact, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metonym for a beautiful and remote place.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though it is a popular tourist destination, and has a port.
In 1990, the list of World Heritage sites to be protected was increased, due to the threat of the sands in the sand dunes.

The Sundarban is the world's largest belt of coastal rainforest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) into Bangladesh and the Indian interior from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But it is not only the mangrove swamp, it is also some of the last remnants of the mangrove forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water.
Since 1966 Sundarban has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that about 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 rattlesnakes are seen in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-county bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although almost all, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06.30 and 07.30.

The bridge is 15 metres (55 ft) in length, and was completed in August 2011, but not opened to the public until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully opened in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous group that currently live in what is today Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic gremas who also subsist on agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuru and the Payagua, who lived by hunting, farming and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called the "Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the conflict between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the formation of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve many of its indigenous identities and character.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.

The official Falkland currency is the Falkland pound (PFK) which is defined as the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British Pounds are generally accepted wherever there is a bank on the island and Stanley credit cards and United States dollars are often accepted.
In remote islands credit cards. may not be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted; ask the owner first to determine what payment methods are accepted.
It is not possible to exchange Falklands currency throughout the island, so you must exchange currency before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical area; during the dry season, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "rain" and "dry" seasons: the total rainfall is constantly about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are familiar to humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's superintendent, keep at least 100 yards/ meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/ meter away from all wild animals!
Despite their appearance, bison, elk, big-game deer, and deer, bears, and all large animals can attack.
Dozens of tourists fall and are injured each year because of their close proximity to the giant, wild, and dangerous animal.
For added value, be careful as this fragrance can attract bears and other wild animals, so do not bring or cook food with strong smells and take care to keep your environment clean.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a catch-all term that encompasses many types of regional cuisines found in a single country.
However, if used without further qualification, this term would imply that this dish is originally from east and central Java.
Now available in all regions of the archipelago, Javanese cuisine provides many types of simple dishes, the additional flavor favored by Javanese is beans, squash, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and other aromatic desserts.
The gurdi is a body for the rider's feet that rests on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but may be a concern because the rider's feet can still get trapped there.
If a rider falls off a horse but has one foot caught in the saddle, they can be caught if the horse runs off. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
That first time, all riders wore boots for riding that had a soft sole and a narrow turf.
Next, some carpets, especially British carpets, have safety bars that allow the leather to fall off the carpet if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - the main mountain climbing range in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its various large walls of granite and coral.
Climbers from all parts of the world continue to forge new paths among the endless potential of the rim.
Downhill skiing, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves skiing underground covered in snow with a ski equipment or snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "skiing buddies", planning their entire vacation around skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Skiing on the slopes as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related but not usually carried out in the style of mountain skiing or mountaineering, which is done on steep terrain and requires more rigid skiing equipment and shoes.
Think of the ski trail as the same as the climb.
In ideal conditions you will be able to travel farther than you would on foot - but it is rare that you will achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on a well-kept trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls repeatedly.
The Schengen area, however, runs such a country there is this thing.
