This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers (this theory is already widespread) but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish-brown above with a pale or carotenoid underbelly.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed beak called a rachis, but have other features - rays and hooks - researchers have concluded that rachis probably evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display, and scientists speculate that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and not a calf.
Scientists speculate that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, it represents a specimen of the adult animal's feathers, not the dusty feathers of the young.

Based on the luminosity and rotation, the Rossby number of the star is determined, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic rotation.

The work was mostly theoretical, but a program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The team was looking for a phenomenon that would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a force on the Earth and causes sea level rise and fall, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is around the galaxy in a kind of "glowing star" and is made up of lots of small particles.

They are colder by day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
Their temperature changes are not as stable as those of the great caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but this is consistent with the fact that they are deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the astrogeological team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.
In France, voting is traditionally conducted without modern technology: voters isolate themselves in a booth and place a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope stating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter will drop the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voter roll.
The French electoral code contains a rather strict codification of the electoral process.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes were in them before the vote began and that no envelopes other than those put in by the counting and authorization of voters were added.
Candidates can send representatives to witness the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists may be walking on thin ice if they publish photos of suspects.
The prosecutor's office, which is in charge of prosecuting the case, has made it clear to reporters that no further information will be provided at least until charges are brought.
According to the leak, the document will address a border dispute in which Palestine wants to preserve the borders as they were before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics included the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters were under close surveillance by rangers during the Pest Control Study as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In cooperation with the NPSW and NSW Inc (Australian Shooting Sports Association), qualified volunteers were recruited under the auspices of the association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shot received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday at the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission presented Martelly's response to the massive anti-government protests that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, and some have been ongoing since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of faulty iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four deaths from minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan reported that it was aware of 27 equipment-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents that the company had labeled "somewhat serious".
The Ministry responded by calling Apple's delay "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck in the Marianas at 7:19 local time (Friday 20:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were soon released, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later replaced the elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he began to work on preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that when the hormone is given, it accelerates the maturation of the fetal lungs.
The Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two black boxes with flight records on Wednesday.
His fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extremes, my first manager, Luna died during the night when there were two moons in the sky, unique as she was, she was a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said Luna was as crazy as I was... maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's somewhere better.
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
As for the extreme views in the survey, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and triple relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his eligibility was questioned due to his objections.
He couldn't take the medicine he needed to relieve the pain, because drugs are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
The discovery was verified by various hardware and software providers in early February, and announced on Tuesday.
Comets can be a source of water on Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how the earth formed after a comet hit the earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and recklessness".
There is speculation that he will seek the presidency in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel and reducing carbon emissions each year.
Compared to ground-based radar technology, it uses satellite technology, which enables air traffic controllers to detect aircraft with greater accuracy and provides pilots with more precise information.
No emergency transport will be introduced, no overhead railway will be built at Wembley, no parking or park-and-ride facilities will be available on site.
Concerns about lack of transportation have increased the chances that the game will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved in just two generations, although the process was thought to take much longer, because of the breeding between endemic finches, Darwin's medium finches, and migratory cactus and conifer finches.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes, rolled into tiny pieces.
It can be pulled out into a thin wire that can be bent and twisted, and it can be crushed or pressed into sheets.
It can be worked into a considerably thin form and fixed to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it has often been used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make an indicator yourself with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH value is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had electrons removed from them (because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then use your clean, wet hands to make a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will result in a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in ancient Rome, toilets were sometimes part of public baths that were shared by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using satellite to make a call.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces its signal back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere partially distorts our light and visual field.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, you need a large rocket that measures over 100 feet.
The wheel has changed the world in unprecedented ways, but most importantly, it has made transportation much easier and faster.
He brought us a train, a car, and other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized feline predators that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including wild domestic cats) whose main diet consists of small prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the ecological niche system, where each cat has its own tasks that prevent it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called packs.
The pack consists of one to three adult male relatives, along with up to 30 females and young.
The females are usually closely related and represent a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
The tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same genus as the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion from a full throat, but rather a phrase of sharp, shouted words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate prey by smell, which helps them to identify where they have been on the ground.
They have excellent night vision and can move very quietly, and they hunt by merging with their environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they come (for example, when they cross a mountain range or a river or move to a new island from which it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than in the past.
The original population hasn't changed at all, still needing the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they start to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, in a few thousand or even millions of years, these two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe out.
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so he was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were covered with over 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set planted on the top floor, meaning nothing that crossed its path had a chance of escaping.
We don't know for sure, but they may have had a cleft tongue, and their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have been cannibals.
They also attacked anything that entered the water, even large dinosaurs like T. rex, which were no match for them.
While most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of peculiar or unusual feasting arrangements, including game, peacock, snail, and a rodent called the plch.
Another difference was that women and poor people ate their meals sitting on chairs, while rich men enjoyed feasting together and eating on their sides.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that reached Europe from the Americas or Asia until later centuries.
They had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests sought to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and celebrations.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkurates were built as part of temples.
At the top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no extensive forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Despite its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although all countries were part of Scandinavia, there were many differences between the people, the king, the customs and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Treasure Hunters, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence had a treasure map drawn on it.
Although the document has something written on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence are the words Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776.
Although the author is not known for certain, it is clear that the large parchment document (sizes 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up and stored shortly after its creation.
It is therefore likely that the entry was simply added as a sticker.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles brought the liberation of northern France, but the south of the country was not yet liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invading forces instead of fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and turned on Germany.
A civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, that is, together they form a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and it's related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and also civitas, meaning city or city-state, and it also defines the size of society in a way.
The ancestors of nations were city-states. The culture of a civilization is characterized by the transmission of knowledge over several generations, the presence of long-lasting cultural traces and adequate dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government with Congress as its sole component, subject to the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and with no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on government agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce laws.
Nor did it have any power to abolish tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states and could only be amended afterward, and the states took the central government lightly, so much so that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and in 2006 Italy won the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, inline hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic trials.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands, and the largest of these is Honshu, making Japan actually the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is sometimes called an "island" in a geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of its original grain-producing practices by employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the southwestern and northern coasts of Taiwan, and in 1885 Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main piers: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the buildings originally looked like.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35mm, which was the most common film size at the height of the analogue film era.
They are still being made today, but more importantly, their aspect ratios have also taken over the formats of digital camera sensors.
Although it's a bit confusing, the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio in integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The often abused and derided rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamics in the picture while maintaining a certain order.
According to this specification, the most efficient location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having gained wealth and power, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European nations despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's financial resources are there for that very purpose.
The centralization of church authority in Rome for over 1,000 years led many to question whether this principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the fighting broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international agreements from the previous two centuries.
Britain crossed international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, posing a danger even to neutral ships.
As this tactic met only a limited response, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited underwater military force.
During the 1920's, pacifist and isolationist attitudes prevailed among most citizens and nations.
As they witnessed the horror and cruelty of World War I, the nations yearned to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation for Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his former supervisor).
Ancient China had a unique way of distinguishing between different time periods; each era of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There were also unstable periods of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms Period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Qing dynasties.
During these periods, a ruthless war was fought between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died fighting for the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism and nationalism, or the belief that the land belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true in the military, where instead of ranking based on class, it now depends on ability.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed workers from other countries to try to start a revolution in their own countries.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters outside the realm of secular life, and he often visited a cave known as Hira on a mountain called Noor (light) and contemplated there.
The cave itself, which has survived a considerable time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual orientation.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you knew it existed.
There is nothing to see but a beautifully clear sky and a large number of surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Kings includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The upward slide looks like a V and the downward slide looks like a clamp or a square with a missing bottom.
Up means you start at the tip and you press the loop, down means you start at the frog (where the hand holds the loop) and you pull the loop.
Moving upward usually produces a softer sound, while moving downward is louder and more penetrating.
You can write your own markings in the sheet, but keep in mind that the printed markings have a musical purpose and should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Theresa and 4 years old Louis-Charles) and the King's sister Elizabeth the French were forced to return from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, which surrounded the riotous crowd, shouting threats to the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to leave their chariot windows wide open.
At one point in Versailles, a member of a criminal gang waved the head of the royal guard at the horrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, while the interest on the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banking houses on Wall Street.
The extra surplus value from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would, of course, be the basic revenue of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which most people believe ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas: for example, the so-called technology pusch or technological imperative, or the belief that human fate is governed by all-encompassing logic along with scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an impact on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that when motor cars appear, it necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But the national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, which causes new techniques to be invented in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism carried a significant element of cultural determinism drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geographically formed individuals and over time there was the emergence of customs and cultures associated with this geography and these, because they were in line with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily enforced laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion center of the modern world, Constantinople was known as the fashion center of feudal Europe.
Its glory as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its importance declined during the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders carried back to Europe valuables, such as silk and spices, which were more expensive at home than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was significantly influenced by Byzantine culture.
But because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and one of the greatest advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started to use buttons to tie their clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is farming carried out to produce only the amount of food that meets the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system using seed native to a given ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership through expressive and symbolic use of style, which includes dress, behavior, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or intentional abuse, were not socialized as adults growing up.
Some werewolf cubs were imprisoned for long periods of time (usually by their own parents), in some cases living in abandonment because their parents rejected them because of their severe mental or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma, and then been abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised as animals, while some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
In complete non-human animal rearing, a feral child exhibits almost identical behaviour (within the limits of physical capabilities) to that of a caring animal, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
The skeleton is not a teaching method but rather a tool that provides support to those individuals who undergo the acquisition of a new practice, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it's also a little clutch in Microsoft Office.
The software incorporates Virtual Constructing to analyse, motivate and explain procedures that might be too difficult for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where he or she does not receive proper nutrition, care, and education.
We believe the foster care system will be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving foster care, stable education and reliable health care.
The purpose of foster care is to provide for all needs that were not met in the household from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet add another dimension in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are proposed as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement and continuing interest were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-messages  facial movements lasting only a few microseconds.
Specifically, by correctly interpreting microexpressions, you can tell if someone is lying to you.
Oliver Sacks in his article The President's Speech suggested how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two areas of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination blend in both directions the differences between the two sets within each generation.
For primates with digestive systems similar to humans, it is difficult to meet the need for amino acids from plant sources available in the open savannah.
If they do not, the consequences are serious: depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant sources would be protein available in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for us, as for primates, to digest unless cooked.
In contrast, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digested but also provides a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors tackled the protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking from normal sleep and falling asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily accomplished by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without completely waking you.
If you find yourself turning off your alarm clock, you can place it on the opposite side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces a person to get up and go to the toilet.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the level of tension in his body and mind.
The less stress, the more good the life force brings, and every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only thing that stands in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was extended by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are basically very simple, they are kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened by the yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga, through which the visualization of various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really fought with proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defenses had been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and regrouping of forces along the Romanian frontier.
But these plans were realized almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the soldiers invaded the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transport is by far the most efficient way to transport large amounts of people and cargo across the ocean.
The traditional task of the navy was to ensure the ability of the state to transport people and goods, but at the same time the navy was also to prevent the enemy from transporting its own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was trying to stop this activity, mainly by using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, then Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures and were often guarded by shepherds, often children or adolescents like the better-known shepherds of sheep.
Horse-drawn tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways usually consisted of only parallel planks, they allowed the draught horses to reach higher speeds and carry heavier loads than on other roads of the time, which were somewhat rougher.
Although railway sleepers were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, it was gradually found that the rails were more effective when they had an iron belt on their surface.
This became commonplace, but the iron caused the wooden wheels of the wagons to wear out more.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, with humans beginning to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestor, Australopithecus, did not normally walk upright.
Bipods are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
To some extent, we can reduce future suffering by living more environmentally friendly lives, joining environmental movements, and even becoming activists.
In many cases, it's the same as symptomatic treatment, but unless we're just trying to find a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and get rid of it.
Clearly, the world has been greatly changed by human scientific and technological progress and has been aggravated by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After passing Congress on July 4, a handwritten bill signed by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
Overnight, something between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now called Dunlap prints.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The oldest known surviving copies of the document are the Dunlap broadsides, or 25 prints from Dunlap's printing house.
Many paleontologists now believe that there was one group of dinosaurs that survived to the present day, which we call birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many signs on the birds that remind us of dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are expressed as binary digits  or in computer jargon bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as vomiting are too common to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medicines or household products containing toxic chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term beetle is used by entomologists for this group of insects in a formal sense.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize on humans.
Both the convoluted and the bugs are cunning, adapted to living in the nest or living in their host.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or that of their child.
These couples can decide on a plan to adopt their child.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the child's parents can become another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the guideline for most scientific research.
An experiment is a test used to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, but scientific research also involves asking questions and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Bible, written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many recorded rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues in a free-flowing cycle even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey Chase experiment was one of the main proofs that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they either labeled the DNA in the phase with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phase with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether germline cells were affected.
Only mutations in the germline can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to admire the landscape, including wildlife and animals.
Examples of activities in this type of tourism: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem concerned.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars, go to work, and are passed by others who are going to work where they just left.
This dynamic shuttle transport involves everyone and is supported by a transport system based on private vehicles.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has derailed the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transport system.
In developed lands, you rarely encounter such complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers just incompetent? Or is there something deeper?
Traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interaction that occurs between them.
Unfortunately, monitoring traffic flow is difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave similarly within a range; therefore, traffic usually has a reasonable consistency and can be approximately mathematically represented.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, the relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating transport facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them a greater choice of small spaces to hide from predators.
Today, they are the only insect that can't fold wings, dragonflies and lizards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That sounds reasonable, because you don't think the Earth moves, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, and it drains more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in places.
All of the 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of our planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main stream is 6,387 kilometers long, collecting water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed either in size or in technical precision.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of the Vatican is about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Since the elements are found in nature in their pure form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools, people have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, which were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four groups of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also theorized that they change into new substances that form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are a lot of elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are among the metals, but of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that the period at the end of this sentence would fit trillions of them.
That is why the pencil has become a good friend to many people since its invention.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower position and secondary use.
People today are texting on computer screens, so they don't get in touch with the clipper at all.
You can't help but wonder what happens to the keyboard when something new comes along.
A fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
It's like driving a heavy cart up a hill, and then the nuclear core splits and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay on slight or even no contact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the upside and about 100 kilometers on the downside.
It's weaker under the sea and stronger under the mountains.
On the near side, there may be more lunar seas because the crust is thinner here, which could have made it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Content theories are about finding out what people can relate to or are close to.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they take for granted during adolescence.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want what they do and what in their environment causes them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid theory of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behaviour can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues  peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility and leading people to accountability.
At the other end of the spectrum, you're transformed beyond recognition, and you feel like you have to change everything that the team does, and do it your way.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This often results in disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their own physical group.
They often have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of the virtual team is also the presence of the so-called 'invisible team' (Larson  LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is the management team to which each member is subordinate.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of building a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity can be shown if all available resources are used efficiently across the functional components of the organisation.
As a result, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes to serve customer needs.
To be innovative, an organisation's management must create an innovative corporate culture, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that organisations use to achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide a physical record of the theoretical approach to cognition, narrowing and refining this research area.
Scientists in their research support the link between brain disease and behavior.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations in science fiction, it is a very important area of computer science dealing with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research involves building machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and inquiries, handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military and is built into a number of home computer applications and video game software.
Excursions are an essential part of every class, and a teacher often likes to take her students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual field trips, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual sharing excursions are also a great way to think about the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and every year the site is revised, but the old versions stay online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing, and while their blogging is often marked by sloppy spelling in the beginning, the influence of other readers usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical readers, the blogger tries to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to have an overview of the world around them.
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs  will allow students to improve their analytical and critical abilities; by actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their positions in the context of other texts and formulate their point of view on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, with a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north, the beauty of the Muskoka region and beyond is still waiting to be discovered.
All of this and more highlights Ontario's foreign-looking character as a typical part of Canada.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Many people are surprised to learn that there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, in terms of wildlife, can be considered a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are annexed by France and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The area is bounded on the north by the Sahel, on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: It is recommended that all travelers present themselves as married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It is also good to wear a ring (just be careful not to make it look too expensive).
Women should bear in mind that cultural differences may sometimes lead to harassment and that it is not uncommon for a man to watch a woman walk, hold her hand, and so forth.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't excuse it!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, and after the earthquake of 1755 they abandoned it.
The Moroccan Sultan renamed the city Dar al-Badya, and Spanish traders who established trading posts there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tin cans, pottery, leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of crates, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside the city should be well thought out in light of the current state of fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for hiking the Nyiragongo volcano and offers one of the cheapest mountain gorilla sightings in Africa.
You can take a boda boda (motorcycle taxi) for a short trip, which usually costs about 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of its desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during the PBS television program Wonders of the African World, which was hosted by Henry Luis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it seems more Arab than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of the South African National Park and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South Africa's national parks, there is an entrance fee and a conservation fee.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The city of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which many tourists consider to be a major travel destination.
The pattern of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a sparkling column chart reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
The best views of Hong Kong are obtained from the island and the opposite bank of the Kowloon.
The vast majority of the dense urban development on Hong Kong Island is located on land reclaimed from the sea along the northern coast.
This is a place that was appropriated by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves, stretching 80 kilometres (50 miles) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining stretches of mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans area covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by watersheds or wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 Indian tigers can currently be found in the area.
Buses leave from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since long-distance buses are often full, it is recommended that you buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhood is served by small Japanese shore buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long, and it has two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical light height under the bridge is 15 meters.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, originally called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounters between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a three-century period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held here at other times of the year.
If you're interested in tournaments and where to get tickets to polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted in remote islands, but you may be able to use British and American currency.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so make sure you exchange before you leave.
Because Montevideo lies south of the equator, summer is here when it's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in a subtropical area; temperatures are usually above 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] during the summer months.
Winters can be treacherously cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but together with wind and humidity, they seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park rules say to stay at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Although they may appear peaceful, bison, deer, elk, bear, and almost all large animals are capable of attack.
Every year, many visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so leave them their space.
Also, bear in mind that bears and other wildlife are attracted to odors, so avoid carrying or cooking spicy foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of the infamous 1889 naval stalemate when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, killing nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
During the Mau-organized independence effort, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the killing of the supreme leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is located between two harbours, and the most popular beaches are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost sandy beaches with safe swimming and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are at Waitemata Harbour in the sought-after Mission Bay and St Heliers areas of central Auckland.
They're sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide variety of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer but a pleasant and refreshing one.
There are many French wines you can try, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be a better choice.
Tap water is safe to drink, but if you are worried, bottled water is usually available.
For Australians, the idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign, "small black" is "espresso", "cappuccino" is full of cream (not foam), and "tea" is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're top-notch.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Still, listen to the advice of the authorities, follow the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The four-toed sloth is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the town of Seventeen Seventy.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The sea crocodile is not active in the ocean, its primary refuge being the estuary north of the city of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodations in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to stay at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but other forms of accommodation such as camping can be booked through them.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport to/from the airport or even combined airline and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to think or to obtain additional documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
Any modifications or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel address.
In the case of some festivals, a substantial majority of visitors choose to camp on site and most participants consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be in the middle of the action, you'll need to arrive as early as possible to secure a campsite that's located near the music production.
Remember that while the music on the main stage may have ended, in other sections of the festival, the music may continue late into the night.
Some festivals include special camps for families with young children.
If you are travelling across the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as sailing through the ice causes unbearable noise in exposed areas.
Circular Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city.
Casinos usually try to keep guests in as much time and money as possible, usually with no windows and no clocks, often difficult to find the way out.
They usually have special food, drinks and entertainment to keep visitors in a good mood and on the casino premises.
Some establishments offer alcoholic beverages on the house's tables, but drunkenness adversely affects judgment, so all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitude or in a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you cannot drive as you would on unpaved asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow falls in a very short time to make it impossible for you to drive.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or flying snow or by snow or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, in many countries, ice and snow are normal and traffic continues without major interruptions throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa, and for many tourists, it is the highlight of the trip.
Safari, in the familiar sense, is a land trip to see the stunning wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles, and standard equipment will give them a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better observe them with a telescope.
A tourist safari consists of a hiking trip lasting from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held at various venues in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted in 1964.
If you booked your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay was announced, this may be a difficult situation for you.
Cancellation policies may vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not apply to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 Japanese yen, with regular tickets costing 7,000 Japanese yen.
Ironing wet clothes can help dry them, and many hotels have ironing machines and ironing boards available for rent, even when not in the room.
If an iron is not available or you do not like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause clumping or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes a minute to boil water, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're concerned, you should buy sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests of animals unknown in their home regions.
A noxious insect can cause food spoilage, skin irritation, or worse, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can forcefully injure or kill humans are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and other charges in the areas concerned.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save significant amounts, especially when buying products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, often traversing isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep corners, narrow lanes, and sharp turns are common.
The maximum speed permitted is significantly lower than on the preceding and following sections  usually 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and its strict observance is even more important.
Interestingly, though, mobile phone service here is far better than in many sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German doughnuts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are rich and varied, much like their southern neighbors in Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples used year-round, followed by cherries and plums in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds and hazelnuts and other nuts.
If you want to taste some tasty sweets, try the pastries, which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made from various herbs, spices and meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either dry or wet depending on how much liquid it contains.
In the Mediterranean regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly added to curry, while coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that covers a wide range of regional cuisines from across the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to cuisine originating in the central and eastern parts of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, includes many simple-tasting dishes that are flavored with peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The beams, which hang from both sides of the saddle, serve as a support for the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but may be associated with safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet becoming stuck in them.
If the rider is thrown off the horse but his leg gets caught in the stirrup and the horse starts running, the rider can pull behind him.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft sole that is relatively narrow.
In addition, some saddles, especially English, have safety skis that allow the harness to fall off when a rider pulls on it.
Chochamo Valley  Chilean Prime Minister's favourite mountaineering destination known as the Yosemite of South America, where extensive granite walls and cliffs can be found.
The peaks of the mountains offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes thanks to the endless potential of the walls.
Winter downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
"Skiing is a common travel activity with many fans sometimes known as "ski vagabonds", who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location".
The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
The first recreational ski club was opened in Norra, Australia in 1861.
Ski tourism: This activity is also referred to as ski tourism, ski tourism or ski trips.
It is related to alpine skiing or mountaineering, although they are not part of this activity, the latter of which is done in rough terrain and requires much stronger skis and boots.
Think of a ski trail as a tourist trail.
Under favorable conditions, you can cover a little more distance than on foot, but you will rarely move at the speed you would on a treadmill without a heavy backpack and a modified track.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with a number of independent countries, and normally traveling through several countries would mean going through several visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions similarly to a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.
This definition has geographical variations, where, for example, the age limit may be lower in North America than in Europe.
Handmade items can be classified as antiques even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many other professions.
Not all Sami people traditionally raised large reindeer, but they also fished, hunted, and other activities.
Today, many Sami people work in modern crafts, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region.
Although the term gypsy is used extensively, especially among the non-Roma population, it is often considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are about to visit becomes the subject of a travel recommendation, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
You may prefer to look at the advice of governments other than your own, but it is primarily for their own citizens.
For example, U.S. citizens may face different situations in the Middle East than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in the country.
The views presented are often confused, general and oversimplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Adverse weather is a general term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Stormy weather can occur anywhere in the world, and it can take different forms depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rainfall and fires are forms and effects of stormy weather, such as storms, tornadoes, cloud gaps and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include hailstorms, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to have an overview of all possible risks of adverse weather in their area as this may affect all travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.

The backstreams are the returning waves that hit the beach, often at the point of a cliff, etc.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in several deeper sections, and this is where a fast current can form into deep water.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from trying to swim back upstream, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the flow, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be swept away by the current again, or, depending on your ability and whether you've been spotted, wait for help.
The shock of return comes before the culture shock (there is a smaller initial excitement phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.

Freight forwarders are well paid for quick delivery of goods.Time is often a very important factor for business documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but on other routes and smaller companies, a problem has arisen.
If the goods were sent by air freight, then on some routes it could take several days for the goods to pass through unloading and customs control.
The only way to do this faster is to send it as checked baggage, but airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
