Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers this as a myth, claiming that election fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments passed new laws starting in 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained scale after the November 2010 elections, which added 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states were introduced during the year 2011.
New electoral laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the periods of early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election, and deprive citizens with a judicial record of their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana Act.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people in the age of voting, do not possess photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not possess the required photo ID card.
much more .
Students, from voters considered to be voting more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a request.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Spanish voting.
Two out of three Spanish voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states.
Furthermore, they restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped register about 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of state voters.
It was the same with the Spanish.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by Democratic governors’ vetoes.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to reduce the damage in part.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID card.
However, the new rules will undoubtedly make it harder to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal of influencing the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that passed these laws represented 171 of the 270 votes needed for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes even more hesitant men already reluctant to pass screening tests.
To pass the test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, that one has between 30 and 40% more chances of having metastases if one is not diagnosed.
I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if you have a direct parent who has had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
You really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of their cancer, by offering them the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not harm long-term life, and instead choosing, in those cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to be actively monitored and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more criteria are being defined to determine who should or should not be treated.
So I recommend passing the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine if you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool for evaluating the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from them.
It is estimated that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
It is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many of them remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very harmful to people’s health.
“Today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
“Research shows that regular physical activity throughout a lifetime protects against colon cancer,” he added.
The Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
There are also scams, and they should be avoided.
Conserving meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” it says.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also not clearly established.
Moreover, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Putting a screening test does not indicate cancer."
The Higgs Boson Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused a lot of emotion, last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the universe, nothing but that.
And then, it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model – our best, or “less worse” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is really Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely sure.
Let’s assume, however, that this is Higgs, since the chances of mistaking seem small, and let’s see what it is.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inevitable law that says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule – and don’t try too hard, you’ll hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting largely of some of their characteristics.
Therefore, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything – at least not for that principle, which means that they can be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary, by the way) site The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "force particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, it should be pointed out here, are not all so exotic beasts as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "light particle" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in that specific place, a bit like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this “disturbance” a electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon – and therefore, one of the “force-bearing” bosons.
A more stable area
The same goes for the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it must reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond of which only a very large rock could scratch the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN – the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km perimeter! – to such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold onto a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (such as the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what “can” all this research bring, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scan any discrepancy between MS observations and predictions.
They are also many to wish that one finds it, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and clog some holes in the Model.
This, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the universe's matter (re-oops!).
However, such differences have not been found at CERN so far.
Implications
The repercussions of these researches on the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-Le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no one.
Keep in mind: at the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers at the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work was about to trigger.
They were interviewing scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsated) in 1962 - has already told us - initially the laser was seen rather as a "lab gadget".
Imagine it...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it wasn’t at all its original intention, now serves as an “eye” to all digital cameras in the world, and won the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care – The Best Way to Die
With its Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec has recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
However, there is still much to be done in this crucial area.
He tried to look at it more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that ravaged him had left him a two-year break.
"They had given me five years to live, I turned seven," he said, half-figue half-raisin, lying in his bed at the palliative care home Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, you can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Attacked before an appetizing lunch, he agrees to allow himself to help eat, resigned.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who are busy around him, brings him his medicines, offers him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this illness.
“Over the course of our lives, we learn that a man is staying,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois House.
Returning to the childhood stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called “curative” care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die “conscious and suffocated.”
But the illness made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
“I don’t have any more wishes in life,” she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the coming days, she is expected to visit her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, together with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance are provided.
Palliative care is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It’s hard to know that we will all die someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the house.
Whether on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The deceased will be accepted to provide oral care with brandy or Pepsi, as requested.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the deceased’s feet.
“We help relatives as much as patients,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days follow one another but are not similar.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who tastes his last family gathering in the courtyard, quiet in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to ease suffering when a sick person has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or at a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de soins palliatifs à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this large shortage in Quebec health care that makes several doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law framing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has circulated to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality palliative care before one agrees to proceed with euthanasia.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing anything to relieve her.
I fear that patients are asking to die only because they are not receiving adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists struggle with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard’s hopes of survival were already minimal when she abandoned a challenging chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
She told me I was finished.
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for failing to access their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in treating pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear this part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This reporting was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Health Research Institutes of Canada.
Property scandals in Quebec
Road officials, BTP contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable “system” blending building industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia.
A “industry” that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It is curious how the system has collapsed since we have taken the great means," says Jacques Duchesneau, a MP in Quebec and a former police chief of Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into malversations related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and public official corruption.
“Since the start of the inquiry in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone has saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said, “some reducing their instincts to reach a quota!”
The Charbonneau Commission “has already dropped two mayors,” he added, hoping that it will be able to “demonstrate the strategies behind individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Moreover, the policemen of the “Marteau squad” who, since 2009, had led the “water cartel” of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted a series of searches and raised charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeated bribery in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally charged with engineers at the Montreal roadway and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the “system” of obtaining public procurement.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who gave the money to Union Montreal, the party of mayor Gérald Tremblay.
In the 2000s, Zambito gave more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, mostly to the then ruling liberals.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts for which the costs were exhausted
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption was working roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former engineer in public works, detailed this before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and scams totalling $736,000, in exchange for drainage contracts of which he inflated the costs.
Other road officials have admitted that they were fattened by inflating their bills by 30% to 40% with fake extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his cash with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first electors to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she revolted in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought for $5 million and sold ... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of money spent on election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be set up, she says that it "shoots on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning the wound but it would take a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a day before, so as not to see the dubious practices return.
How the household is done.
and regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but is especially concerned about the role of “elected people aware of the scheme,” when they were not drowning in the bust!
Estimating to 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that this was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100 but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete revision of the system of public procurement and party financing: “We cannot go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on stronger foundations, with more controls and laws.”
If this story damages the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard.
PSG is not FC Barcelona.
This season, you have taken a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I progress alongside them.
The technical staff also helped me a lot.
Every day, these things push me to raise my level of play.
In the game, it is easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I am not burning.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation center to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed by steps.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are accustomed to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to face and provide the most.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by assistants like Claude Makelele, who was in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
of course .
Ancelotti inspires respect in all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has great experience and won a lot of titles with huppy clubs.
He played with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had a reassuring conversation with him in January.
I was getting out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think of the first half of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took the lead.
We are still in embuscade.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the club’s goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our word to say against very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, ahead of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th of the final return.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget.
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and sign up in duration.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means for this project to come true.
Not winning the title in League 1, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a huge disappointment.
This year, we are really looking forward to winning the title.
Last season, we didn’t go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
With 79 points, we are supposed to be champions.
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media is expecting too much from the PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
It is fully accepted.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame us for, it’s sure it’s a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people want more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
It is not FC Barcelona.
We are working on a game project.
A team is built with time.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we could be present.
Look at Manchester City, which has not been able to qualify for the eighth finals for two seasons, they have also made huge spending!
Considering the amount invested, we imagined you with 15 points in advance at the truce!
It was to ignore our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we finally won it.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the achievements of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It is better to say that there is a “Zlatan dependency.”
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and he sets a lot of goals.
He came here for that and he proves he is the League 1 star.
Everywhere he went, he showed that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the team, the man and the player are respected.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
As a disappointment.
I would like to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
I can play good games in the selection.
That’s what I’ve been hoping for since my baptism with the Blue.
We learned from what happened in Ukraine and today we must be exemplary.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first years at the head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires winning.
Just like Laurent Blanc.
I do not want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues in Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) scrapped on 16 October in Spain a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
All the opposite of current currency exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often happens in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this type of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and handles trade.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are both account book depositaries, checks, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the way of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, spread across the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction into this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and the winner of which, sort of a provisional central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a phase of file hashing, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers “take” the new transaction and add a number to it before “hacking” the set.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to cheat, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
Therefore, the number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving a margin to be used.
The difficulty of the challenge is also highlighted with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and deposited bitcoins stolen.
“The vulnerability used does not affect the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also notes the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has this disadvantage as well.
Major actors such as Wikipedia reject donations of this nature.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, support them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, “giant salaries” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes heavily in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come back cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who assures he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement of challenging hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to re-evaluate the various risks, now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
And after then?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is primarily the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often of peasants who refuse foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even though they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, they will no longer be, when the West becomes more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles entered Kabul without being attacked by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the land of fire and blood due to struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved these days.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban are uniting in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it for land to build to refugees coming from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They disregarded themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American breadths: the capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They met with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are mobile phone lovers; television, and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstructing provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
The country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s.
No industry has been restarted, no dam is in good condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was widespread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were there only to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain the province’s most important employers.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are largely dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French combat troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, department of French at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and realize the impossible task of coinciding aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has led, and carried out by a small French NGO, numerous collective interest works and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, feeding on local labor, were able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys often located at over 2,000 meters.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me to wish for, it would be necessary to maintain in their favor a small civilian aid, well controlled and that affects them directly.
A forceps constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker blow by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he has decided to play his vaut.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the assembly two more months to finish its work.
In the past two years, Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal fraud.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic deliberation”, continuing to “betray his word” and “strike the right.”
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favour, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, this recourse to a rushed vote is the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I retain full powers," these should supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this constituent assembly, with a vast majority of Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
The majority of liberals failed to appeal.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had knocked the door, believing they could not make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, substitutes, were added to the rush yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Some commentators were also amused by the fact that one of the only divergences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee believing that the pendulum of the constituent was poorly arranged.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all attention, Article 2 ultimately remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that “the principles of Sharia are the primary source of law.”
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and their respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” answer the liberals, who see it only as a communication blow.
Because, according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
According to article 220, Al-Azhar University has a consultative role, in checking compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because “the people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the origins of a theocracy there."
Liberal fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used borrow from religious vocabulary.
There is a reference to “fiqh” in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may arise in the future is to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on it.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is heavily criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Neither will the trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as human rights groups have called for.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy isined and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, of the press.
Moreover, no articles are echoing the protection of women anymore, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This was not mentioned in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak last night on television, protests are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Center of the World and a sea of salt await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has listed five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
The most important place to visit is the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptisms” will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus’ miracles: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where fishing was miraculous.
This is the place where Jesus appeared to His disciples after His resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk there on the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: the Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress of Antonia (the praetorium), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Unction and the burial.
This is where the Christian center of the world, the symbol of the salvation of humanity, is located.
According to the Christian legend, the Cross Monastery is erected in the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentation, which constitutes the remnant of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in Height
Visit the ruins of Massada Fortress, an ancient refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are found on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only alpine lovers can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, there is the ski resort of Mont Hermont which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski trails are a total of 45 km long.
Ancient beliefs suggest that pagan gods once lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
The country has about 300 museums.
It is not possible to visit them all in one visit.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also see: Tel Aviv Art Museum.
It exhibits mainly the paintings of the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of moldings from visitors and guards of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which goes back on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
The stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major resorts of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in the winter, as the water temperature does not fall below 21 degrees while the air temperature can reach 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue-colored water contains saliva and very easily holds back swimmers, even those who do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
We come there to perform a treatment based on saltwater, lemon, curative mud and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is traversed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow streets that carry the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile to you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who come to take photos from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to euros, as they are easily exchanged for shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, these are mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The trip in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cessate.
The working week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, unskalled fish and dishes made up of both milk and meat.
There are a multitude of meals from lamb and beef, soups and desserts from coconut milk, but also humus, traditional Jewish paste, various sauces, peach balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no wandering dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats that walk in the high air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These puppies love passing places and do not refuse to be given them.
The rental price of a car varies from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
These were mostly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, to Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists debate what the mandatory language test law will give, fraudsters selling “fake” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass a Russian language exam.
For now, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the legal foundations will be validated.
You will need to validate your knowledge of the Russian language to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained education certificates or diplomas before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities in the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened across the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by MEPs from the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it bring?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First, respond representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from "slavery at work".
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for immigrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in a crowded house where he and dozens of his peers will torment for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our immigrants.
"At home, they are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken, and they do not get the planned salary," said Tolib Charipov, Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Do not argue with me, sir.
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to come to make money in Russia are confident that they not only know the language of the country they want to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
This is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbek, and Tajik can afford to attend even a suitable primary education.
In fact, their families don’t even have anything to feed their children, not to mention dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people go out to earn money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language.
“You feel diminished and diminished.”
Human rights defenders note, however, an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will only be for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no subsequent examination or official work.
Nevertheless, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
“Welcome or Defense to Enter”
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then you can get a fake registration quickly for only 1500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we have no records, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," said Oumed Khouchkadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan.
Hurry up, don’t be upset and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.
From the first day of the language law’s entry into force, it was discovered that migrants’ registration papers were not the only ones to be fake.
Several false language exam certificates have already been confiscated by federal immigration officials.
The counterfeit paper comes out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
It is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “papers.”
Authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first test time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not deal with the arms market.
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low.
The Russian Interior Ministry has proposed tougher laws against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it is the shootings carried out during weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullet guns in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a gun permit from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the weapons law would be introduced to the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "pushing the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and the Headquarters.
Screenshot of a site taking weapons orders
The first is "military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explained that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement representatives.
Illegal guns are sold from military warehouses.
Many of them often suffered explosions.
"Attested versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to hide the deficit," the former military said.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
"We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition in the international market and sell weapons on the black market, in Moscow," one expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant proportion of guns and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes handicraft, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons present on the black market were found there "because of the employees whose work is related to weapons," the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% come from “clandestine sheets”.
A salesman and consultant at an armor store who asked to remain anonymous assured that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these clandestine excavators; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will look for new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases through a sign a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
It is delivered by passing the goods through a grillage.
“He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 per unit with two chargers,” he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the affairs, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers," the seller added.
Like in a luxury store.
The seller and buyer usually find themselves through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered me to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me into a "point" to shop.
The price of the gun was given to me.
Victor Baranets as military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you also have to come by saying, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He gives them to me only because he knows that I will not give them to him.
New kids are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Victor Baranets tried himself as an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which was "everything you want."
“I thought I was in a luxury shop,” the military remembers.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, you can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, we go with the seller into the forest and install a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced the weapon works well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from the couch
Search engines show sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
You do not need any documents or anyone to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise sum of money," it is written in the advertisement on the site "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their requests and ask questions.
Will it be sold to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (reserved spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread an enormous network of fake sites and is hoarding people willing to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and former military officer
I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
“In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the right to a weapon association.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without guns and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread an enormous network of fake sites and is hoarding people willing to buy combat weapons.
"People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a Gun", one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
We will have to wait about a month and a half.
It came out of long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia overall decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the cases of proven theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
U.S. fast food and supermarket workers on strike
Nearly a quarter of U.S. teenagers work at McDonald’s
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages practiced by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or disappear quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist associations.
Along with the modest salary increases received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
40 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a raining rain of salaries seized millions of people hit America and sometimes triggered flashes.
That day, some employees of the Walmart company, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize strikes with unions and leftist activists in the company’s stores whose products are aimed at consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart sells everything from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid employees at Walmart only shop at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply due to the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting trucks or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" demonstrations demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic worker at Walmart who earns $9.5 an hour, it’s a sum he can’t afford.
Scientists at the University of California Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the wage increases to consumers’ shoulders, each run in the store would return them 46 cents more.
They will spend just $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and brought no harm to the group.
The Black Friday continued in the stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second over that period.
In total, 100 million transactions were made on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogleman, assured in an interview with the leftist Huffington Post website that in all “less than five” Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a “operation of com” among many others” on the part of the organizing union.
“The next client!”
The protests continued this week in New York and also did not concern Walmart stores (in this progressive city they are not very appreciated, which is why they are not yet established there) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and after they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work you’ve honestly done!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage stipulated by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but little, on average, its core employees earn in New York $8.90 an hour.
No one is worse than you in this city.
It is unthinkable for me to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their primary source of income there or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live with that salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum you find comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them with.
Demonstrators who launched the movement Thursday at 6:30am near the McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that cashers and fast food chefs be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing this and punishing union protesters by bribe or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, mastering fast food remains a difficult task, and that for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They disagree
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the midday rally near the Times Square McDonald’s with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including that of City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: “McDonald’s announces selling billions of servings and afterwards they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you the work you’ve done honestly!”
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in sight, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said that “we all need to support fast-food workers so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the biggest fast food industry event in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that they were not all fast food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small.
“For now, one can only mediumly deceive the brain.”
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google who unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had filed for the patent.
However, it turns out from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
Can you tell us in a few words what your research team is doing?
We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment on flat screen pixels and sometimes on the touchscreen.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in gesture control.
What does the future reserve to us?
Although Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, is not really.
We’re trying to change that and we’re working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to bring the computer world into our own, into the physical world, to make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more convenient form.
Let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not widespread gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet worn in the hand that recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
That is to say?
For example, how would you ask me to pass this can to you?
You would do it with words and gestures.
Usually I just talk.
It will be hard to recognize.
So, do you want to force users to adjust based on what the machine can or can’t do at a given time?
Not necessarily, but it is a relationship.
I think very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
This can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good depth resolution and this is very important.
If you are interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you dislike about modern cameras?
Are they lacking in resolution, depth or something else?
In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels at a speed of 1000 cps.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to the latter, all current technologies are pretty good, which adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution according to the axes X and Y, but also Z, must be kept in mind.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory has given the touch of sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, with current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would really need a device of this type in my work, but not need to touch, to have more frames in the second.
Shouldn’t the number of cameras be increased?
The Kinect now has three “cams”, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It does not define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a Kinect-like flexible product, play with the camera curve and see how this could help define locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a hand-raised smartphone is not practical but here’s what I think: the best option would be a “temporary” augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch from glasses to smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes them strong (the personal items are the ones you’re the only one to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is one problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no touch sensation!
My hands feel nothing.
What are your responses to this challenge?
In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For now, one of the interesting techniques is the use of second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly copes with the pressure.
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that affect the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
Have you tried to fool your brain?
Make him believe he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
This is a good idea, I haven’t tried it yet.
There’s still one task down there that you’ll still have to work on for a long time: how to make someone who’s physically in a very small space believe he’s walking in an almost infinite open space – we’re working on running carpets concepts (nothing to do with those we find in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For now, one can only medium-sized the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: a lot of things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors of the art scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city boundaries and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extroverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red, who can be crossed near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the parties and vernishes.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always bring together the crowd, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical St. Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of new myths.
Kirill Miller was a prominent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the locals smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of a Bohemian.
“Kirill, why are you walking around the city in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red as a fashion designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
When did you realize you wanted to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I began to make friends with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, in fashion, in music, in all genres except words.
It was important for me to be in the center of St. Petersburg’s culture, where the best creative forces must gather.
In 1995, I took my place at Pushkinskaya-10, which was the home of a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour coming up with the project "The Van Gogh ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy playback songs in moulding shirts, they included Igor Vdovin, a composer today in fashion.
When the band began performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated a lot of shows before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education he received from us.
Gallery "D137", Club "Gribojedov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year", and it was then that my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong currentity and sharpness.
I will have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, now it hurts and it scares to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything is erased, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not the inside of the person.
Maybe you can’t give him a hand, but you should spit him in the trunk.
And the lie will be wiped out by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Anyone but me can play it.
But art can also be beautiful.
Commercial art today must be careful, delicate, liquorous.
A disintegration of culture is happening.
Previously, people were divided into flocks, Bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I’m not a $100 bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you like.
Each of them has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It is people who have been thrown out who come to see it, it is the sexual and social side that works.
But on the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything is wasted.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to ruin the life.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hanged next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those that are painted at the end of life.
Ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
It has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday’s culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused the money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it was not so, the tsars did not understand culture well, but they understood that the good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are discarded, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and pave their way.
It is now the “kingdom of taste” that is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who must find themselves other museums.
What is St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this bed is very good.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.

Birth in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with terrestrials on board depart in search of a rescue planet.
In order to save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in distress or on a rescue planet?
I think there is not much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
“It’s Venus and Mars,” said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
You can only live there at very high altitudes or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to be interested in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit differed in no way from terrestrial varieties.
Subsequently, insects, small reproductive drosophile flies, were put into orbit.
In 1979, shrimp eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed in weighty conditions.
You get a completely normal chicken out.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chicken has to find a support, it has to stand on its legs and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Without any support, the chickens agitated disorderly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The birds did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We scratched their eyes twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chickens in space.
The last biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only ship species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
Nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"These were still biosatellites and then this is the only experiment. This kind of research must be carried out," notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
This is not a small affair.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, humans are capable of this.
Homo sapiens possesses the abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has the most precious.
Our shuttle flew and no one on Earth could say if it would stand after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the theft.
“Nobody answered this question,” said Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired officer in the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child’s father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been on orbit twice and even worked in an extra-vehicle environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Nevertheless, humanity has to look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center: mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, at zero floatability, cosmonauts train for extra-vehicle exits.
The water imitates the heavier.
If for adults, water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious humans seem to confirm this: life on Earth originates from the ocean.
As the baby develops for about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother’s womb, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it only takes 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget," explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newborn baby the weight is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a force of weight.
When weighing, the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the ability to push the baby is lost.
Well, let’s ignore this by relying on birth simulators.
You can, of course, prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will be able to get it out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to reflect on this complex question.
Children also need artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can’t dress a baby like an adult with a special combination for training.
They are simply deprived of their vital needs.
"And this experiment we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will result in the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthans will travel in their spacecraft to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Supreme Institution for Public Finance Control) said: “The control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech “Švarc system”) has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but is lagging behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Higher Institution for Public Finance Control, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that's what is lacking in us," Kala said in his comment on the current situation.
A joint inspection conducted by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abuse the approach of the “Švarc system” by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister recently stated that the SDG would not bother entrepreneurs with checks; is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government can not prevent an authority responsible for going to inspect from demanding compliance with the law," says Kala.
During the meeting of the Audit Committee in the House of Deputies, you talked about a Czech-German project in which the public procurement legislation of these two countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, EU legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national laws and practices follow it.
We have put together all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "stricter and better quality", however, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continuously develop increasingly detailed rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project actually help you and what does it mean for you?
A common control of this type should just help us stop trying to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those who search for its gaps will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You talk about internal issues related to the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar institution to our ISC or a different way of organizing?
As for institutions, similar to the ISC, there works the Bundesrechnungshof which is organized similarly, it also has a council constituted slightly differently, but these two institutions proceed fundamentally in a similar way.
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, but with a nuance compared to our system: as Germany is a federal structure, it therefore also has accounts of this type at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control the federal money, which in our country corresponds to the state resources.
Public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the council of the Länder.
Is national legislation easier than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designated as a model but one can not say that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it’s because they have better inspectors?
No, not, but I repeat, I do not have comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we see as a model also faces a whole host of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage of cooperating with our institution, right?
With regard to national legislation, what has the amendment of the Public Procurement Act meant for you as an institution, are its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment came into force relatively recently, it has no impact on our control operations yet.
As we do controls a posteriori, we have to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing for future checks – we have launched a new “risk detection of mismanagement” tool with which we spotted 14,000 public contracts – there these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been modified as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the subjects controlled to accept that any violation of the market law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really worth making the law stricter this way?
Not in this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let’s look where we are not going.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called Švarc system - what does this mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from acting to go inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He may declare, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing happened.
The law on contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be fulfilled, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that an bidder is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads are frozen in some places, but most are still practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Province of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, roads were practicable this morning, but in frozen and also snowed places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5° and -10°C but are expected to slightly rise over the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the area and there is only a thin layer of snow left in the plains.
The heights of the Metallifer Mountains (Krušné hory) are however covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to data from the regional road maintenance service, due to the fog, visibility was reduced in some places.
The R6 highway and the national roads of the region are now easily accessible.
However, caution remains, for example, on certain bridges whose coating may be frozen and slippery.
All department roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
There are still remains of frozen snow on some of their sections and in places crushed by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be vigilant.

The Road and Highway Administration reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that traffic-borne layers of snow can be found on roads in mountainous and altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risks of frost formation in the areas of the Pardubice region located in altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow dampened by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located in altitude.
In East Bohemia, the weather will today be dry, most often clear, with possible cloudy passages.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will typically oscillate between -3° and +1° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads of the Pilsen region are now practicable, although, in some places, it is necessary to exercise increased vigilance and adapt its driving to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the recent snowfall and the subsequent cooling, some communication routes may be frozen in some places.
Drivers can expect to cross areas of fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is stated in the information of the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to walk, however, road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between 80 and 131 kilometers.
The covering of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-Sud and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third-class roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be vigilant, especially on the less crowded roads in the Šumava region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers traveling to the high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to count on a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the neck of the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical processing operations.
Snowfall forced road maintenance personnel to go to the field this night; according to the services in charge of the road, it fell more than three centimeters in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the area, most of the roads are easily accessible.
“On the heights of the Šumperk district there are remains of snow.
Drivers driving in the direction of Jeseník should expect to encounter a thick and soft layer of snow at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" crossing," the head of road maintenance services of the Šumperk district told ČTK today.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited the site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now loose and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easily accessible, in the district of Šternberk drivers should, however, be careful in sections in forested areas with wet roads.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
Earlier this morning, North Bohemia’s road maintenance services several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and so snow and frost should remain on the roads.In the plains, especially in the southeast of the central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been so far.
Road maintenance services the presence of glaciers, in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and melting snow during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
From the main traffic axes, difficult conditions are also on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: “Together, we want to collect positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh at it rather and say that we are the only group able to collect a remainder of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you are setting up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell our readers about this project in more detail?
This is a charitable activity that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
On December 20th, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Maya calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I thought it was my idea, then we designed it all with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Aside from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other artists also recorded an anthem against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will it also be heard at these charitable concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be performed simultaneously by all three performers.
The anthems will also be joined at some point as part of a completely unique live broadcast by Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also plays the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X y sings also...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other figures in the Czech show business, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We are trying to get them to participate intensively in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that they enjoy it.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the training center Studeo which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on as part of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will a number of musicians and performers be on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that addresses all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will feature Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you preparing for more such events in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the House of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It is not so terrible as it seems at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose machinery must travel in a stack, of course we also trim a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything has gone more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
With your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very inaccessible to people with disabilities; there, it is still not common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the city center.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association striving to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What are we going to do with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for.
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of the people involved.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
However, it is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For now, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what prompted you to create this group in 1998?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by a lot of young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we have lost some control of the situation (laughs).
This has only happened in recent years, if I am not mistaken.
True, creating links with well-known singers and actively working on the promotion of the group helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to EU grants, we can, in addition, afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach that level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is of course pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, which we must take with pity.
They are people who can live a full life and thrive, provided they have the means to do so, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities something, it’s not just a breakthrough for them but for society as a whole.
Isn’t your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many areas and require some discipline.
But I think that is quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds, and when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many were there in 2008?
One of them is Lada Angelovic.
We are an open group, people come in and go out, we can’t do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want to join us.
This will be the case on the day before the planned end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
The event will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fleda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World Canceled" will be sung together.
The purpose of the concert is to raise funds (in the amount of 25 million CZK) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo located in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of this agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of ESA projects.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his cutting-edge work entitled “Introduction to Astronautics”.
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote numerous books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
As early as 1925 a drainage was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake drainage.
The only information known about this drainage is that of the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is clear from the conserved documents that this research had reached the experimental stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects aimed at the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the provisional advisory scientific committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works devoted to aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, in which there are four more detailed articles devoted to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1,800 meters was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version, RM-1A, was built, and during the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-story RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov desert.
This rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed probably 11.5 kilograms.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965 succeeded the first RM rocket.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of vehicles was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aeronautical institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland joined the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960 and a national committee was established two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The abolition of the law on public utility works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the law on public utility works.
This decision has sparked a heated debate in the public.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This specifically means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results from the principle of free trade and free (unlimited) movement of private capital coupled with unrestrained financial speculation.
Significant differences in labour price (wages) generate pressure on prices.
It is appropriate to put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives by importing goods sold low to resist economic competition by "making more expensive" the competitor's price, in order to remove a greater share of the market and thus increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, buy at low prices, or disappear.The result is significant unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it creates, the social burden of the state necessarily increases.
All this intensifies the perfect ill-will of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is at such a point of public recognition that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The ruthless practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of different countries are forced to engage in competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account social collapse.
This is mostly reflected in the amendments to existing laws.
The goal is to economically force its own population to accept the dictates of the prices of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is caused, on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by the restriction of workers’ rights in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening the differences between rich and poor.
In RFA, there have been for years public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
With the increasing competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a surcharge for them to reach the lifetime minimum.
Such a scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
Economic measures in virtually all the southern member states of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live on miserable wages, on the margins of society, hoping that one day private capital will invest in their country.
The question here is: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media argue, tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It must then be asked whether private capital does not influence, and does not even direct, today, according to its own selfish interests, politics and by the same, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
Proof of this is that there is a lobby that is practically all-powerful and present in every state.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual advantages, in the legislation, where everything is condemned but not punishable.
In the RFA, the situation is such that due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the drafting of bills to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, as declared by Western-type constitutions, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberalism-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianus in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in full delicescence and functions were attributed by violence.
Blunders, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-table and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to elections with votes already sold”... ... “Honest people did not seek to obtain functions at all, it resulted once the state remained 8 months without consuls” ... “It really began to be said that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man”... It is true that Appianos had Pompey in mind, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolutist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference for personal gain, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result is, today as in the past, an unprecedented decadence of the elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems in favor of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely ignorant of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of human lives, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abolition of the Law on Public Works is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and domestic European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is systematic.
The solution is sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel is a laboratory of chaos.
“Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will,” Sting said in the song titled Fragile, whose main verse in the refrain is “Don’t forget how fragile we are.”
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there’t be,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have risen.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing for its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurring killings; in short, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view “behind the curtain,” about one that is mostly benefiting from tensions that have been ongoing for more than 95 years (since the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small handful of countries in the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost the history of a struggle for power.
At any time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owe their acts on the throne to someone who directed their acts according to pre-defined goals.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not have taken place in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth stands out especially the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the pear (I do not know if these families still have a leader, but I do not rule it out).
There is little written about them.
of course .
As early as the nineteenth century, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a reinforcement of their power, an increase in their fortune, or both.
They hold major holdings in almost most central banks in the world and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of such countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi of only 4, while Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild’s Bank of America’s central bank status and began issuing his own (governmental, I think) money during the Civil War and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 as he wanted to file a trial against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the global level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan for three world wars by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to suppress colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population by between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the Fed intended to prevent crises like those they caused in 1907 from happening again).
After successfully triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly with a German surrender without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary to destroy Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the splitting of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of World War II, the bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany ferocious war reparations thus creating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (then they simply placed a leader energetic enough, showing the fingers of the culprits, offering simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that was to play the role (which it actually held) of the fifth column to set the powder on fire and start a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundation for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
World War II broke out; it is difficult to judge whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could provoke a Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population, as it was during World War II, will be the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people are sharply divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong engenderes another wrong in a circle of endless violence and where at the root of everything is the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we must distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers only propose their own candidates to the people in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) expand into a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz through which 20% of all world oil transits (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and generate a destruction of the world economy.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
The New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of financial aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
“Let them compel all men, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to wear a mark of red iron on their hand or their foreheads, so that they may neither buy nor sell anyone who is not named by the name of this wild beast or by the number of his name.
It must be understood: that he who has common sense count the figures of this wild beast.
This number means man, and it is six hundred and sixty-six.”
The movie Argo: When Everything Goes Worse, Call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a group of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, indeed, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a tough blow to the prestige of the United States, further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release hostages by force.
The kidnapped diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian defeat contributed heavily to the defeat of Jimmy Carter over Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, directed by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees escaped the embassy.
After complicated journeys, they found themselves in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a filming team that came to make signs for the shooting of a major science fiction film.
Combination of Genres
The plan by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores this film project, press conferences were held and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, with the film based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a part of a realistically conceived political thriller but also a “caper movie”, the story of a successful blow, a betrayal – like, for example, in the Ocean’s trilogy eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres succeed: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences iconic photographs of the time of events are presented and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed into the film, there are no big differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has started his career again.
From a ridiculous actor, he became a respected director and his play as an actor ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is her third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
This is also Affleck’s first film not to take place in his home town, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of the atmosphere in Argo where Tehran’s role “is held” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his colleagues get a similar effect in fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in Tehran's bazar).
Too much action in too many places.
The director had to be content with a subject that in fact offers only a few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It does well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track is quite pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipation, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their roles of Hollywood co-workers, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from being the only ones in this case.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is seen with moderate interest, appreciating the 1970s realisation and retro style.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the affair.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public survey on the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch the contest of the regulation or ideas from the "EU workshop" the most absurd.
"The fact that the EU has recently considered adopting a 40 percent quota of women for the management of major European companies has been at the origin of our decision," said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women were preferred in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the obligation to add biocomponents to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition to use reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has resulted in an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticisms have also been raised in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the phrase "butter to tart" or the withdrawal from the sale of traditional bulbs.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters in size.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, at the root of the fact that in the EU bananas must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it merely harmonised non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards on fruits and vegetables have been eased despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year’s EU regulation that must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 should not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a U.S. survey that shows that balloons are, among toys, the leading cause of child death from suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in trade fair trumpets.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official position within the EU can not use the name "Macedonia" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire" of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation on the volume of food stockpiles on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and therefore risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found interesting the idea of paying money to certain countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to apply for subsidies.
These ideas, however, do not come from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have the sea is a disadvantage.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund."This was stated in the autumn of 2004 by the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, due to our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Eventually, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized a tender for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The subsidies for obtaining subsidies were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were to be used in writing applications for subsidies granted by Brussels.
The EU says: “Strange regulations are rare.”
While regulations are often critical in Member States, according to many experts, the EU’s efforts in regulating and improving the effectiveness of the EU’s functioning as well as in the area of its overall development deserve rather praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but were imposed by Member States in budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, must fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) arouses vivid emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane alcohol, and not from beet sugar, may be referred to as rum.
The official list of registered products in the EU now includes world-renowned cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck and Parma jambon, Karlovy Vary (Karlovarské suchary), Pohořelice and Třeboň (Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr) and Žatec (Žatecký chmel).
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Cornets de Hořice" ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I’m just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
How do you feel about running for the presidential election?
It is not to be a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how the country has been looted for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under locks and taxes and the retirement age is rising.
I had no ambition of becoming a politician.
But when I see something that I don’t like, then I try to bring a solution so that it changes.
And since I am over forty years old and I am an independent member of no party, I have no other options to influence the situation than to run for the presidential or senate elections.
You entered the Senate but quickly set out on your way to the Château (N.d.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have elected you?
I have always said that I will fight for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Later, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for the presidential election.
My purpose is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we rally at the bar or in front of our TV station, but it is also that we cough those who try to bring change.
Add to this the press that breaks people’s reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I swaddle journalists or that I was the adviser of Jiří Paroubek.
Now to your visions.
You started the struggle for the Castle with the themes of material and criminal liability of politicians and retroactive tax returns of more than twenty million [of CZK].
You have to change the law for that purpose.
As president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I pressured for tour guide activities to be a liberal profession, I gained cause.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is deliberately rejected and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and put it into practice.
Do you consider yourself a leftist or a right-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me on the left.
Whether it’s left or right, it doesn’t really matter.
The important thing for me is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get angry when someone says you’re a populist?
Does what you say not prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and vision.
You are trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been applied by the world and recognised experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of Parliament, you only have slogans.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to bring them together in my camp to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
Per they should explain why they don’t want it.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, it was achieved through the pressure of public opinion.
I admit, without ambiguity, that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I’m just getting into politics and I’m trying to get the support of the majority for my program.
I’m trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It was as if Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person can’t make a difference, so I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to also run for the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I presented myself because people are really dissatisfied but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote and who did, mostly, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independent members.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the election by direct suffrage of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to set up your own party?
No, not yet, because I don’t have time to check if the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don’t have the financial means to do so.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Do you have no money?
You are talking about tax returns, what is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal assets at around 60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a child’s dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving a car, was galantine with women, and was fighting evil and abuse.
You’re driving Aston Martin, you have a fortune worth 60 million and you don’t have money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the country but don’t want to invest your own money in it?
This is not very convincing.
I don’t have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I have already invested 2 and a half million in the country.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that my program doesn’t arouse much interest.
I don’t have to pay this money out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the salary I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t survive, for example, paying my son’s English school which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I would not run for any election.
Do you want to continue your business so that you can live?
Didn’t you say that you’d be putting your business on the lookout?
This is not related to the amount of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live from something.
What was your normal monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I still win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV office prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, just look at Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I find this building funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passing woman on the street's bottom.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist at a big neighboring company, tells us, “Yes, this building is really beautiful.”
I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has an Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one is willing to go to one of these lingering libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a very special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls displays the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give some neurons back to the brains, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of beautiful little miniatures of painted armed concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam architectural office MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of mindful and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual sputum and presented himself to the contest in 2003 with five pounds under his arm and a scratch on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still staring at each other, confused and lifting up their shoulders, Maas, the overwhelmed, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his activist-backed speech with one: "Dear Common!"
Here is my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and townhouses for a total of 50 homes.
In early November, the Book Mountain received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus this dull little town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall of an awful ugliness, whose white façades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under the cheese bell.
Sure, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massive, but the real joys of reading and architecture open up to you as you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The entirely glass interior is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant reverberals speak unambiguously the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking at public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing with the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library rays are located along the façade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We completely overturned the classic spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skillfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the building's technical center.
A special beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes staircase ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened building architects and engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to Standard.
This is how one day we found in a frison farm an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, a millimetre thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown away.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a stunning view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute toining the ideal level of moisture of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books lies beneath a glass bell, the sun only shines the interior for a short time, even on days of good weather.
The thick wooden bars mounted across the glass facade serve as a sunshine, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
Completely automated stores take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse’s “soul finally found.”
A few weeks ago, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure helped to fill the gaps in the library that was not yet fully enclosed (now it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays flood from everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, “There is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
It’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline called, in professional jargon, “creation of an identity.”
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
She may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: “The Germans need to play a bigger role.”
Germany voted to abstain from voting on the admission of a Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
He then chose to abstain.
Why is ?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not endorse what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as itins special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 insurgency in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Eventually, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so-called defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans fought on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still struggling to find this role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
Foreign policy, such as in France or Britain
So what does the term “normal” foreign policy really mean for the Germans?
It demonstrates the willingness to take positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national matters.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, thus by its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to some extent, different from those of other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence Germany’s stance on the conflict in the Middle East and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first has important outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to strike the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, as it is not a purely unilateral relationship.
But this is, in any case, a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany hurt its relations with the United States by choosing to abstain in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans understand the German position perfectly.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative vary.
The United States, on the other hand, vetoed with a clear voice.
Are there differences between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe the Obama Administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But given the country’s political configuration, the government of course cannot defend its position publicly.
I think the real differences in opinions are not as big as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its major European partners, on the other?
I don’t think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today, this is not the case.
They therefore cannot fit within a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are doing now on the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take on the role of a locomotive in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I think the Germans are well aware that they must play a role that marks more of their independence.
Is Germany playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany just want to play a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is always uncomfortable for her and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a larger role.
If one looks at, for example, the euro crisis, one notices that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are being heard.
This does not make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it’s always the same problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with very different neighbors and opinions, and that’s not easy.
Today, the U.S. influence on European politics is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill that void, so who is left?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don’t like it, even if it’s unpleasant to them and they’re just less appreciated, it’s life!
Stephen Szabo is the Deputy Director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, DC, an institute where scholars and policy experts from Europe and North America work together to analyze the challenges of the transatlantic community.
Szabo is also a member of the German Marshall Fund, where he has specialized in German politics, American foreign policy and transatlantic relations.
"Trade Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands worldwide.
Armani Polo, what is it?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The trademark thus enjoys such protection that the company that bears its name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, it is not certain that she would get gain of cause.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s firm specializing in property rights violations in the Far East.
Every week, a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to register their brands.
So instead of Gucci, we record Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, we record Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the sportswear manufacturer.
Pattloch opens a workbook containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and infringing intellectual property.
In major cities, there are multi-storey shopping centers that almost only sell counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: his clients charge him to tackle the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from “Bang Dakuan”.
This is the term used to refer to women who marry rich men.
Chinese officials say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we need to fight this trend,” Pattloch said.
“The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous.”
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of €15 billion, the world’s third-largest luxury product market and the fastest growing one.
However, it is not easy to erase dubious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are costly.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long time, the denomination criticized had become a “market reality”.
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have damaged his brand in China.
Sometimes the law of the jungle prevails.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the acquirer of Volvo, used a blue-and-white logo that resembled that of BMW.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against plagiars from Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the famous crocodile’s gaze in the opposite direction.
Chinese officials say they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing, however, admits that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have moved last year from an “emergency situation in the course of work to a normalized situation.”
Thus, the number of unresolved opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures remain in the office.
Acting is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and it means that for the tenth consecutive time China is at the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office would have accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
Certainly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacturing of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to retain his Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because family names can’t be protected in Germany,” said Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Marks Office rejected the Munichers’ objection.
Freudenberg won the cause in the following two instances, but the opposing party continues to fight to this day.
Vigilance is in place
The case is now in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: “The procedure is long, challenging and costs us a lot of time and money.”
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs.The archival service has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg had even in vain offered the opposing party a "great six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“That’s what we see what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers from the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region would ensure the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather manufacturing company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but could still prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “The vigilance is put.”
Pattloch and he advise German companies to be very cautious in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should instead "register in China as well everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the final act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opponent for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: tapping, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans look forward to their arrival.
Here’s the story of a link that stretches far beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, one hits the foot: cowboy boots, baskets, scarpins for ladies and mocassins for men look for rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot.
One, two, three and four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly amplify – alto, bass, tenor and soprano – they overtake, enchant and follow.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra director, almost loses his cloth shoes when he leads the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
We are Monday evening, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came, from geneticist to human medicine to man to household.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy track, each choreographer has different words, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
Being helped to help yourself
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
More than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
Seventy of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily warm meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means “songwriter” or “songwriter”.
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this area, but everyone can sing it.
For 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return to its native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers by bird flight from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of those affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest straw or land huts and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the diseases that overwhelm Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population virtually never accepts male circumcision, a measure that yet guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carried by the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of thirties.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village.The Imbongis especially saw many children on the street to whom it lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was just a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But only a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since dealt almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorragia (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The lice of the pubis and the gall belong to the parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are mainly affected?
Syphilis and blennorragia often appear in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual intercourse between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungal), blennorragia, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The spread rate of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections is observed than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one-tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genital organs, urine pain, white losses, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they regularly cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or by close body contact.
Therefore, experts recommend that anyone who frequently changes sexual partners regularly undergo examinations.
Most rapidly detected ISTs can be cured and late sequences can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but especially the funds collected by choralists through their voices across Germany, the means are accumulating.
"In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of their grandmothers.
The Gogos, as they are called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, just like the two chefs who prepare meals for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chickens.With the contribution of the American health organization PSI, the association organized a HIV screening test for many residents.
This is not obvious, because even though the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches sexuality.”
This is quite curious, coming from a country where the king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV seen in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
There are condoms in every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, “but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote cultural exchange, Imbongi choralists travel together every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many black peak inhabitants still know from apartheid times.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only gives rise to good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a few fearful border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where chorists visit their children.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the valley of the Ezulweni.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers in bird flight, back to Heidelberg, in front of these choralists who are tapping their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
NASA reveals presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft has revealed evidence of ice on Mercury.
The ice layer could be up to 20 meters thick.
NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published on Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft has evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet that is constantly immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can go up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or asteroids that might have struck Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, said Messenger chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essential elements of life arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstitials through which one observes the infinite.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, along with the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This detail from an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink spots, the hardest to identify, are the "newborns" in the universe's birth room.
The Spitzer Telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, dubbed "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has captured the flashing glow of a dying star.
The beinet-shaped circle consists of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifid nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic laboratory.
The Pleiades, star clusters also called the "seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colors.
In this infrared image, the Helix nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Water.
His similarity to a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo allows to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer Telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a moon of Saturn that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope is that of the Galaxy of the Twin.
Depending on the shade, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trails separate the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the premises of a cosmic carambolage in the Serpentary constellation: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies rush to each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Céphée.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to hundred times smaller than common domestic dust.
This photo was made from optical and X-ray images taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosetta nebula, also constantly create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright-rayed galaxy, pervaded by a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was made up largely of hydrogen.
Our look at the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not ceased to grow bigger and thanks to them it has been possible to see ever further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors with each a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is enormous.The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter is approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its high capacity to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the radio telescope of Arecibo (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by contributing the computing power of their machine.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror should reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered to be the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory which observes the sky with the Subaru Telescope and IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration makes it possible to admire him.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mostly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched in early 2018 on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the big bang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the north pole of Mercury.
For decades, radar data indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger spacecraft in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter every day and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country where you are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is also a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country where you are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is of a flawed romanticism.
Around the many turns of the road, the small bus runs along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost feels like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
It is here that the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about whom not much is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and have a very long life.
Ended by Lerik.
The small town plastronna with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not agree at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, as the road has only one path.
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision contest, and next year there will be the festival of the world's oldest people," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, the only museum of its kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old.
Here is my grandfather, he reached the age of 120 years.
Having a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Muslimov’s age seems more than questionable.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," Fatulayeva said.
The man would have been married three times and had 23 children.At the age of 136, he would still have conceived a girl.
Should Şirali Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades when calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the old man in Central Asia.
“Surprisingly old people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz explains, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the lack of documents, not to mention that there was no civil status register.
Each day a glass of butter
Nevertheless, it is a fact that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of Bible patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tour guide, explains that the Talysh have special genes.
Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it’s a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that the high-calorie meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink daily a glass of melted butter, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people?In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical for the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barbeque, whose content she beat tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two young children are also in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her hat hid long tresses of a dark blonde whom her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
The monthly pension is enough.
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything got better when the “beloved father” Heydar Aliyev took command.
The language of propaganda is astonishing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who has yet to rule his country as a dictator, knows almost no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He remained in power until 2003, after his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for her retirement, a sum that guarantees a good life in the region.
And maybe Mirzayeva’s long-grabbing son is right: “The elderly enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “human rights” omitted in the Constitution
The revolution in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the country’s deep fracture.
The Sharia Constitution is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president is not hungry for words full of emotions.
We need to succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but also especially to the Coptic Christians, to the Liberals, to the enlightened and secular Muslims.
Because all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They fear a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Morsi said, almost apologizing, he temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its own "to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles drafted in a hurry by the mostly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night round of force are indeed disturbing to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the bill provides that the jurisprudence is based on “the principles of Islamic law.”
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists use the vague formulation and the resulting legal manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia.
In any case, this suggests a newly introduced article stating that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted.The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its splendor radiates across the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee the legislative apparatus, which would de facto result in the subjugation of the judiciary.
Many aspects of the Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely preservation of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts were employed to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morality and values.”
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
This would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally questionable is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to “offend people.”
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to vote and which, according to his own words, will be the subject of a referendum among the Egyptians "very soon".
“The Revolution Rises”
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to overthrow the Sharia law before it comes into force.
“The revolution is reborn and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who came third in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El Baradei, said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the trash of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “putsch against democracy”.
“If he proclaims a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atonished," Khaled Ali, a politician and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
In addition, several judges have announced they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its invalidity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other bank of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
“Purify our country,” they asked Morsi, saying, “the Qur’an [was their] Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where it all began, would soon have led to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
That’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said the opponents of the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, had expressed themselves loud and strong.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide through the polls what direction the country should take.
The project of the Islamists will surely win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once.”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That’s why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures violate the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda said.
Democracy cannot work without civil society.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watches the battle between different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could pay off.
A demonstrator at Tharir Square warns: “You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control.”
Norwegian Rakfisk: Is this the world’s most odorable fish?
The five million people who live in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country’s success be related to the local people’s appetite for an extremely odorable fish?
Take advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most popular dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It’s snowing, the landscape is spectacular – and that odor, ubiquitous, permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprayed with salt and fermented in water for a period of time – depending on the smell you want it to breathe out – which can go up to a year.
When darkness sets in and it’s cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter also known as "Rakfisk General", who manages the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and swallow a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
Drinking kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid making it pass under your nose, it’s not bad – it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in waterproof water barrels, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive healthcare system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is considered something important, a vital, though odoring, element of Norway’s past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small slice of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not unpleasant to him.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this murder, they talk about the “July 22 incident.”
Norwegians find it hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of theirs could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and eyes of a translucent blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plate in hand.
We are, as you say, cautious people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet and don’t like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution – everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep its stock exchange ropes tight.
“As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
“Without forgetting the rakfisk,” she adds in a laughless laugh.
I stand under the snow and wait to buy me something to eat – I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent.
The smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them – or the most odoring of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a butterfly node, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
“These are our points, Havard.”
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, because of the abuse of aquavit.
Maybe it’s because of the fish.
Mexican Enrique Peña Nieto is in a difficult position.
As the incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico is bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are legion in normal time, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential shirt to become the new President at the head of the nation.
A difficult task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is going well, thanks to outgoing President Felipe Calderon’s results, but the country is plagued by a drug war that has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to this goal.
Before he joined the U.S. President, Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A highly populated and tentative state that envelops the capital.On its favorite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the Bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The localities attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new M Pena Nieto highways, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once cluttered and full of cracks.
Plaques with his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We rely on him to bring about lasting changes," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of Congress and Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who accuse the new president of lacking charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a great man of state and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more flagrant.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to rescue to fight the drug gangs that harass the neighborhoods, and violence against women is severe there.
In a devastated area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found, on the edge of a landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place sadly famous for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Critics of Pena Nieto say that at best he failed to stop the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
In the worst case, they accuse their administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this ruined neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me pictures of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version is of a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Señora Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been beaten, and the corpse rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old cowboy, a troublemaker, a crying woman.
They want us to accept what they say and be silent.
“But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives her shell on Saturday, she will bear a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been hit by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make it his priority during his term.
"I hope he will be as good as president as when he was governor," Olvera told Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained about ill-treatment, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the allegations of abuse that Bradley Manning might have been the victim of during his detention.
The trial is about Manning’s detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning’s seizure took place under extremely difficult conditions.
He is accused of stealing thousands of documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning -- accused of being the source of the largest leak of confidential information in the entire history of the U.S. military -- missed numerous occasions to complain of the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about his treatment.
The counter-interrogation — during a hearing, the defense filed a petition demanding that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment — took place a day after Manning testified about her desire to commit suicide during her detention.
The military intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were later published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source.
During Friday’s hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms the officers had filled in after their encounter with Manning, during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in prison was overall "very professional."
The forms do not state any complaints for ill-treatment, although officers have directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the issues mentioned.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after addressing concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise problems," Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special committee that had gathered to discuss suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his own protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from that status... so that I could enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for two months before being transferred to the military prison from the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he planned to commit suicide while in Kuwait and once fainted due to the heat.
He added that not being kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very anxious.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without companionship.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a blanket, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was contrary to the regulation.
Manning also specified that when he was trying to fall asleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards could not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so that he could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint over Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his Thursday testimony — that after being forced to sleep naked a night in his cell at Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning, during the call.
Manning testified that at no time was she allowed to cover herself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he had deduced from his guard's order that he should let go of his blanket that could have hidden his nakedness, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he had tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning would have told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to injure himself, but he had not.
That night, Manning testified that her underwear, tongs, and glasses had been removed from her cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will considerably reduce his sentence if he is to be found guilty in a martial court, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty for the least serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of public assets or documents, collusion with the enemy, leading to the unlawful publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defense-related information.
If all the accusers are detained, he receives life imprisonment.
The Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrete says Mexico-Americans find themselves trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two paths: one for the “Mexicanos” (“Mexicans”) and another for the “Extranjeros” (“Estrangers”).
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line to go.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the “Mexican” all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualification, like the one my friends in Boston use when they call themselves “Irish,” or my friends in New York when they call themselves “Italians.”
Then I became “Mexico-American.”
But here it was Mexico.
And in the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for any special qualification or trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in one or the other language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary of an indigenous, and I can’t lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Strangers" row.
I thought of that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite topics are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons Mexicans are pushing to stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to allied with the United States and Canada, and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against the drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought of the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to write down half of their territory to the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear — in the Mexican press, and among the elites — complaints about how Americans are infringing on their neighbor’s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that which the countryins with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our genealogy tree, a person, a relative or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And most often this person corresponded to a typical profile — a dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we should never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes confused, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they reject us as if we were inferior and not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed while they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we’t find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, as Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexican-Americans are upset with it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know don’t feel like they’re part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as fortune ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country to definitely visit and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, considering wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are ubiquitous, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You will have to do it yourself, friends.
It is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm .
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than I thought.
Old conflict, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist for who started, dozens of buildings have been dusted; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the Israeli metropolis, and the Holy City of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has blown everything up, and whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Per their struggle will intensify a little more.
Nevertheless, there are all the reasons to think that this could help them out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners.
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire agreed on November 21 isined, the fighting this week has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of having forced the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has suffered a crackdown.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed back the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of its rivals Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken action for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Members of Hamas rejoice and say that the rising Islamist curve revolves around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, through Syria, where Islamist-oriented rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Mohamed Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more readily entrusted to the public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hardline supporters will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in the box.
The Iron Dome missile interception system proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles were destroyed.
Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being at the origin of the latest wave of violence.
But most of all, Israel has thrived, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fires from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared from suicide attacks, notably thanks to the separation barrier that enters the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their international lawlessness.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicose party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman, in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the good side.
Why do Palestinians give them a state?
If they ruled the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It’s best to keep them behind that wall and hit them as soon as they get out of the head.
Per hardline supporters will win, but the Arab Spring may change.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be to address the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to a ceasefire, which is good-looking -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is destined to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories – a little like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic price.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains the one advocated by the reasonable people on both sides, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders an opportunity to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to work to end the movement of weapons to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in line with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming proposal of a pseudo-state to the UN.
Obama is also interested in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Neutral cigarette packages laws come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world premiere, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark green olive and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small letters on all the packages.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regulation in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message transmitted by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest rate of smoking in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pushed against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would revive black market trade, which would make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Dangerous consequences will arise from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre, of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, said the demand for cigarette buckets, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost before the Australian Supreme Court.
Ha said Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only annoyance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the segment of population targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising, sports sponsorship, and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you're working in tobacco marketing and you only have a small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the must-see place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noticed an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the effort to make a video, or is it a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulation in force rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court rulings — these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade deals with Australia.
A decision by the WTO is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada became the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures do not bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you store the package," said Victor El Hage when buying a package with a picture of a tumor in the mouth.
To be honest, the only reason that will make me stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in downtown Sydney, said the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the shelves.
“I used to take an hour to unload a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
"The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the topic of boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our kids – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
and yes.
and no .
But I will come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes very far,” he said.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After scrolling through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of “wishing to do something but failing to get into a satisfactory activity.”
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task though he would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time goes slowly.”
Depression can be very similar to depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we’re boring when it’s actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal “Perspectives on Psychological Science” in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an earlier experiment in which participants listened to on cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the next room, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said they were more annoyed than the other two groups – they had trouble concentrating, but didn’t know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or disturbing task, a break from attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you do a boring task, "like watching objects on a editing chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you torture yourself or chew yourself, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigot learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoving,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocorde voice, a boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Predisposition Scale to Boredom” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, “Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimuli.
In general, teenagers are rapidly overwhelmed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted 400 teens and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He found that 32 percent of teenagers getting bored at school and during their homework, while 23 percent getting bored when they were not at school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentages of boredom today, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” because children and adolescents don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can result in people taking absurd physical risks, betting or abusing certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers talk about a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Dullness is the way the brain has found to let you know you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation goes from one situation to another,” he said.
Your child not only learns how to have fun, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don’t think we should glorify boredom.
I do not think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant boiling that activities and technology generate is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom arouses an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy downtime.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and footballer in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana bullets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were aboard a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was sentenced to appear for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado’s vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving marijuana use have been classified without follow-up.
Police have stopped charging adults aged 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into effect in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own it.
Meanwhile, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are evolving so quickly that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, chief of the Aurora police station in eastern Denver.
The regulatory bodies of the state of Washington also raise many questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a licensing system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether you like it or not, is ahead of most states in marijuana regulation, first for therapeutic use and now for personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and it’s a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, admits Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, leaving a legal void of one year, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain pending: how to balance the state mandate that guarantees appropriate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis-selling stores within a radius of 30 km around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no harder places than urban areas to set up a licensed cannabis sales trade, in Seattle’s metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Cannabis Legalization, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, the chief of the police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the prosecutor's office) would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who own small amounts of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chef Oates said the police would enforce the new judicial rulings that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug dealers and traffickers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, “district attorney” Ken Buck embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, mainly to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are the subject of other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed a crime that, at the time of the events, was a recognised offence,” Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative to restrict marijuana consumption.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer allow adults to appear for possession of limited amounts.
County Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana possession cases without a follow-up.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time on continuing to enforce the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana consumption is not an easy thing.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials regarding marijuana legalization.
"This is a cultural barrier" with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, too, they’ve had a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana consumption at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are about to become a case of jurisprudence for drug legalization.
As advocates and state representatives anticipate a new border of legalized sales, they are waiting with concern for directives from the federal government, which still concepts marijuana sale and cultivation as federal crimes.
Defenders of marijuana legalization are hoping the Justice Ministry will give in.
Despite some mediated arrests of patients under therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales stores for therapeutic purposes to operate in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police are unlikely to knock down the doors to seize small bags of drugs, it’s a good bet that it’s opposed to licensed stores selling marijuana for personal use permitted by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana sales stores, even though this is only a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then find ourselves facing a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was misled and excluded from Oxford because I was a “Tory” (conservative).
It is not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I’ve always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a kind of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I settled at Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my suitcases, provoking the first scandal in my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left that university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated facetively that I had left after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I have fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been intimidated and was constantly bullied.
Not because of my name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my unfortunate father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential counselor to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why should we talk about this today?
And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded protection of their rights, as did those of gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Student Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political views.
They want a representative within the University’s Equal Opportunity Committee so that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right"), devoted to student politics, and depicting the "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
In particular, the student Joe Cooke, former president of the "Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) ", who moves in a Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chrome-headed cannon.
In other universities, conservative students say they’re being treated as goats sending out the increase in tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association," told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing leftist party in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is “uncomfortable,” and Stephanie Cherill, 19, OUCA president, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
"This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one to think like that during my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and with a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was very virulent.
A year earlier, the university voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an honorary title, due to the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the reception week, when the new students got acquainted with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm of Tory students, but they also it.
It was as if the policy on striking minors, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was the victim of was a translation into English of French texts from the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was able to handle it easily.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he tweeted.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that evening, I sat alone and then felt a slight stroke on my shoulder.
It was a second-year student of English studies, named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said gently.
I am afraid it will be so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It’s already hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’ll be even harder for you.
Most of the young Tory claim to be Labourists.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This strategy has failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political science and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students took the refrain.
I was dirty, dirty.
“How do the Tories make love?” asked one of them.
They are hitting each other, aren’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I just have a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after night fall?
Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started taking the shuttle between Oxford and my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my family and more open-minded city friends.
I told my dad that I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But this is the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They’t do that, not in the city of the bellowers.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I’m sure it’s for you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a headed work session the following week, when another history professor suggested the world’s most seriously, that I was “an enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Shining inside of shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and treated them as “old fools.”
The rest was of short duration.
It was my father who struck the last nail of my Oxford coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed taped in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcases and took the first train to London.
I never returned there.
You can call me a wet chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoys an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him at the inauguration of "Valentino: A Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high fashion models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the cornerstone of a story whose sole protagonist is “he lord” Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, we find an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving the kingdom.
“At least, they don’t crush their cigarettes on your gorgeous carpet like some pop stars do,” said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," says the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past-time beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the fashion designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Plaza de España in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His spirit was seen and felt in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, every guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Line of Nobility Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He likes people who are high and with the biggest titles and they love him too.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous seventy-meter-wide podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the role of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a dream "publik" wearing Valentino's main creations, such as the cutter Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "The Night", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among these models are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of her clients say that Valentino’s first clothes are like the first love, “unforgettable.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
“It’s a gift he gave me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the fashion designer’s musees.
"I prefer him to everyone else for his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimates our beauty," she said.
I love the colors he uses, they are bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Arenberg’s princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a model Valentino.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses.
This was finally possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying shirt, a draped bustier and a drop-down deco.
"It was a dream made reality," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess of Arenberg preserves the couturier's evening dresses with "the utmost care, because a evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries."
The “King” of Fashion
The grand final of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his couturiers) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl incrustations, twelve kinds of different toenails and a four-and-a-half-meter trail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the high-coat of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
Obstructed for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, calmness, careful and perfect appearance have always jumped into my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my best friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If you are a princess...
The world’s toughest job: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through the steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It has to work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the earth's intestines solidifies in contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulfur rocks, weighing a total of 70 kilograms, he placed them in two bamboo baskets that he loaded on his shoulders through the steep paths.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, in a turtle-like shape, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as it happened to a French tourist who fell deadly into the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur extracted.
Once on the top, there is a path between tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and wearyly carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters of altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilogram of sulfur.
She then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) as this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” says Anto, who generally makes three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it’s three times what it would earn in the fields.
"The miners' income is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job wasn’t that hard, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: “I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her back to Java for her to convert to Islam.”
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At age 27, he spent three of his life challenging danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the bill even though he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
That’s the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
Destroyed by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waitress or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy piece of wood with other bearers, rises every day at two o’clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to sprinkle at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the dark.
Challenging the darkness, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not touch a penny of the 30,000 rupees (2,50 euros) increase per camera, in addition to the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros), which the guard of this natural park charges tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his three sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps miners into the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which obviously their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, knee and shoulder pain, deformed by the weight of the baskets are added.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only load 50 kilograms.
Every day, his companions and he extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult professions in the world: the one done by the human mules of the Kawah Ljen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans throw the responsibility for this lack of children on career, stress, and the cost of accessing property.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an ad for mint pills, but despite this, or thanks to it, the video spread like a dust trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The words come from a rap band that uses local references like “Let’s put a polichinelle in the drawer” to mock Singapore’s birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to attract attention to the issue in a fun way through this advertisement.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music for people to fulfill “their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we have been able to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth rate, so we felt it was a topic we needed to address.
We knew the government had tried several things like launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we thought the following thing: what could be more creative in solving this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 The children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Division, says this is due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family-building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriages and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decline in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially towards Chinese who are accused of pushing wages down and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore experienced last year’s worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale wins a lot of success.
However, authorities are concerned that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much faster than the larger ones.
This makes it much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he acknowledges that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously putting sticks in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards raising the national birth rate, discussing with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they won’t have much effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that's why people postpone it for later," says a young senior.
Others may have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to dispose of my money and my time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress, and the cost of accessing property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, it is Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online.
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under the age of 16?
How do you apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he exposes himself to by broadcasting on the Internet events that he would not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term “something very personal” on a personal level with “password and username” when they applied it to social networks.
“I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I post pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share any of my photos or someone who would do the idiot,” he said.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family members.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just post them,” he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends, quickly,” he says.
He said he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He will also not trust anyone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t bother me because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the young boy, no one advanced him or asked for his address or phone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences known today as cyberbullying are not alien to the young boy.
One of my friends was hacked on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close her account.
“He only passed it on a private profile.”
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I was angry or angry.
“Even if I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a means of searching for information but, with the emergence of these sites, the rules of the game have changed," she mentions.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master’s degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book “Digital Natives and Immigrants,” uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the theme is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what is or is not appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she said.
Next, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others say about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask others for permission to identify them?
And also, do everyone need to know what you do every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
"Out of the internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and educational adviser, states that it is essential that parents carefully read the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an Internet account.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they should not talk to strangers.
UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven delegates present.
Efe has repeatedly attempted access to the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of UNASUR Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially that it would be disclosed after the summit closed, then said it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government’s website.
When asked about the text, they that its content had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollante Humala in brief press releases.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the no-sound video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulating among the journalists was that given by press officials from some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document disclosed during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media that demanded more important information.
Later, the Peruvian presidency sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd South American-Arab Summit (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although it was requested with instance by the press, it did not broadcast the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities attempted to set up secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the collection of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICC’s decision to hear the advocates of both sides in the trial that Lima filed against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we have today before this international court," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international tribunals,” said President Piñera, giving a handshake to President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICC came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The delegate read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of $17 million of investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place “important steps to the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits.”
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, cheap internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and see a better future for our peoples,” concluded President Humala.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” he said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a larger connection with Ecuador although he did not give the most detailed details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," of which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbors is another topic discussed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega next Saturday in Mexico to quietly discuss the maritime dispute through a ruling of the ICC requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country," he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they planned to attend the takeover of power by the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen defence dialogue and consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which “South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe.”
President Correa, who participated in the sixth summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "had talked during World War II" and during other conflicts, "but that they are now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the UNASUR member countries.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andes, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make part of the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador has expressed his support for the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who shake our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret his decision, as he himself did not betray his principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice that has demanded that he submit to an interrogation on his territory regarding a alleged sexual offence while “the Swedish legislation itself allows it to do so by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange’s mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“It affects everyone’s health,” he concluded.
Correa said that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the assignment of a safe-trip that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he stressed that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities as Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings in different European instances,” he said.
And he thinks that “if Britain granted the backstop tomorrow, it would end.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation permits, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was “medianity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he congratulated himself that it was not this kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, instead of promoting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within Unasur at least until the next election, arguing that the body "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers “perfectly relevant” the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua’s maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to move forward together.
They need to be solved in their entirety to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the proper resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and said it was "beneficial for Latin America to refer to international instances if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it may be."
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although this is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa has assured that if he loses the primary elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
“My political movement believed it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, this will be my last term and I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will do so too.
“That’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chavez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when the test confirmed he was HIV-positive.
"It's like the sky fell on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his harshness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), where he found himself in 1994 after numerous battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were a lot of doubts, little treatment choices and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was voiceless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immune system damage presented by patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for non-drug users: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those reaching a CD4 rate of 500.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would get a HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25, “as long as he remains under control, he can live up to 75 years without problems,” the scientist explained.
In order to bring this progress back into its context, it is necessary to know that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), but it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients recorded on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths by May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
The problem is not access to treatment.
This is what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never missed medication, the problem is that patients arrive at very advanced stages because they do not know they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
He gives us an indisputable fact “nine out of ten patients arrive while they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who ask for it.”
Specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to take his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better to break out three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
So far, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that one can live like everyone else, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who embraced the cause of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packs of a hundred, it is very good, but it results, that today, some still do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?" asked with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, guidance advisors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question teenagers don't want to hear, the journalist assures.
He proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counter, but that they be found in the public toilets and in the places that young people attend.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Events in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the 4th state in the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections occur through sexual contact, 6% through blood and 2% through perinatal contact.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, as for every recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A ruling ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the Vitro Group’s debt restructuring agreed through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario creates a detrimental precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighboring country and having solvency problems.
It would therefore seem that the survival procedures of the companies permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the star-flag, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment issued last June 15 by judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the case judge points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are formal commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment established that without the intercompanies vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro’s subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
Here are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts had been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Failures.
Furthermore, what is certain is that since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any way the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the U.S. courts, i.e. “value funds” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote was 45 votes against 37.
A statement omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation it has encountered since 2008 without stopping at the severe economic crisis that faced the United States, impacting costs to the country.
For now, the company of the González Sada family will appeal to the same appeal court for the vote to take place in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will claim non-prosperity and require the trial to be reviewed by a higher instance, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The worst part is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae (“Friend of the Court”) detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this exempted it from conventions signed by both countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it notes that the country has adhered to the UN Commission on International Trade principles, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvencies, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they assommed Vitro and they assommed the country.
The general balance
The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Aviation Company against the former chief of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silenced for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviators' Union has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal claim against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically denied having provided information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic about an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw 198 million pesos from the fideicomission F/589 of the bank IXE on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They siege the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend at a University of the Caribbean amphitheatre, a group of domestic and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of Great Wall country products, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast zone to oppose the monumental project that is located in part on protected areas and represents the largest of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
The government has raised a Senate requirement to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Commercial Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already in ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was well done that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long term homeopathy
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, Homex entered the stock market for 500 million pesos.
This issuance of securities is the first of four issuances for which they offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competition
Integrated by the leading IT companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, a new competitive consortium has just emerged, targeting the Central and South American cluster software services market.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
Basketball globe-trotter "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of local basketball history as large as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a cerebral hemorrhage sentenced him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for over 60 years, whether as a player of lower leagues, a player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I've worn several basketball hats throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit from Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Basketball is my whole life.
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes this claim.
The walls of his home, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind him of his unusual itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the Heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those that remind him of his passage as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
“These were my best years, those of which I had the most benefit because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967 onwards, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
This has been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year that Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been running here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, “I have a tough player for you, he measures two meters.
Do you want it?”
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the grand manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy’s duties in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian referee hadn’t made us play the last game again,” Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we kicked the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only made up of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the 90 World Cup due to a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but they gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like “Canito” Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan-American Games in Mar del Plata, we won gold against all predictions.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as Piculín did.
And that without considering his trajectory in the various leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is very difficult to say.
We had a good team consisting of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I like the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest achievement within the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you still have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while this is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for executives, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
I generally listen to music, watch clips from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a scrupulous, fearful and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the scrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played her wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her press agent, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life deeply," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman made himself known on television in the role of an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and he brought her home.
He also starred in two comedies that stayed shortly on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his film roles are critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously disgusting J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated worldwide speculation and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made Dallas the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.’s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had pregnant her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what would be needed as an epitaph for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be written: “Here is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only part he has lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as a "immense man, both on the small screen and in life."
He is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is underway, the channel said.
So far, neither Warner nor TNT have announced how Hagman’s death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who became famous with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the scenes of New York theaters in the early 1950s and served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs “Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.”
"I have not written anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told the press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist concerned patients.
“I advise them, I restore them confidence, I come with them when they come for surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a moment, but it’s going to go well.”
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and participated in several campaigns.
A course on the “End of the World” has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a lesson on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hammer there: the end of the "great count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, which many people refer to as evidence of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what awaited him in the following months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal abyss that some have dubbed “the Armageddon of Debt” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would unleash.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey.
If you analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and tell it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only teacher to give classes on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We are analyzing this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On Pennsylvania State University’s main campus, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled “The End of the World.”
"We're adding '2012' to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world't disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students have to study, create projects, and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," Restall said about his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received emails several weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of psychology and nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a class that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students surveyed, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zegle, a 21 year old graduate student from Temple, West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I admit that there is an apocalyptic-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has sparked the rise of this speculation.
“In other parts of the globe, people don’t think about that,” he assures.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew there were classes on “the end of the world.”
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it was an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately begin to think about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many have told us that they thought they were going to “the end of the world” parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
