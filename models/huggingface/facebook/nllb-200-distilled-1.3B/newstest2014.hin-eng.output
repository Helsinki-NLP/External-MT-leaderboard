The black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to fix the crumbling highway system, many people are looking for a solution in a small black box that fits neatly on the dashboard of your car.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by the motorist and transmits that information to authorities, has become the subject of a controversial effort by Washington and the State Planning Office to revamp an outdated system to fund America's major roads.
Even a boring task like highway planning in general has suddenly become a topic of intense debate and lively coalitions.
Libertarians have met with environmental groups to gather support for allowing the government to use these black boxes - keeping track of the miles you drove, and possibly the location you drove - and then using that information to draft tax bills.
The tea party is a mess.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned about various privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move to a system in the next decade where the driver pays for every mile traveled on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
It is a truly essential commodity for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not", says Hassan Ikhratta, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to start tracking every mile driven by motorists in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund is nearly bankrupt, funded by taxes paid by US citizens at gas pumps.
Americans don 't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now a car runs more miles in a gallon of gas than before.
The federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, at 18.4 cents per gallon.
Because of the high price of gas, politicians avoid raising a penny in taxes.
"Gas taxes are not sustainable at all", says transport policy expert Lee Munich at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the mileage payment system.
He says, "In the long run, this will be the most rational option".
Vonk calls this a mileage - based user fee.
Not surprisingly, the idea appeals to urban liberals, as it could, for example, change taxes to change the way cars are driven, which could help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are eager for the system as they develop strategies to meet targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But even the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (R - PA), considers the black box the most viable long - term option.
Independent sellers at the Region Foundation also favor paying per mile by the driver.
"It's not just taxes that are going into blind alley", said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been endorsed by two former US transportation secretaries who in their 2011 report graced Congress with moving towards pay-per-mile.
The US Senate approved a $90 million test project last year that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But acting on the concerns of rural legislators, who represented individuals who had to walk long miles to work or to the city every day, the House leadership abolished the motion on the spot.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most interested is Oregon, which has enlisted 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charge instead of the gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
The I-95 Alliance, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not receive support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed in the cars of 50 volunteer drivers, drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
"Concern about Big Brother and other similar things was the main problem", says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people wanted.
As the trial progressed, ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be fairly easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices".
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanageable technology infrastructure that would inevitably have to be spread out to keep track of every person's daily comings and goings.
Nevada is among many states that are working hard to get affordable technology that allows the state to get details of how many miles a car is driving per day, but not where and when it is driving.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, where drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing has attracted highway planners because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at fixed time intervals.
"If you don't track people's speed and location, they're more likely to adopt this method", said Ryan Morrison, chief administrator of True Mileage.
There have been some major errors in these initial programmes of the State.
There are also very inexpensive and minimally invasive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different choices.
They can choose GPS equipped or not GPS equipped.
Or again, one can choose not to take any device, but instead pay a fixed fee based on the average miles to be covered by the residents of the state.
Other places hope to sell this concept to concerned citizens by offering more convenience instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are working to develop a taxing device that would also allow for paying parking meter fees, provide "pay-as-you-drive" insurance, and build a collection of real-time motion data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document states, "Motorists will be attracted to participate because of the benefits it will bring".
However, some transport planners wonder if perhaps all the talk about pay per mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said Congress could very easily deal with the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising gas taxes.
Drivers of hybrid or other cars may also be charged an additional one time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work", said Randy Rentsheller, the commission's director of legislative and public affairs.
If we do this, millions of drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, he died of drowning.
However, his friend has been taken into custody by the police for hiding the deceased's belongings.
The police have submitted the final report of the death investigation to the court.
On August 26, police recovered the body of Zahid Iqbal, a resident of Padasahi Bagh in Jhelum Daria.
His family had accused his friends of killing him because his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
The report said that the deceased's phone and SIM card were checked and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman said that she had been given the phone by a relative, Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of the late Zahid.
Ruhal had gone to bathe in Jhelum with Zahid after the Jumma prayers on 25th August.
Zahid unbuttoned his clothes and put all his belongings on the side while Rahel went to the other side to smoke.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only his clothes.
Rahel looked for Zahid, but he was not found.
He picked up his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and put them away for his own use.
He did not tell anyone that Zahid had drowned.
The police told the court that Zahid died of drowning and the post mortem confirmed it.
However, Ruhal has been detained under Section 404 for concealing facts and the deceased 's belongings.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, known for his bungee parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old woman.
This was revealed by his family friend Martel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been prime minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Blusconi when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
This is Francesca, whose relationship with Balrusconi was said to be a sham.
Berlusconi's close friend and bang-bang girl Martel Polanco has revealed that she too was invited to the secret wedding.
The ceremony has been held for three weeks.
When asked on Italian Radio 2 what would happen if they got married, Polanco said that they were already married.
It was not a public ceremony.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former Prime Minister 's house.
No one can tell you anything else.
She did not go to this wedding, though.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
The two got married about three weeks ago, i.e. on 8 or 9 October.
About eight months ago, Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than herself, became engaged.
Berlusconi had based his decision on solitude to avoid the crowds.
In the lowlands, the rain continued intermittently between sunrise and sunset.
With this, a cold wave has started in the entire valley.
The cold can be gauged from the fact that the minimum temperature has reached -4.8C in Srinagar, -0.2C below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8C in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the entire state.
At the same time, the strategically important Srinagar - Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic due to rain and snowfall.
There is heavy snowfall on the Jozila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of this season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
Due to the activity of the western disturbance, snowfall began in the high mountainous areas of the valley at dawn on Wednesday and rains in the lowlands continued until late evening.
The cold also affected the normal life of the people.
People stayed indoors to avoid the cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply was also shut down in many areas.
Srinagar recorded a maximum daytime temperature of 13.7C (4°F) below normal.
At the same time, in Jammu, the cold has increased at night due to heavy rain with strong winds on Wednesday morning.
Minimum temperature of 16.6 and maximum of 27.0 degrees Celsius was recorded in Jammu.
According to the Meteorological Department, the effect of the Western disturbance is starting to decrease and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lots, Director, Srinagar based Meteorological Department, the weather is likely to remain dry in the valley from 1st to 7th November.
Asaram, who was jailed on sexual assault charges, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
Media coverage argued by Asaram is portraying him as Dracula, a blood-sucking child, but the court rejected his demand to curb media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P Sathivam refused to order a ban on media reporting about Asaram, saying that he had seen every word reported in the media and saw no reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others.
Earlier, Asaram 's lawyer had accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
But the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to intervene in the case, saying that they had other options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram 's demand to block media coverage.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case ever.
The group operator of the mall paid the relevant financial institutions by deducting TDS but not into the government treasury.
By doing so, he kept the TDS money with him.
The group was raided by the investigation team from Mumbai on 17th October along with the Jaipur investigation team.
In the investigation of the same episode, it was found that the trader had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team on Thursday launched an income tax survey on this group.
The risk of account sealing was raised by raids and surveys on the group of the mall operator about 15 days ago.
The businessman, outraged by this action, has made it clear to the officials of the Income Tax Department that he is not ready to pay the Rs. of TDS to the Department yet.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them.
The investigating officers in the case have clarified that recovery will be done by sealing the accounts in case of non-payment.
The demand for sweets increases in view of Diwali.
In view of this, the sale of inferior and counterfeit maves increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against fake mawas and chemical sweets.
The department seized a spoon of Rs. 70,000 from the Mawa and Quetta Colony in Madhya Pradesh.
With the increasing demand for sweets in the market, the demand for Mavi from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The information was received by the department to bring the lowly mother - in - law from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
The shipment of raw materials is being ordered from the transport garage in Nagpur.
The department seized the mave, which was valued at Rs. 70,000.
Fear of action did not justify anyone.
The department destroyed it as unclaimed property.
The department raided the Jitendra Caters in Quetta Colony and recovered spoons worth about Rs.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to make the gloss and longevity.
The sample will be sent to the lab.
The Department's Co-Commissioner, SS Deshmukh said that the campaign to catch chemical sweets and low quality and fake beans will continue.
The department has informed that the campaign will be further accelerated in the next few days.
Consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the confectionery businessmen to make sweets from good milk, maize.
The department has appealed to people to be careful about counterfeit sweets and snacks.
He was greeted at the airport by 42 select senior leaders of the BJP.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for a BJP-organised Consolation Yatra.
The Consolation Yatra is a BJP exercise to embalm the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is noteworthy that a total of seven blasts took place in Patna on 27th October during the Hunkar rally of Narendra Modi.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts had intended to cause a riot during the rally, so as to cause more casualties and create an atmosphere of terror in the state.
The terrorists ' plan failed, but the blasts killed six people.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have taken a journey from Thursday with bone - kalsh from their village.
On November 5th, their remains will be flung together in the Ganges at Patna.
As part of this visit, a Consolation Yatra is being organized.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of the victims of the blasts and meet their families from 7 am on Saturday.
During the visit, he will also present a check of Rs. 5 to the relatives of the deceased.
This financial assistance has already been announced by the BJP.
The Indian team, excited by the explosive victory in the last match, will aim to capture the series with a win when it lands in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs washed out by rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series and their batsmen gave a record win, tying the series 2-2.
Team India has twice achieved the target of over 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of crossing the team's boat will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak and the biggest target is also dwarfing it.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have high hopes for Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as the opening is concerned, the team has got such an opener pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar that is making the rest of the batsmen's work easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great opening partnership, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
With the impressive performance of Virat Kohli at number three, he is considered the future Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have called him even better than Sachin.
Virat, who will turn 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India has won 16.
He has an average of over 80.00 in pursuit of the target and has emerged as a top finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in a strong form, but over-reliance on these three can be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened the account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, Bangalore can be a lifeline for him in the ODI.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially Captain George Bailey, have impressed with their performance.
He is also being sought in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
Phil Heung and Aaron Finch, however, have not made an impact in the opening.
The absence of Mitchell Johnson in bowling could be a huge blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has been performing well in the series so far, has been sent home for the Ashes series.
BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of this sham peace.
Citing intelligence reports, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing hard to infiltrate its training camps with nearly 2000 militants.
For this he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan is even more troubled after the failure of the separatists ' plan to stir up the people in Kashmir and wreak havoc on a large scale.
Citing the visit of the separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lt Gen Zahir ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb sarghas Hafiz Saeed and Saeed Salahuddin had assured that terrorism would be given a wind in 2014.
Pakistan is serious about fulfilling this promise.
The killing of soldiers at the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Calling the demand to abolish the army privileges in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that it is also anti - people to speak like this until there is lasting peace in the state.
They give breath to anti - patriotic elements.
He stressed that the leaders' statements which would demoralize the army, security forces should be stopped.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on American alert
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, has announced that he is prepared to travel to Berlin to present evidence to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to their activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straub Belle, met Mr. Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has been granted asylum to speak about witnessing in Germany.
The MP, in a letter presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Mr Snowden, said: "While the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government treats dissent as a party - change, and offers no defence against what is an attempt to criminalize political speech with charges of hooliganism".
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that he could persuade the US government to drop criminal charges against him with the support of the international community.
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice involve theft from intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, German Interior Minister, told online Zeit: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we have to find ways to make it happen".
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after claims that the NSA bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who chairs the parliamentary committee overseeing intelligence, said that if there was an opportunity to accuse Mr Snowden as a witness "without completely ruining relations with the US and putting them in danger", it should still be taken.
Mr. Strauss-Behle, a member of parliament from the Green Party of Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was on his way to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bello said that, according to a former NSA contractor lawyer, if they left Russia, Snowden would not be able to return to Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany, he would be "safe" there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote that he had been forced to leave his home because of "a terrible and continuous campaign".
However, he said the world was happy and overwhelmed by the wide response "to his work of political expression".
World citizens - including the United States - as well as high officials have condemned the revelation of an irresponsible system of widespread surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carry-on luggage storage for passengers on board its aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can carry a full compartment.
The new carry - on charge is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said they'll charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to get riders to take care of the charge in advance.
"We don't want to charge that", he said.
Airlines started charging for first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid the toll are filling as much as they can in the carry-on baggage which is stashed in the overhead compartment, meaning that this compartment often has less space.
Fees are a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said this new charge isn't really about raising money.
It's about Frontier that for the most loyal customers, it's become increasingly difficult to find a replacement for the overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay this.
That means that the next person in line may have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a border gate can get a bag for free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before they reach the gate.
Frontier's new carry - on fee will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who want service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seen by many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not even touched the carry - on bag fee though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first introduced carry-on charges three years ago, and partner discount Allegiant Air followed.
Another airline with such a fee is Hungary 's Wizz Air, which airline consultant J. Sorensen said tracks add-on fees.
He said Spirit 's carry - on fee brings in $50 million a year which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew in Spirit and was surprised passengers faced unusual baggage fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was seamless", he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and see out at a fight gate.
"The plane was full and he climbed it lickety-split".
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier says that any traveler who takes a soda, or juice, can keep the whole can, and it will give away free coffee only once.
It'll still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but after passenger complaints seven months later they backed down and no other major airline there followed suit.
Frontier's move to charge a carry - on fee if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is its latest attempt to drive customers towards its own website.
The airline pays the online travel vendor Orbitz like $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
That is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier has moved ahead in this area, however.
In September, many began to offer more than half of the frequent flyer miles to customers who had purchased from these individuals from an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced the mileage award to 25 percent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn you 250 miles.
It also allows sole passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but it's losing business and money.
Revenue fell by 9 percent and its flight capacity was down by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
They're trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the sale of Republic Airlines.
The NSA blamed "internal error" instead of hackers for the website crash.
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website had been down for a few hours due to some technical glitch, not due to hackers as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error during a pre-set update", the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that the interruption was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
A spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that there was "absolutely no" compromise with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one activist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed in such a way that a large amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not aimed at penetrating the internal network of the target system.
The former top secret NSA, once dubbed "No Agency Like This", has become the subject of public discussion and bitter criticism in recent months after the revelation of a large volume of foreign and domestic espionage programs - stolen and leaked from the agency by the collectively disgraced former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
Due to the growing controversy about the agency, there was speculation after the incident last night that it was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The beautiful expression was presented in line with the plot of 'Another Dronacharya' which shows harmony in the Dvapara era and today's conditions.
It showed in what shackles a guru is bound to walk the wrong path in today 's perspective.
The play was launched by Chief Guest MLA Prabhu Dyal Valmiki, Vice President of the Canton Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansa and Shakti Singh in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College.
The play showed the similarity of the circumstances of Dravidar age Dronacharya and present - day professor Arvind.
The drama directed by Anil Sharma featured Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bechain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Gajala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun etc. who did a great job of doing justice to the characters.
The lighting in the play was done by the young colorist Jitendra C. Raj and the set was designed by Hemant Kumar.
The ceremony was followed by presentation of various awards to literary and cultural personalities on behalf of AAPTA.
It was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department, Charan Singh V.V., Senior Journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Colorist Jitendra C. Raj.
The functionaries of the Executive Committee included Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi etc.
Bombardier 's profits decline as aircraft deliveries, orders fall
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, as its train unit fell in the third quarter and contract issues were under pressure from lower aircraft orders and deliveries.
Montreal - based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or provide an update on issues the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service from next September.
Since the first flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it has only been flown three times, raising the question whether the test phase is on track or not.
The result fell below forecast and the stock has sent the Toronto Stock Exchange sliding by more than 8 per cent.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, downgraded its stock rating on Thursday from "mat" to "sector performance" after the stock was up over the next one or two quarters.
"While weak aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport", Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight test programme progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market will be suspicious of the programme.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company 's claims about the new jetliner 's fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as of now firm orders for the CSeries are in the mid - 177s.
403 total orders and commitments available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudouin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet was put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the event was going ahead as scheduled.
"The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than predicted", Bowdoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were also scheduled during the aircraft's interval.
Each manufacturer makes a different schedule.
We decided to make a first flight and have an update period and that 's what we did.
That 'll be all through the flight program.
The remaining second batch of five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts believe customers are doubtful if a CSeries aircraft can begin operations in the first 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the Entry into Service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule - confirms our view that entry into service will be pushed to Q1/15", Dorsen said.

New research has shown that we work in the morning with complete honesty and dedication.
They do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But as the evening comes, we change our minds and we set aside the ideal and go against the rule.
In this research, researchers from Harvard University and David Ecklus School of Business at Utah have provided some interesting facts.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values in the morning when we are not stressed by work, but in the evening, we lose our integrity because of fatigue or increased pressure.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell if the point was higher on the left or on the right.
Participants were told that if they answered wrong instead of right they would be given money.
The experiment showed that the subjects who were tested between 8 and 12 am did not make any mistakes and got the correct answer.
The experimenters were found to deliberately misinterpret the results of their tests between 12 noon and 6 pm.
This led researchers to prove that the lust for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but by the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
The research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the thugs fled with their money.
The family has admitted the injured in a critical condition.

When Sundar protested, the thugs shot him in the stomach, injuring him.
The relatives and villagers who got the information admitted him in a hospital in Meerut in critical condition.
No report had been filed in the case as of the time of writing.
Let us know that three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Jasveer, a resident of Ammanulapur, was shot and injured by two thugs on a bike.
Besides these, the police have not been able to reveal many other recent cases.
Meanwhile, SO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents will be revealed soon.

Cocaine addict lawyer jailed for giving Mr Big secret information about police investigation
42 year old Basharat Ditta used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people might know about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court.
The top defense counsel, who informed Mr Big about the main police investigation because he was afraid people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
After Barasht Ditta, 42, compromised over his cocaine addiction, he provided sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", and hailed as a "top brief" by criminals, was arrested in 2011 at his home in Scarborough following a police surveillance operation, which he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Officers saw Scarborough, 32, with three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a Law Society dinner with his colleagues.
After detecting cocaine particles in Ditta 's hair, wallet and credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of Class A drugs.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people from Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 other individuals who were sent to jail after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, and over £200,000 in cash, during several raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals, as he was afraid that people would not know about his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was facing a defeat at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to possession of cocaine in the earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad times began when police investigating Scarborough discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives chased the suspect and saw him entering Ditta 's house and carrying a drug of more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer 's bin in the Black Golf Glove.
Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta after the drug was placed, who went out to dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
When the lawyer arrived at the house, he found that drugs had been placed there and that they had had nine conversations.
The court heard that after detecting traces of Class A narcotics in Ditta 's hair, wallet and credit cards, the trial found him a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said their discussions were a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove many credit cards from his wallet, but they were confiscated, and his hair samples were taken.
In the police interview he said that he ran his office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients called his home for legal matters.
After the arrested key persons told what the detectives knew about them, the court heard that Ditta used to call the heads of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had brought before.
On behalf of the prosecution, Annie White said: "The criminal lawyer should know best not to break the law".
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, over-engaging with his particular client.
We are not talking about the relationship of a common drug dealer, but rather about a dealer who is supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been, without a doubt, formal, because he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his limitations of lawyer - client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not insulting his profession but not honoring it.
She made a very close friendship with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and she allowed the settlement of her own free will.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta transformed himself from criminal advocate into a criminal at the same time he started getting drugs from organised criminals".
Due to his cocaine addiction he became overly compromised and much more vulnerable to the aims of leading members of organized crime groups who used him to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of honesty and instill trust and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this belief and tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit investigated Mr Ditta, finding him guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will search you and bring you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty - five other gang members were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a Q&A session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a death row client in the US, to have Muhammad Ali as her dinner guest and to have inequality be the inspiration for her work.
Kenya's press outraged over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying "It is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is to prevent Parliament from stripping the judiciary of its independence in the coming days?"
"This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - the operating company of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, as it is an organ of the government", and said banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send the MPs back", he said.
The new bill will give the government "strong control over the media", according to The Star newspaper, while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been "deeply shaken" and described the bill as cruel.
The bill is being passed as part of measures to strengthen national security following the September attack by an Islamist gunman at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media had aired security camera footage of the squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them purposefully looting the mall, which angered the Kenyan media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and media workers for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after a media outcry.
The new bill would impose fines of 2 crore Kenyan shillings on media companies and 1 million Kenyan shillings on individual journalists, with the additional risk of "de-listing" or denial of official press recognition.
The Tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single whip is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations".
It also said these measures could have a devastating impact on what is described as Kenya's "living blogosphere".
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do whatever they want.
Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew describes the Kenyan media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "no one will ever know".
"Leaved to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and drag us back to the era of hunting and gathering", he wrote.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced public anger.
In May he voted to reject cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission and restore a tax-free stipend of about 532,000 shillings a month, considered among the highest in the world.
The birthday of the wife of the richest Indian Mukesh Ambani is on November 1st, but as the clock struck 12 on the night of October 30, the whole of Jodhpur was buzzing with the birthday of Nita Ambani.
Earlier, the atmosphere of the celebration was completely formed by the performance of A.R. Rahman's team.
Rahman performed his signature songs in the musical night which began at 8 pm.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage to show off the beautiful colors of the dance.
About 32 charters arrived in Jodhpur for guests attending Nita Ambani's birthday.
Due to the limited parking space at Jodhpur Airport, the charter was parked in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW and Jaguar were ordered.
Sood said that the city has a cleanliness system, street lights have completely failed.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and Huda to run the Panchkula City Centre.
He has demanded that Panchkula abolish the Ghomkar completely.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that after the municipal elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors but they do not have the power to get the job done.
This has made the city councillors a dummy and the officials are acting on their own.
Sood said that the Municipal Corporation has crores of rupees but all the money is being collected by depositing it in banks as FD.
But no steps are being taken to invest the money in the development of the city.
VK Sood said the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
People living in the Ghaggar Par Sectors have been forced to live a hellish life for the past several years due to the creation of dumping ground in Sector 23.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground to Jhuriwala village for several years, but the people of Barwala area are already suffering from a serious fly problem.
He said that the health services and education system in the villages are in a very bad state.
No work has been started to date to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
The UN set new targets to combat poverty
The United Nations is about to begin work immediately on a new set of goals, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDD, which is due to expire in 2015, the Australian diplomat played a key role in advancing the Sustainable Development Goals just before the Sustainable Development Summit, which kicked off overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the Summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki - Moon said at the overnight summit that it was time to "rise above national interests".
"I am very pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the Universal Sustainable Development Goals", he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress under the Millennium Development Goals and will be integral to the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to fulfil our far-reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns grow as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambican founder President Samora staring down at him, thousands gathered in central Maputo for a rare public demonstration chanting peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability", said Vanessa de Souza, CEO of an investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her corporate outfit to a T-shirt printed in Portuguese with the words "We demand security" and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, clashes between government forces and Rae Namo have been reported almost daily, since more than 20 years before a peace agreement.
Rae Namo was once a notorious rebel of the movement initially supported by the then white - ruled Rhodesia and apartheid governments of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country 's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, with the discovery of the Northwest's vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves in Rio Tinto, Brazil, some of which could bring in more than $50bn in investment from companies including Eni, Brazil's well.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Rae Namo blame each other for the tensions.
The government launched the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, a traditional Rae Namo stronghold, says Rae Namo.
The attacks on former rebels and then the escalation of government forces attacked Renmo bases and Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, tried to kill Fernando Machaang, a spokesman for Renmo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Rae Namo for triggering the clash, accusing the troops of attacking.
President Armando Ghibouzhan has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakaima saw himself as a "loser" "whatever his forces remain to try to prove that he can impose his own judgment on the government".
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist they want to avoid war.
Mr Mahang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled by RNMO but has since become a matter of concern again.
He told the FT that the deal was not being honored by Free Limo.
Our vision is to return to settlement negotiations, but seriously", said Mr. Mahang.
The last talks between the two sides did little to ease tensions in a series of conflicts this year.
"It 's about two big men (Gibuzhan and Dhaka) fighting side by side", said Yusuf Khan, a lecturer and Mozambican expert at the London Open University.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor are they necessarily willing to make concessions.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about boycotting the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
The vote share of Rae Namo has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Rae Namo member from the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mahang says Mr. Zibuzhanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country 's democracy.
"He does not want multiparty democracy, he does not want to give up the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want transparent elections", said Mr. Mahang.
What kind of capability Rae Namo has is not clear, but it is a major North South Highway where he has conducted disruptive hit and run tours on police stations and vehicles.
Most of the clashes are in the province of Sofa La Henna, several hundred kilometers north of Jomaputo, which hosts the port of Beira, which miners, including Rio Tinto and the Valley, rely on to export coal.
The railway suspended its experiment for about a week in Rio in June after a threat to attack the RNMO line.
When asked if Ray Namo would be able to repeat this threat, Shri Mahangvinit was almost speechless.
Ray Namo "things were not going well in Mozambique which the international community wanted to warn", Mr Mahang said.
The instability of the government has added to the frustrations, says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who heads an independent media company, and many others who are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and the recent spate of kidnappings.
"People are the government and the president, the people responsible for the future of the country, and think he should be the one to find solutions to the problems, " he says.
Omar Sultan, a demonstrator, people still want the stability.
"Nobody cares about Ray Nimo and free limos, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets", he said.
Children should be taught "myths and legends as models for the author's way of life".
Thor's stories could show that "no match for subtle tricks in brute force", while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths are also "exceptionally far from wild and in some cases even obscene and would not be appropriate to teach in schools", advocated Cross Lee Holland as one of the age appropriate tasks of "careful selection".
"I find it surprising, in America, that myth and folklore are already a part of the education field", he said.
I've been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more enlightening" and it is "a new turn" for children, with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and co-wrote the Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folk tales, said: "You can have many intentions but it's best to keep it out of sight".
The big difference between writing for an adult and writing for an adult is that there is a need for some sense of hope.
Because everything is simplified or comes to a happy ending, but it's an innate sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted rather than being told than revealed through a story.
Not showing old base.
Dialog Associate, Gumarvi: After serving in the Police Department in Gumarvi for 32 years, Head Constable Om Prakash retired.
On the occasion, the employees and officers of the Police Department organized a farewell party.
Om Prakash is a resident of Bhapral village of Bhani Bhapral Gram Panchayat.
He did better in his tenure.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker is a great way to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival.
People may argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: About a hundred years ago, comedian Frank Faye, who served as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the audience in a conversational fashion.
The quest for Fey has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
Conceived and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute Caroline's, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge successes, to the point where they became too big to play in clubs", Hirsch says.
We have created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefit for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as shows coming to smaller networks like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll, who rose to prominence with the deep-cable sitcom (FXX's hilariously rocky fantasy - football-themed "The League"), now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshall the Shell with Shoes on".
Other young comedians with different voices, including Kroll and Slate (the very different, disillusioned Anthony Jeselnik, the satirical, ethnically - focused W. Camaw Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg started out as a standup comedian, but has become a noted television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting will be held at the Town Hall in the heart of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry 's work", Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down the alley between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continues to fall to $ 96 a barrel
Oil prices continue to fall as a report of Friday's worrying over supply offsets a strengthening power-hungry manufacturing sector in China.
The benchmark for December deliveries was down 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in late morning electronic trading in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract has fallen 5.8 percent down for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
The adequate supply of crude oil has been weighed against the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a strong demand suggests an increase in activity, as shown by two reports on Chinese manufacturing on Friday.
This suggests that growth may continue to strengthen China 's economic recovery after falling below 7.8 percent in the third quarter of a two decade period.
Brent crude, also a benchmark for international crude used by US refiners, fell 26 cents from $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
The court blocked action on the New York Police Department's pause and sports policy.
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked changes to the New York Police Department's pause and sports program requiring a judge's order and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court of Appeals 2nd and Judge Shira Schindler has said the judge 's decision will be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge ruled in August that it violated the Constitution by preventing people in Nagar and excluding them from their schedule of questioning.
The city police department has appealed its findings and its remedial order, including the decision to allocate a monitoring to help change its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the request for migration on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeals has held that because he compromised the need for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in part of a series of media interviews and deviated from the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges by publicly misrepresenting him, the judge should therefore be removed from the case, statements criticizing the court should be held publicly accountable.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its break and sports program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes including economic reforms in policies, training and oversight, and she has ordered a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some campuses where most closures occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of Nagar is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The pause and play device has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
Leisure and sports policy in some form has been around for decades, but has been recorded to prevent dramatic increases in the number of mostly black and Hispanic men, from 684,330 to an all-time high in 2011 under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men all minorities and became a class action case.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's break and sports program have said that ending inappropriate behavior will shape a more reliable and effective police force and can influence how others use police department policy.
Opponents say the changes will lower police morale, but will not solve a wider problem of crime, waste of money and a police force under pressure after being shrunk by thousands of officers over the past decade.
The judge noted that the break and end for sports was not constitutional, but improved the NYPD's implementation of the stop.
The training was attended by a large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts.
During the seven days, all the participants were given information on various subjects including tent pitching, flag pole.
The training is being carried out in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Roy and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are spreading the spirit of unity by joining in the All - Faith Prayer.
Camp Principal Vipin Kumar, State Training Commissioner is providing special assistance.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify classified information
Andy Coulson, former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about their affairs while Charles Clark was Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Polby 's voice mail and "keep an eye on" the man, but Coulson called the court and left his voice mail, the report said.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not known to stand outside people 's homes and watch them, but rather to put articles in front of people, see how people react to them", said Mr. Addis.
He said NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face to face.
The third group included the editors themselves.
He obviously knew about the other method, which was surveillance.
What about the first one?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
They say, no, we say, "Yes, they absolutely knew".
The rumor about Clark's affairs was first introduced by A.O.T.W.'s feature desk when a source with a sexual interest in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
In August 2006, from Mulcare's home, at least three voice mail tapes were seized from Ms. Polby's phone.
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator 's computer that were labelled "Project" by Ms. Polby and her sister.
During the period of her investigation, Ms. Polby 's grandparents were called anonymously for information.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup watched Ms. Polby 's movements.
Through a voice mail to him on 18 June 2005, Coulson told him: "I've got a story we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about".
Mr Addis said that Colson's involvement in the case was in line with other key figures like former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Coulson had conversed with Mr Blunkett about romantic relationships with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied conspiring with others to hack the phone between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted to phone hacking.
The NSA 's revelations about state surveillance fueled corporate fear.
Late one quiet day in August, a German police helicopter crashed into the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
At the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked the BfV to hope to identify the presence of the listening antenna and hinted at an exchange operation between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, insisted that the U.S. not use its foreign intelligence capabilities "to steal trade secrets from foreign companies and to increase the international competitiveness or bottom line of U.S. companies".
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contractor turned whistleblower, began to reveal his treasured secrets to American surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director can keep his word.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful individuals can be targeted, surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use this data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey of German companies published in July by Consultancy, the US is now almost as much of a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, to date no evidence that the US used foreign companies' trade secrets for its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the EU's lack of internet capabilities and should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"There is no way", said Haso Platner, president of German business software company SAP.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, one should not have let it die 20 years ago.
In Germany, everything is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about American technological sophistication and spy access have proven to be a shock to some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China.
There is a big shift in the cloud computing space where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and therefore potentially sensitive.
A survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a trade organization, found that some 10 percent of non-US members cancelled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after revelations about a data prism mining program.
Jim Snape, co-CEO of SAP, says: "We saw a new question that customers didn't have a year ago: Where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore these must be guarded at all costs.
It is not surprising that economic espionage occurs.
It has always been.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do it because it 's in the national interest to protect our business .
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defense and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, it's been a long time since texting was recorded, whether it's a foolish thing to leave one at home at work with a USB stick, or a laptop unattended in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member of car manufacturer Audi, says it's a very old system of collecting cell phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive recommends considering using simple prepaid mobiles when smartphones are compromised due to risks on overseas trips.
Prepaid mobile phones were then thrown away later.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and surveillance is a concern.
In Germany, it is a number of companies that dominate the global market in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorised access", warns the BfV in a report.
The US has warned about economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
France named US National Intelligence in February as a second tier of criminals involved in hacking for economic intelligence, which trails China alongside Russia and Israel, according to The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, "the French are the worst when it comes to economic espionage".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, explains in an interview: "The services are well aware that all countries, even if they are not fighting terrorism, spy on their allies".
The Americans spy on us at the commercial and industrial level and we do it because it 's in the national interest to protect our business .
No one was fooled.
The parents of a teenager in Georgia who was killed in a "unique accident" believe their son was murdered.
A Georgia teenager whose body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, a family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Londes County Sheriff 's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in a "unique accident", but the 17-year-old boy 's family denied it.
"They strongly believe their son has been murdered", Benjamin Crump, the lawyer who represented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.
He doesn 't believe in death the way the sheriff described it.
Crump said that "they believe that this is beyond the laws of physics and common sense".
He feels that this finding is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for his son's death.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag".
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulroney said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he killed for a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead us.
My purpose is to bring the truth to the surface.
He said, "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation".
Moore told the reporter that initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional respiratory arrest".
According to Moore, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death".
He said that "there are many questions that need to be answered or confirmed".
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to subpoena a perpetrator or conduct a civil rights investigation into Johnson 's death, he would ask the FBI to do so.
A representative from the Long Beach County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment when contacted Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
CDC issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued guidelines to control food allergies in school children.
The U.S. government has issued guidelines for the first time as the number of school-aged children suffering from food allergies increases.
Now one in 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there has been an 18 percent increase in cases of food allergies in children.
The guidelines provide information to schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to handle them in case of allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to stockpile epinephrine to combat potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis - the most commonly used epiPen brand auto-injector.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, which allows schools to easily stock up on more epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something is biting into my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersex children can choose their child's gender indefinitely
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise a third gender for babies born with vaginal disorders.
Now newborn babies will not be assigned male or female in the traditional manner.
The new law does not require parents to declare gender for such children, allowing them to declare gender "undefined" or "undefined" on the child's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who may be rushing to make decisions related to gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I'm neither male nor female".
I will remain the scarred, stained garment made by the doctors.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children is born either boy or girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under the examination of sexual development disorders, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitals (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed sex.
It could be that Wallis Simpson was intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender determination cannot be done, it is best to use the best available information to specify gender and to monitor the child's psychological and physical development before surgery, if any, is performed.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in gender-identity issues, said that Germany's new law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children are causing moral confusion.
"Some people are in life-threatening situations that require surgery, but most children are not", he said.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child's sex will develop is not very precise.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's kind of a puzzle as to why people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not related to gender but to their biological makeup, which is neither clearly male nor clearly female but either a combination of both or neither is clearly defined.
These traits may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts and length; primary sex characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of employment discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons, as well as harassment, violence and biased offences.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult persons to mark themselves as male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognised "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to retain "non-identified" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of Home Affairs, the German passport will have a third specification in the form of X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial in neighboring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition to have "gender theory" removed from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, saying, "While the world is moving to a stage where gender is a choice itself, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in opposite directions".
A mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would like to see children assigned a gender at birth.
"Parenting without additional boundaries is very stressful, especially if you don't even know what the gender of your child is", he said on the parenting website.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites (bi-sexual), after the beautiful Greek goddess who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world had considered the penis a slate that could be erased and re-written.
But many people now are challenging the ethics of surgery, realizing that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes even a mistake by doctors, who don't know how children will feel about their gender specification when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Dresser says.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vaginal disorders was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed gender was unconstitutional.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to determine whether he or she is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had been accidentally removed during circumcision to have the child fully sterilized and his testicles removed and to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented the case as a successful case of metastasis, but it didn 't happen", said Drescher.
At the age of 15, the boy changed back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said some doctors are still "following the same pattern".
But with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s, individuals undergoing these gender surgeries began to come forward "not happy with the results".
A similar case was with 36-year-old Montana author Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome, but his genitals were unclear.
The doctors clearly did not understand that his penis was small, or that his foreskin was large, but they were sure that he could never live a "satisfying life" as a man.
So soon after his birth in 1976, Bruce 's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl".
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was about to have a vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and somewhat confused, he demanded medical records.
This revealed to him the terrible truth.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with DSD, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and had his breasts removed.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he works with an organization called Interface Project to help people normalize their perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamer-Matis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law "invites squabbling and stigma".
"Many activists feel that the German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and to designate the child as 'indefinite,' " she says.
We fear that this will encourage interference.
We think that rather than waiting, it is a better process to specify gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Matis said her organisation supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified as a third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender", he said.
The law of Germany is concerned with specifying it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
As they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Pittsburgh breast radiologist Dr. Erlene Baratz, whose daughter has a developmental disorder and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "empower" both parents and children.
Baratji's daughter Katie was born with male chromosomes, but she had a D.S.D. called Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.
Since her androgen receptor was defective, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to avoid making hasty decisions on their own", says Baracz.
It gives them time to understand and properly by some tests before writing 'male' or 'female'.
That way, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and enjoy it.
We do not need to rush into surgery that cannot be reversed.
"It brings children into the decision making process and frees parents from the anxiety that motivates them because they don't believe they are doing well", he said.
Eventually, the baby will determine which gender she is most comfortable with -- and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Legal Awareness Camp was conducted at Dalher Middle School, Ramnagar, by the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramnagar, chaired by Sandeep Kaur, Chairman of the Committee and the Chief Justice of Ramnagar.
The students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.
Advocates M. L. Gupta, Rohin Bhardwaj, and Sarpanch spoke on the subject and made the people aware.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Biden is considering dumping the Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama were secretly considering Hillary Clinton to replace Biden for the vice presidential ticket for 2012.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign Tom by Mark Halperin and John Hellman, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "broad group sessions and polls in late 2011" to find out what dumping Biden could help in Obama's declining reelection hopes.
According to Times national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the campaign efforts of the chief of staff and the former White House chief of staff to name the bill, to find out what effect the change of former Secretary of State Clinton from vice president had on the polls.
The potential switch was a top secret inside the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen knew the change was under consideration - including close presidential advisers Jim Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlade and David Paluffe.
Double Down claims that Dale tried to replace Biden despite his personal alignment before finally making a decision when his intelligence indicated that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Daley has confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I said in view of the whole scene, and one of them, this was", Dalle told the newspaper.
You remember when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in a position where we were like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dale described the research as "cautious", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign invested significantly in figuring out how much dividend the claim would pay if the poll was successful.
"Campaigns don't spend money like voting and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something", Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about the possible change.
While Dale said he "didn't think the president knew about the potential change", the former chief of staff admitted it was "possible" that Obama did.
"Double Down" sure: won't answer whether the political investigation reached Obama's desk?
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama Biden was unaware of the dumped ticket research.
"Probably", said Martin.
Do you like glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow - in - the - dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of marine animals to develop a great breakfast.
He got the idea after reading a paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to re-glow proteins.
Ice cream, the eater reacts with the tongue to increase the protein pH and the ice cream will glow.
Chris says that ice cream lights up in response to the heat in your mouth, which means the more you lick it, the more it lights up.
Charlie, founder of the company that makes the delicious ice cream, said: "It's incredible, but the first days of production, £200 would be about two grams of stuff".
The protein we use in ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is warm, the protein will raise the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it feels perfect to share on Halloween because it gives amazing glowing effects.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because jellyfish gloss is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me about 140 pounds.
However, the taste of iska is very good.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company, Apne is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next work is going to be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream".
This is naturally impossible because of the ice crystals that create refraction on top of the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is a useful fluorescent property of a jellyfish, which was synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market in Rani Bagh was full of customers.
Recently, people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy pottery.
This was the case in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Central Market at Prashant Vihar.
A similar sight was seen at the Sarafa shops of Pithampur, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
Here too, people bought gold and silver jewelry and coins in abundance.
This caused traffic jams in other markets including the Outer Ring Road.
However, people who left the office for home had to spend hours in traffic jams to get home.
Halloween 2013: by the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I'm more than a greedy person.
I haven't even signed up to give out candy from my apartment for the past two years and probably won't this year.
But the statistics show that I'm a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans will actually spend $158 million on Halloween this year, $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always noticed is the Halloween trends.
Out of the total expenditure of $6.9 billion, according to NRF, the cost of clothing is estimated at $1.2 billion.
This year sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women don't have to prostitute themselves because that's sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For men, I hope that a lot of zombies, and thanks to the walking dead, space will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched outfits will be zombies, Batman, robbers and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dogs and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet clothes.
That's the irony of a lot of hot dogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year.
The Hirschy bars, the Lollipops, the Milk Dads, the Twistlers and the Clark bars are worth around £600 million.
According to the US Department of Commerce, it's good news that 41 million trucks and trucks are going to be participating in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and whoever's kidding, are going to buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
According to the Confectioners Association, one thing we won't use during Halloween is candy corn, but that too will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's the personal mecca of about 9 billion.
It 's a mystery.
Nothing is more subtle than a Halloween haunted house.
They were best known as, "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a prison), "Scream-O-Scream" and were like "House of Shock".
According to the American authorities, there are actually 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million in revenue, and those awesome good photos that your friend posts on Facebook and the guy who likes and comments on your Nice Face.
Finally, let us talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've done since we were kids.
Luckily for us, there was the "Baby in a Pumpkin Trend" that started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not hanging out with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-o-the-slowly fading lantern on your front porch, probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for extra loans, call Tim and Susan Matisdon in Napa, Calif., and try their 2,032-pound pumpkin carving upstairs.
"It was decided to issue a postage stamp with Sachin's photo during the pre-match presentation", the MCA said in a statement.
This will be followed by a joint presentation by BCCI and MCA.
In addition, a special coin will be used for tossing which will be held by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64-page brochure, which will feature articles related to Tendulkar and statements about him by people from the business, sports and journalism worlds.
The limited number of brochures and coins will be distributed to the members of MCA and BCCI, the association said.
He said 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 hats with Sachin's photo will be distributed every day.
Land Rover Rally Series announced

Its options include - upgraded brakes, service package that provides access to Ball Works mechanics, logistics support, and vehicle collection between events.
"The rally customers who come to the bowler have changed", said Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsports.
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for a way to get to the thrill and excitement and world class events.
We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different rally modes in the UK and abroad, and prepares the competitor for the rigour and truth of the rally raid.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be a really fun championship.
In addition, Defender Challenger will offer the option to compete in training and test days in February as well as desert events in North Africa and Middle East.
The dream of the firecrackers to do business in the market in the transport area did not come true.
The firecrackers are stuck in Mazdar after the High Court order.
Neither can they operate in the temporary fireworks market on Ranjit Avenue nor have they been issued a license to operate in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs. 10 lakh for not having proper management there.
The High Court in its order has rebuked the administrative officials of Amritsar, saying that what is the point of an administration that for nine years could not solve even one difficulty of the firecrackers.
They could not be provided with adequate places in the city.
After this, the fireworks dealers were asked to issue licenses for trading in the market at Shipanagarh after having taken appropriate security measures.
The fireworks dealers were happy with the order, but the police turned the tide on Friday.
The team of the Asla Police License Branch reached the fireworks market and set up a counter there to sell the farms.
The conditions that were then laid before him were impossible to fulfil in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Anup Kumar in charge of Asla License Branch, SHO Sultanvind Arun Sharma arrived at the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the firecrackers.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to the firecrackers.
There is one day left to Diwali.
This has caused the fireworks merchants to be troubled.
They are seeing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecracker Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginny say that if they lose crores of rupees, they will sue the district administration.
Angry firecrackers marched from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They chanted slogans against the police and district administration.
After this, the temporary fireworks market on Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
A firefighter was called in to rescue a lost puppy on the dangerous mountain slope 50 feet above the ground in a mine.
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a minor road accident
He was found three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine.
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock with a rope to save the dog from dying.
After being somehow trapped by Puppy on the dangerous mountain slope 50 feet above the ground, the call of firefighters brought him to a fortunate life.
Nine month old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, Denholm, and have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he escaped after a minor accident, he searched frantically for his lost dog, and posted appeals on social networking sites.
At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, 50 feet above the ground, on the mountain in the mine.
A technical rescue team from Clackheaton Fire Station arrived at the scene and lowered Ruby by rope to save her and used a stomach tube to bring her down from the cliff.
Technical expert rescue officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a critical condition.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet above and below.
She did not move during the defense, she was a stone.
But now she's fine.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual cry for help.
It is incredible to see a dog.
Special technical rescue officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived fortunately".
He was likely to be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a vet for examination, where she was found to be well except for fatigue and dehydration.
"It was terrible to watch the rescue", said Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire.
At first I couldn 't believe how she got there.
It 's amazing to have her back in my hands.
The vet said that if she was too tired and fell, she would definitely fall.
The fire brigade did a very good job.
What they did was really very brave.
We are grateful to them, and they were all excellent.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley also said: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there".
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
Mick Jagger says that when Katy Perry was 18, he didn't hit her.
During an interview with the Australian Radio Show this week, the Pun star said that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and "when I was 18, he hit me".
He said, "This is getting old, and they're treating me well".
Jagger's representative, 70, said in a statement on Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry".
The representative also said: "Perhaps Perry, in the mistaken belief of another person, is talking about her".
Perry was one of the singers who guested on Rolling Stone's tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
George Caravan: The dismantling of the euro gave the Scots a choice
Another day, another story of freedom fear
This time we have been warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join as a free travel zone across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport controls on Berwick and barbed wire on Hadrian 's walls suggest stories about the limits of the barbed wire.
True, the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it was not described in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe how EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to suit their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, there will be a cheap rebate for persistent non-compliance in Brussels in exchange for getting what Brussels really wants from Scotland.
So, again, non - story.
The first time I heard the baseless news about "freedom means passport control" was about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why trade London's yoke for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: The great, post-war plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the EU, parties dedicated to opposing the EU or to ending the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany the Eurosceptical Alternative for Germany party - which was founded only this year - came up suddenly and won almost half a million votes in the September federal election, thus effectively ousting the Free Democrats (our own Lib Dems equivalent) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis has proved to be a transformative one.
With the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as the constraints imposed on national economies through compliance with the common currency, many are beginning to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play much of a role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the exchange rate of its members in favor of German exporters - something German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a situation with an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending - which is encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budget and currency problems lies a deep European productivity malaise.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - to provide a discount to French and German energy firms on consumer spending - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen at Grangemouth.
Even a worldwide wage freeze cannot prevent the European petrochemical industry from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
The result is a feeling of popular revolt, especially in France, once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, France 's top politicians saw the EU as a way to keep Germany in check, and to give Paris the same billing in the world as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing France's economy to stumble.
Result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU National Front has won the recent by - elections, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot go on assuming that a split for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound fame among French whites, working class?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti - EU, anti - monetary loyalist group in the European Parliament.
If, as is very likely, the anti - EU parties do well in these elections, this type of faction could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: the convergence of anti - EU and anti - universalist sentiment in Europe will soon destroy the euro.
The euro will not disappear completely, but it will break up and return to a form like "Europe of sovereign nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its successor economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of increasing its rapprochement with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to remain the Little England area (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to pull out at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non - confederate nations to work together in Europe with other like - minded countries.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence following the Norwegian path.
The SNP government in Scotland has - remarkably - been the most successful anti - austerity political campaign in Europe, winning a surprising majority in 2011 on the back of opposition to the proposed (and implemented) cuts by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory - Lib Dems coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, in which case it would have to accept the austerity rules imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: Growing up early
Research shows that African - American and Hispanic girls reach puberty at a younger age than white girls their age.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks may be a cause of premature puberty.
Premature puberty is not as effective in boys.
Former CNN correspondent Pat Ethridge is a journalist who specializes in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter starts to develop breasts and genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are common among American girls, reflecting a new trend.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - that it usually does not indicate rapid progress toward full puberty", says Kaplowitz.
Direct developmental signs such as breast germination, genital and eyebrow hair and body odor are seen in girls prematurely.
But in the last four decades there has been very little change in the age of the first menstrual period.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"It takes at least two to three years for the first menstrual period to begin when the breasts begin to develop", explains Kaplowitz, who is also the author of "Premature Puberty in Girls: An Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem".
The most accurate test of puberty development is time.
There is debate about what is the onset of puberty, but when it occurs with the growth of breasts before the age of 8 years two is called "child-adult".
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop - which the pediatrician can monitor closely.
In case of more rapid progression, examination by an endocrinologist may be required to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other outcomes: premature aging of the bones, which can lead to underdeveloped growth and a weakened adult height.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child 's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of the drugs but admits, "Suppressing adolescence can increase behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel different from their peers".
The second big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their young daughter to have a period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they're going to keep themselves clean", says Kaplowitz.
One woman, whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock.
Although there were signs of this and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She returned to her school frightened and upset that she had been the first of her friends to start menstruating.
There are many well - established theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence to suggest that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys - like girls - are also reaching premature puberty.
Kaplowitz establishes the rule that the most important cause is the outbreak of obesity.
She helped conduct a study in 2001 on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which linked body fat to puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzles: Although boys are acquiring facial and genital hair at a young age, the full puberty process is not as clear - cut as in girls.
Other physicians present at the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, acne and genital hair have become common.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty", says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeo Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean negotiating ahead of schedule", advises Kaplowitz.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond correctly.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be reassured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.
The temperature dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
The rain and cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wore sweaters and headed to markets and their destinations.
People have also taken their leave when the first rains of winter come.
In the morning, people were seen enjoying the sunshine.
The change in weather will also provide relief from cold and other illnesses, but after that the cloud cover continued to cover the day.
The children also came to their school wearing sweaters.
The maximum temperature was 25.1C and the minimum temperature was 13.7C on Thursday, according to the Air Force Meteorological Department.
While 7.8 mm of rainfall was recorded.
According to the Meteorological Department, the clouds will continue to cover the sky.
Large orders from jet manufacturers at stake from the controversy over seat width.
Setting the tone for the fight for this month's Dubai Airshow, a race has begun between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of passenger-class seats for long-haul flights.
The controversy centers on the width of the seat in economy class on long haul aircraft, not always as offered by airlines but whose allocated space efficiency is claimed by the latest Jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be key.
Airbus is hoping to meet industry standards for a minimum of 18 inches (46 cm) of wide seating in the economy cabin this week, but that should be decided by the airline, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers comes after the 17-21 incident led to a competition to sell larger versions of the twin - engine long - range aircraft from potential orders.
How the rear compartment of the aircraft is designed - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10 - the design of mini jumbo jets is being designed with the demands of greater capacity in mind.
Boeing says it has built a 777 X that will seat 406 people, 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the economic department.
Airbus says it will be able to carry 350 people in a nine - pared seat with an 18-inch clearance, competing with the A350.
Aircraft giants often strike a deal on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, with the Airbus 777X expected to dominate over 100 orders at the Dubai Airshow, it is further appealing to the public.
Recently, it has been seen that the beginning of the war of independence is something that shows Fincerro, the three of them together in a restaurant, will you accept it?
"Boeing is offering long haul flights in narrow seats, even from regional turbos", said John Leahy, Airbus head of sales.
As a change, people may get bigger, but the way they board planes hasn't changed.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo jet defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American male aged 40 to 49 gained 10 percent in weight.
According to the US Health Statistics, the average American man in the 21st century has a waistline of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950s one-seat concept when the new name "jet set" was narrow in average circumference.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an extra inch in seat width improves sleep quality by 53 per cent.
Boeing disputed Airbus' seat size figures, saying it was not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airline would balance fare and amenities.
It also says, that research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin.
"It really shows airlines the flexibility they need to offer and the things they believe they need to do to succeed", said Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver.
"They don 't want to tell us what they 're getting out of it".
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers, it's about elbow room, but for suppliers, it's increasingly an issue that can affect revenue.
The trade behind this dispute is estimated to be at least $700 billion, enough for the competition for aircraft orders to tip the scales of US and European exports in the coming decades.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, whether seat layout is really a battle issue among new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 per cent efficiency per seat in their new twin engine design compared to the segment leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing 's claim to performance depends on the 10 x 1 777 compared to the original 9 x 777 design.
The comparison with the gain in unit cost is now used.
Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus' passenger facilities in Europe says "Boeing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat per - row cabin for the existing 777 S suggests that many passengers favor the dancer layout, which can also go with the cheap fare.
"Eighteen inch seat widths would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business proposition from Airbus is driven by the threat of the 777", said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Jet sellers around the world should also take careful measures to check on this layout competition.
While more relaxed, all the builders are also offering low cost airline and regional jet aircraft high density layouts.
Airbus is offering a 10 equivalent A350 but says it hasn 't been sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus emphasized wider cabin seats on some of its jets to require more cabin space.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without other manufacturer support, but this could distract from the 777 X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
More testing is needed before human trials can begin, which could take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the intrinsic signs are positive.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is far more powerful than these current methods", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus designed to transmit genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood and prevent nicotine from being released into the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the vaccinated rats that were later given nicotine continued their normal activities.
But the rats that were not given the vaccine "felt good", the researchers say, a sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
The experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The first tobacco vaccines failed because they had antibodies.
It required dosing at regular intervals to maintain antibody levels, but proved expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine is expected to be expensive, as it will turn liver cells into an antibody factory.
Professor Kristal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, thus protecting them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smokers to help them quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they will not get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help to break their habit", he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned that much more research was needed.
Even after the post - mortem, the real cause of death of the tiger could not be revealed.
The Forest Department has responded in a blunt manner, at first glance, calling the death of the tiger a natural one.
On Thursday night, forest workers from Ramnagar Forest Division found a tiger's body near the Khichdi drainage of Pavlagarh Conservation Reserve.
The tiger was completely intact and had no signs of wounds or injuries.
On Friday, the postmortem of the tiger was carried out by Bharat, a veterinarian from CTR and Hema Rathore, a veterinarian from Kotabag in the presence of Forest Conservator Vivek Pandey, Saket Badola, Deputy Director of CTR, DFO Kahkasha Naseem, SDO GS Karki.
Sources say that the tiger's internal body was reported to have decayed during the postmortem.
This did not reveal the actual cause of death of the tiger.
The departmental officials were bluntly replying to the death of the tiger.
However, the tiger's internal organs have been sent to IVRI Bareilly for topical psychological examination to confirm poison.
Western Circle conservationist Vivek Pandey said the death of the tiger was natural.
No signs of poisoning etc. were found on the tiger' s body.
Nevertheless, the area surrounding it is being searched and the BISRA is sending a probe to confirm the poison.
Tripody denies being influenced by Obadiah.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by State Corruption Watchdogs.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe Tripody has refused to dispute the policy of leases on the sea at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, former New South Wales patron Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed the investigation into whether Mr Obaid lobbied several state ministers for lease policy circulars for breaches where two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid were renewed without tender after their expiry in August 2005.
The allegation that Mr. Tripody knew of Mr. Obaid 's hidden interests is now being investigated following testimony given on Thursday by Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff.
During years of discussions in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders to be launched for the leases.
The lease owners were against it and they wanted more time.
In 2009, the leases of Circular Enterprises, which earned Obaid $2.5 million a year, were renewed without tendering the leases.
Mr. Tripodhi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change Mr. Obaid 's request , Mr. Tripody had urged a change in the government lease policy .
Transcript presented in a phone call between Mr. Obaid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obaid's Fisheries Department after working at the Ministry of Ports in ICAC in August and September 2007.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. "What was being discussed in the telephone conversation, the development of commercial lease policy?"
"No", answered Mr. Tripody.
I can 't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn 't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Officials say Israeli warplanes have raided Syria.
Israeli warplanes targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the motive was, but there must have been at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has carried out airstrikes on missiles inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visa can pass "authenticity" test
A "validity" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as it aims to expand a strict procedure.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457 being used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to be disguised as being passed on to family and friends.
An official discussion paper was released today, condemning the government's rhetoric about foreign workers, with former Labour MP Maxine McQuaid today saying it could anger Australia's neighbours.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and the strong rhetoric about "Australians jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions are demanding a safe labour market.
Historically, it meant that white workers should be protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some in the region saw an echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion letter outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday where he met with officials about trafficking, has implemented five proposed changes while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant can be checked to see "whether the nomination is true in circumstances where the nominated person, the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or the corresponding person is a relative or personal partner".
Businesses may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a smaller number of employees hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine - year - old son had come with him on a voyage to Australia, and after his father died on Wednesday, he has been beheaded by an adult cousin who was on the same vessel.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study to increase Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project has been announced by the British Government.
Works by HS2 point to high speed services in Scotland and the north of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "make Britain one".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "very excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building a high speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was in negotiations with Transport Scotland, directed HS2 Limited to consider possibilities for further improving rail capacity and travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the potential to reduce the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is a genuine national network, bringing the UK and its cities closer together".
We are moving forward with HS2 because its benefits will be enormous.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity of 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected because of HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
"High speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the whole matter of high speed rail across the UK", said Mr Brown.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British Government to explore options to bring high speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and complete the Glasgow - Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British Government Ministers next year and deciding together on further action.
Aircraft Electrical Equipment Regulations will remain in force in Australia
Despite the softening of equipment regulations in the US, Australian airline passengers will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during takeoff and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left open the option for US airline operators to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided that they are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this during many flights now, but many people do not like being unable to access their e - books etc. during takeoff and landing.
Australian airlines are considering the decision, which would require much more work from US airlines to meet this requirement, but have indicated that they have no immediate plans to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical stages of flight are still in effect in Australia.
"Currently, CASA has no specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment on board", the authority said, "This issue falls under the regulations, according to which airline operating companies have to ensure that safety arrangements are always in place and that passengers comply with safety instructions given by crew members".
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is ready to follow this change, but it asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We would welcome a review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical devices, as we really feel that this will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft", the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules for now.
It said that "According to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during takeoff and landing and we have no immediate plans to change this".
FAA decisions apply to US airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The effect of this decision will vary for each US airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their rulebooks, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and passenger briefing.
"After airlines verify the tolerability of their aircraft, they will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes", the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during landing.
The group also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the upper compartments during takeoff and landing.
The silver of pawnbrokers as it is felt difficult by the middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirtalinga is taking cash from her gold earrings, rings and earrings in a pawnshop at the Bendemeyer Shopping Centre in Singapore to pay for her daughter 's school fees.
"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is in it", said Mrs. Amirtha Linga.
She says that although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (US$2,400) as an administrator and her husband also works, the family's monthly income is insufficient.
In fact, with similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic lending is on the rise - ValueMax, where they are doing their business, became the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry pawns are not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore dollars in Ms. Amarthalinga's case - but almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
In general, pawnbrokers in Singapore charge 17 percent per year, which is just slightly higher than the 15.4 percent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary and can provide loans more quickly than banks.
Millions of people in the region are turning to pawn shops as families face difficulties due to rising living expenses and increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to easy monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle income families are turning to pawnshops to meet their needs as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency, Standards and Powers, identified rising domestic earnings, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt to GDP ratio in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from a tech slump this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued export slump and declining consumer demand.
"The crucial point is that with rising prices, people from the middle to lower classes [of the income scale] will try to increase their income in every way possible", said economist Song Seng Won at the Bank of Malaysia, CIMB.
Historically high prices in gold over the last two years have prompted people to mortgage personal assets as they seize the opportunity to redeem their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items pledged in 200 pawn shops in the city - state are gold.
People are saying, "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month.
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EGMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
The pawnshop business is so booming that ValueMax, the outlet operator in Bendemir, and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, Malaysia where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Ya Li Ching.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it received in its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that not only does mortgaging get a cheaper rate than other lenders, but it does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers mortgage what they already own, and paying off personal assets does not increase household debt", she says.
The social acceptance of pawnbroking for securing short term financial support is increasing.
It is not that pawnbrokers are used only by the financially weak.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, they mortgage gold bars or Rolex watches which can get cash payment of up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have clients from all sections of society.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs", Ms. Yah says.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.

A $325 million rescue package for the health of Taji
The Union Government has stressed that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system also includes strict conditions that will ensure that the state government cannot waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibursek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis due to the island state's ageing population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The decision to fund the project over four years was taken after consultation with the Government with Andrew Wilkey, Independent MP for Tasmania.
"The Government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we are confident will address the particular challenges facing the state", Ms. Plibursek said today.
The $325 million package also includes an optional surgery plan worth $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help to resolve the previous accumulated cases.
This includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices that have been shown to me by leading practitioners to improve Tasmania's health system", Ms Plibursek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian Government will face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State must maintain the current level of funding to receive Commonwealth funds and report each month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three member commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is provided by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said $325 million would not mean much unless "real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level".
Nevertheless, he praised the Government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister's attention in early May".
"I hope that the federal assistance package will be very helpful in removing the state public health system from the crisis list", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will largely undo recent cuts.
But Peter Dutton, the federal opposition health spokesman, believes today's announcement is a "band-aid solution".
He told ABC TV, "We are here because the Labor State government has taken $430 million out of its healthcare system.
You cannot consider the fact that the State Government has taken almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth has given 300 million dollars as a day of good news.
Mr Dutton demanded that Ms Plibarešek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on extra bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Denis Diderot 's novel by Guillaume Nicloux has excellent production design and time period detail, but it goes far beyond what it should have.
Set in 1760s France, the novel tells the tragic story of a young noblewoman named Suzanne who is sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the self - willed and abusive Mother Superior, and becomes the object of erotic attraction for the other.
This film never gets into the sexiness or the thrill - and that is the problem.
The seriousness of the narrative also risks making it a boring film for the audience.
CSA Vice Chancellor Dr. Munna Singh has decided to charge an entrance fee to the garden due to the dirt spreading in the garden.
The department has given an ultimatum of 15 days to rectify the situation.
The Vice Chancellor conducted a thorough inspection of the Sub Director Seeds and Fields and Director Research with the Horticulture Department at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees, including the director, in these departments, being thrown from their seats.
After the scolding, he threatened to cut the salary the next time he was found absent.
Dr. Naushad Khan, the university's media officer, said that a Rs 30 pass would be required for a month of walking.
For a fee of one rupee per day, people will be able to walk in the garden.
Systematically: The incoming files related to various tasks will be brought before the Vice Chancellor under one system.
Not every employee will have the right to enter the Vice - Chancellor 's office with his file.
The final report will be conveyed to the Vice Chancellor by the concerned officials.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons.
Syria has destroyed critical equipment to make chemical weapons and poison gas war material, the monitoring group said on Thursday, while fierce fighting has emerged in northern Syria, very close to where toxic agents are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war, which began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons comes a day before the deadline of November 1.
The Hague - based organisation had ordered Damascus to destroy or "disable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix chemical gases and fill in war material.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, in particular, is a significant milestone in this ambitious development, which aims to destroy all Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and collections it has.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemical and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting escalated Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as a storage centre, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports.
The Movement Group, which tracks the death toll in Syria through the Movement's network, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
It has said that 61,067 civilians including 6,365 children are among the dead.
The government said 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that the dead included 2,202 army deserters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country due to this conflict.
Assad's military force fought rebels in Safiira for weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al Qaeda groups.
On Thursday the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything explicit.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria in a very short time frame, during the ongoing civil war.
The statement from the OPCW, which works with the UN, said its team was "satisfied and confirmed that all declared critical production and blending/filling equipment from Syria has been destroyed".
It also said, "No further inspection activities are planned".
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first phase of verification work at 21 out of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit the two centres due to security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that, according to Syria, the two sites "have been abandoned and... chemical weapons products stored there were moved to other declared sites, which have been inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Saffira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were unable to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the determination and courage you have shown in completing the most challenging mission undertaken by this organisation to date", said Ahmet Uzumcu, Director General of the Monitoring Group, in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
The three-year civil war is mainly between the Assad government and its security forces, which include members of the Ahwazi sect, which has split from Shia Islam, and rebellious Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said a massive explosion occurred at an air defense centre in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion is not yet known.
Police have recovered from the accused fake registry, fake stamps, laptop and photocopies of fake registry.
Moti Nagar Police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the arrested accused include Rajiv Agarwal aka Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghomar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghomar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of Registrar 's Office (Eastern) has fled the scene.
According to the police, the accused along with the Registrar's office clerk and record keeper Balbir Singh, would take out papers from the records of empty and old land and then buy new stamp paper and prepare a fake registry on them.
Not only that, but the real registry was then removed and replaced with a fake registry record.
The accused then sold the land for crores of rupees on forged paper.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was pushed by the police and the administration.
The accused who had prepared the fake registry had a special eye on the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
So it is easy to create and sell fake land registries.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused had told in questioning that they had prepared about 150 fake registries till now.
According to the police, the gang 's chief Rajiv has previously been charged with fraud and theft.
Anger over the punishment of the Bali bomb plotter
Relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bombings expressed outrage at the punishment of the bomber and said that Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who was on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in manufacturing the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released in 15 years if he is granted parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of a mass murder attack at two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured dozens more.
He was also convicted of many other terrorism - related charges, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have also demanded the death penalty for the so-called "destructive man", notorious as the master bomb maker.
The decision brought back painful memories of June Courtine, a Perth woman who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co - conspirators a decade ago.
Withholding his tears, he said that Patek should have been executed.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other terrible terrorists.
"He should be brought before the firing squad", Ms. Courtine told AAP.
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
The club was destroyed shortly after 11 pm on 12 October 2002 after a bomb exploded in a van parked outside The Sari Club.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a backpack full of explosives was detonated by suicide bombers just 20 seconds before the bombing.
He went into a month - long coma as a result of the bombing and "died" three times while on life - preserving equipment.
Mr Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amarozi, Mukhallas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be put to death before anyone else.
There's no reason to keep him alive, see, no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bombings.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally captured in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, FBI agents presented evidence that reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bill Laden in an effort to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He did not surrender", says Ms. Courtine.
Even today, he doesn't really feel the pain of causing so much mental pain to so many people.
The decision comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year", said Ms. Courtine.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on board (but not cell phone calls)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music - but not to speak to their cell phones - from entering the gate to disembarking from the gate, under highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But travellers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a press conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said how quickly these changes are implemented will vary with each airline.
Airlines will have to demonstrate to the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and how they are updating their crew member training manuals and rules for collecting devices to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we may very soon approve the expanded use of electronic devices", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the gate is closed.
They are expected to not operate the aircraft until it reaches an altitude of 10,000 ft and is cleared by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when landing and not turn them on until the aircraft has fully landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic interference can allow their passengers to use the device during boarding, take-off and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airlines and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these standards.
The president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, Laura Glading, has welcomed the changes.
"When the policy is implemented safely - and we will work with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides", Glading said in a statement.
We are tired of feeling like "hall monitors" when it comes to this issue.
But surfing the internet, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So you still won't be able to talk to friends, a game like online Scrabble, which is related to the famous incident in 2011 when actor Alec Baldwin, while playing on his smartphone while parked at the gate, was taken off the plane by American Airlines when he was told not to turn off the device.
Heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their bouncing will cause concern of injury to another person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will continue to be prohibited during the flight.
The Federal Communications Commission has regulatory authority over telephone calls, not the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is a national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not only because they can potentially cause interference in navigation - related devices, but also because they can cause interference in cell phone towers when in the air", said Rosenkreuz.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue last month recommended that the government should allow more use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure has been mounting on the FAA in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D - Mo. have said there is no legitimate safety reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult to enforce as the device is used more and more.
Some studies also indicate that almost a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment due to passengers carrying FM radios and high technology gadgets of the time.
New airlines, more reliant on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, are also designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi at cruising altitude to passengers for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
Huerta said most airlines should meet eligibility criteria for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit radio transmissions of much lower power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e - readers have a very nominal transmission when the page is turned.
But transmission is stronger when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has been among those who have advocated easing restrictions on passengers using the device.
In 2011, the company 's officials loaded their entire Kindle e - reader into the airline and flew it to test for problems but found no such problems.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks of using the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believed the interference from the device was real, even if the risk was nominal.
Other members of the committee said there are only reports described by the pilot in support of interference by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the committee members recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device when landing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them a common sense convenience for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
U.S. Travel Association CEO Roger Doe said, "We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that traveling with joy is not inconsistent with rescue and safety.
Taking a lesson from the series of bombings in Patna, the UT Police has taken steps to ensure quick reaction in the Diwali celebrations and during emergencies in the context of security.
A total of 1800 soldiers will patrol with vehicles and on foot at all major sites, crowded markets and other places of the city to ensure smooth running of traffic, prevention of flash mob attacks, teaching the minds a lesson and other activities to apprehend the perpetrators.
These personnel will include women police personnel including PCR, Traffic Unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also be on duty vigilantly checking records at hotels, guest houses and other places including PGs in the city.
The SHO has been directed to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
The DSP has been entrusted with the task of inspecting the markets, malls and other places including VIP sectors of the city.
In view of the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the higher authorities have also assigned additional police personnel to duty at the Police Control in view of the convenience of the people.
The Police has asked the staff of the Fire Department and other dispensaries, including the Director, Principal Director and DHS of PGI, besides the management of Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMCH to maintain high alert in emergency times.
To teach the minds a lesson, departmental officials have now put others on duty, including women police personnel, under the NGO leadership as 'Anti Gangsta Staff'.
The police of the Anti Gangsta Staff Team will be on standby in crowded places including markets in plain clothes to apprehend the gangsters.
All SHOs have been ordered to install 44 naaks in the inner areas of the city on Diwali.
Police personnel will also be on standby at 38 Naka Points along the city boundaries.
The bird was released back into the wild by airlift to protect it from the North Sea Ridge.
The bird found stranded on the North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild from the coast by air transport.
The water rail was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before being brought back to health at their rescue centre in Aloha by the Scottish SPCA.
"This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, exposed to strong winds over the North Sea", explained center manager Colin Seddon.
It seems that the bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
"It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help", he added.
The water rail was healthy and fit before it was released.
Is the European upper class ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April and pledged to bring business together and determine what changes the UK's jobs and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they thought of UK business with the EU.
U-Gov asked for ideas from 1000 business leaders representing UK business size, sectors and locations.
The findings of this survey may surprise many.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU member states are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritize new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than getting caught up in the long and painful process of reforming the EU 's secretive institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these crucial competences should revert to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market was easily seen, with businessmen saying that the cost of Brussels regulation far outweighs the benefits of remaining part of Europe's trading zone - even 40 percent of the giants who have traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large proportion clearly want Britain to move towards trade -based relations and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
The finding, seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen were pushing for a "meaningful change" that would restore the UK to its lost strength.
The price is high - the issue of treaty change and a better deal for Britain changed the poll, with 16 percent voting to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that British businessmen support his plan to negotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate the current balance of power in favour of the UK, making a meaningful shift.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and is fast becoming imperative as the eurozone moves towards a peripheral economy and fiscal union.
The priority must of course be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show that for businessmen this means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in the way Brussels regulates.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new era
The head of Gazprom said the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the beginning of Europe's largest energy projects.
"Today marks a historic event: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe", Gazprom President Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A dispute over a contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas to Europe is delivered, presents a risk to traditional routes, officials said.
A direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" gone, Miller said.
After the completion of the project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA staffers accused of sexual offences before the charges against Jonathan Lord were heard by the Royal Commission
Before the charges were brought against Caringbah childcare worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sexual offences.
But in its statement before the Commission it said that it had "never come across a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the Commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case in which a YMCA Caringbah gym instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare, from the Advocate Gale Furness, who assisted the Commission, said he was aware of the first case but was unaware of the second.
He also admitted that the statement made by the YMCA before the Commission that "the YMCA has been externally investigated and found to be at the forefront of child protection" was also not accurate.
The Commission has evidence that the YMCA was notified and received the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who has been associated with the YMCA since the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed "including myself" by appointing the Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their responsibilities in reporting violations of child protection policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 children during his two-year tenure at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years' imprisonment.
But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem at the YMCA which caused staff not to report child protection violations by the Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw about the violations, including the Lord spending time alone with the children, babysitting them privately, putting them on his lap, telling them he loved them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord's supervision and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that YMCA Caringbah Child Services Manager Jackie Burnatt, who was Lord's supervisor, was "very bullying and difficult to get along with most of the time".
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from employees that they were not comfortable reporting above their manager.
He said that rather his friendship with the Lord misled his decision to inform about him.
Mr Hare said he had given his view to the YMCA NSW congregation that the lesson for the organisation from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not giving information".
Mr Hare said the decision to have the employees sign the confidentiality agreement was taken by Liam Whiteley, General Manager of Child Services at the YMCA, immediately after the allegations came to light.
He said it was intended to avoid the confusion of evidence, but it was "overhyped" and not executed properly.
Stephen Smallbone, a child sexual abuse specialist at Griffith University, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation when Jonathan Lord was in charge between 2099 and 2011.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruitment, probation, admission, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned to December 20.
Blair says they want to return to Britain
Tony Blair said he would like a chance to be Prime Minister of the UK again - but he believes there is no chance of a return.
In an interview on the night of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After leaving office in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his commentary to his role as foreign affairs and Middle East group peace maker representative.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister's office, Mr Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard newspaper as saying: "Yes, sure, but that's unlikely, so"...
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.
When the crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even in school and months away from taking her first step, this toddler and her pet Shetland Pony Taffy completed three stages with great ease and won the top prize - beating out 30 of her adult competitors.
At the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Ruddery, near Cardiff, the inseparable pair - who are Sk - was highly praised for their looks, manners and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, he tilted his flat hat at a slight angle and led his two - year - old Toffee around the ring.
Fenton was praised by decision makers for his natural ability to control, which was well ahead of his age.
Toffee received the highest marks for his looks and personality.
Fenton was given the Toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and has been training with the Shetland pony every day since.
"Fenton and Toffee are a great couple", said his 30-year - old mother, Donna.
They were challenged by all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most unusual in this theater, he was so amazing to everyone that they wanted to take a photo with him.
This little boy from the village of Nantyglow near Ab Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
"The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was cheering and clapping", said Mrs Howells.
He was running across the arena on sand, and despite his small appearance, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is an animal lover - he loves horses, tractors and farming, and has two chickens that he cares for.
The way he's started, he'll be in the best horse show of the year long before - and I'm sure he'll do very well.
"Fenton is only three years old, but he has mastered the control of his pony", said a spokesman for the annual horse show.
They are a very good couple.
The judges gave points based on the performance of Fenton and Toffey and their presentation in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between the pony and his rider - Fenton and Toffey were the best in the ring in this case.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped her, he really looked very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be "revived"
A Chinese newspaper that had a front-page appeal to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be reinstated, a press regulator said.
Guangzhou's New Express newspaper made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But afterwards Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write a fabricated story about the state - owned company.
The regulator said that New Express now has to undergo a "complete overhaul".
The order for the "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of the Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a number of false reports about the listed company Jumloyan in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "The editorial management of the New Express was disorganized".
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking Chen Yongzhou's reporter's license".
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a thorough reform of the New Express, recommended investigating those responsible at the New Express and immediately revising the leadership of the New Express".
Mr. Chen had written many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities at a construction - equipment company called Jumloyan.
After he was suspended, his newspaper published a two - page appeal for his release, saying it supported Mr. Chen 's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen appeared on state television, admitting to writing and publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomloyan as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people 's trust", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have come to realize my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
Recently, many high - profile suspects have confessed to the TV broadcast.
Experts say that forced confessions are occasionally made, despite a law passed later this year that forbade authorities to force a person to confess to the crime himself.

The U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railroad
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been discovered, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot by three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the curved length of six football pitches, connecting the nearby warehouse in Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded with drugs.
Officials said the tunnel was closed before any drugs passed through.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel exploration.
Three individuals, who officials said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, they could face a sentence of 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of the vast underground drains.
The tunnel is the eighth major route to be explored in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after Central Mexico's marijuana harvest in October, posing a challenge to drug mafia groups capable of how to get the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, officials found a roughly 700-yard route equipped with rail tracks, stretching from a home kitchen in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
Congress candidate Sarhul Ram Bhagat has filed for the assembly constituency.
Apart from BJP and Congress, a total of 7 candidates including one and two independents from the National People's Party filed nominations on Thursday.
On Thursday, the seventh day of filing of nominations for the second phase of voting on November 19 after the notification of the Election Commission, which began on October 25, BJP candidate for Assembly Constituency 12-Jashpur Rajsharan Bhagat submitted the nomination letter with his promoter Naresh Nande to the returning officer.
At the same time, Sarhul Ram Bhagat, candidate of the Indian National Congress, filed nominations with his founder Ajay Kumar before the returning officer.
The BJP candidate for the Constituency 13- Kunkuri submitted the nomination letter along with his nominee Mohnram and the independent candidate for Kunkuri Assembly, Dr. Phulchand Kujur along with his ten nominees, Mrs. Apolina Khalkho, Ruben Kerketta, Sukh Sayeed Nag, Hemant Kujur, Shani Ram Bhagat, Walter Kujur, Vikas Kumar Jindal, Shri Gupta, Murali Lal Agarwal and Mrs. Sushila Kujur.
BJP candidate for Assembly constituency 14-Pathalgaon, Shiv Shankar Pankra, submitted the first nomination with his founder Tulsi Ram Kaushik and the second nomination with founder Rajendra Agarwal.

British police have issued an extradition notice to Assange.
British police today issued an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, adding that he would be solely responsible for his arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden over sexual offences, and his options under British law have expired since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he applied for political asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at the police station on a date and time chosen by us".
He is in violation of his bail terms.
The embassy declined to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges for releasing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the anti-privacy website WikiLeaks.
A fine of £1,000 for driving at 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs
The driver has been fined £1,000 for driving at 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes-Benz on the A120 in Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found take-away drinks at his feet.
In Colchester Magistrates Court, Howie has pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving.
Seven points were added to his licence, resulting in him being banned from driving for six months.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign property owners would end London's artificial status.
The Finance Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measures but is awaiting a final decision from Mr Osborne, who introduced a stamp duty at a rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget for houses worth over £2 million, and for individuals who prefer to own a house in a company rather than a separate person.
Stamp duty on residential properties in the Cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea in the tax year 2012/13 was £708 million, which is already more than the combined value of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and the North East, North West and Yorkshire and the Humber.
"After the increase in stamp duty on high value houses and the introduction of the associated anti - evasion legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a lower than reasonable tax on high value property, which has nothing to do with the impact of the outdated council tax system", Mr Cook explained.
He added that "but this move may make some foreign investors silent about buying property in London and reluctant to sell to current owners".
Prime property, the top 5 to 10 per cent of the housing market by value in affluent south-west London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, grew by a record 11.8 per cent last year.
According to Savils' research, central London prices continued to rise regularly at 5.6 per cent each year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the rising "domestic market", as the city saw booms in the southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent).
Scientists have shed more light on the relationship between the tail movements of a dog and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tail more to the right (from a dog 's point of view), while restless dogs wag their tail mainly more to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize and respond to this subtle difference in tail.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
"It is well known in humans that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions", explains neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellatertigra of the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see this in other species as well.
He explained that in dogs, as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and reverse order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral moaning by other dogs, researchers watched animals watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeat of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take us long to understand why their tail moves sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
"We presented dogs with dog films - in realistic versions or in photographs to deal with other confusing issues, and we could see the tail movement and render the tail more left or right", explained Professor Vellatertigra.
When the animals saw an emotionless dog wagging its tail to the right (as seen by the dog), they were completely at ease.
But when they saw the tail turn to the left (again from the dog 's point of view) their heart rate increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellatertigra, he does not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these gestures.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned from experience which actions they should be concerned about and which not.
He said: "If you have met other dogs several times, and if they constantly wag their tails to one side, it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience".
The researchers say these findings may provide better insight into the emotions of animals to owners, veterinarians and trainers.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, a dog behaviour expert, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: "Unlike the Italian study - when the tail of the robot dog was wagged to the left rather than the right, the dogs were more likely to approach it rather than be restless".
He said this difference was because dogs in various studies were not fully understood as dogs in the animals or robot dogs in the movies.
He explained that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there is ample evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is yet to be obtained - and dogs are no exception in this case", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us long to understand why their dams move sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow gig because of Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer suffered from laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro venue in the city on Friday.
But the illness of their lead singer Alex Turner forced them to reschedule the show.
The band's announcement came as they were obliged to postpone the gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday in the same manner.
In a statement on their official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the show at Birmingham LG Arena tonight after medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also have to postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st.
"The examination found Alex Turner to have an aneurysm, and he is unfortunately unable to perform".
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show at Glasgow Hydro on November 21.
All tickets will be valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience to all ticket holders.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, rank only below the pope, and they choose the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals in total.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the election of the pope - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony to promote the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals, called the papal assembly, would be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to hold the February papal council, to facilitate planning for other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said that the Pope generally announces the names of cardinals who are less than 120 in the number of cardinal electors, as well as those who are over 80 years of age at his discretion.
Valero said the next year's papal conclave will be important as it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year.
There is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially towards Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance", he said.
Forty percent of South America's Roman Catholics are cardinals, but their numbers are very small.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis created the Council of Cardinals - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to explore ways to reform the Church.
Before that the Pope decided everything himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him", said Valero.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we are not the first to be in this situation - it is completely new.
Valero said that normally the pope gives the title of cardinal to bishops of large places, but Francis was "completely surprising - so we don't know whose name he will announce".
GM recalled pickup trucks in the U.S. to fix the seatback
General Motors Co. has recalled nearly 19,000 trucks to correct a shortage of hand-turning seatbacks in its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks, according to a notice from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday.
Some trucks may have a lack of front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union Auto failed to comply with safety standards regarding seatback, head restraint.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint will not protect the driver properly, increasing the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks began shipping in June and, after a 2009 bankruptcy renewal, this marks the most significant vehicle launch for the top US automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
The owner could not review the notification letter due to the NSTMA 16-day government shutdown which had hampered the growth of auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 per cent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42, 660 Silverado and 16, 503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares were up 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
The Obama voters scream in frustration
I voted for Obama twice, expecting change.
He says Obama 's great efforts have been hampered by the GOP 's policy of obstruction.
The policy of blocking the Obamacare website can't be used as an excuse for drone attacks.
Obama's 2008 campaign memoir is a reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I feel will encourage me during my second year of medical school and inspire a ray of hope in me.
It's called "The Courage to Win", and it's a memorial to Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get up at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speech could hold your breath.
The election proved one - sided, and the newscasters paused to reflect the historical significance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.
A group of young visionaries were heading to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an 82% approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh truth, like returning from the world of dreams.
Those days of hope are hard to remember - they seem like a distant memory, a sad memory of missed opportunities.
After I voted for the first time, things really changed.
To put it simply, I could not have imagined any of this.
I credit Obama with many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "don't ask, don't tell" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of biased protest has blocked many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for health care, closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times I have defended myself to my colleagues and colleagues in the Obama administration, I have run out of answers to give them.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens, nor can it respond to the prosecution of people who expose government misconduct.
It cannot explain the murder of Anwar El Awlaki, an American citizen, without a trial, nor the decline in public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the report's findings, which say that the White House's efforts to silence the media have been "the most aggressive since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, this, three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, still doesn't excuse failure to design a simple website.
I don 't know if I expected this.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government could negate the political campaign that brought it about.
It is clear that elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public debate.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to be mostly self - chosen by the administration.
This is what bothers you most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative that did not seem to define his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we've long heard about.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is below 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return to 2008 through that book.
Seeing her reminds me of her missing promises.
I was reading a section of the book this week that described how Clinton suffered a huge loss because of Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post - mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
He said, "I want my socks back".
We must remember who we are.
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I could not agree more with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that PM Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the paternal leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the paternity leave scheme because his daughters can get pregnant and take advantage of it.
The mining industry's Maharathi, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer's United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be important in deciding whether to cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott 's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
"There could be a significant conflict of interest in the case of paid parental leave, because if any of their daughters become pregnant, they would have a direct interest in whether they get leave or not", said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of Fairfax 's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after he fell again.
Mr. Palmer called for a recount to speed up the process.
Tony Aute's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we voted?
He said, "We should have a better system".
Why can't we have a system where we fill out our forms on the computer, vote instantly and at 6:30 pm we have the results.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because if someone doesn 't like them, they can delete them?
In today 's world, using a pencil seems absurd.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting and recently issued a joint circular with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new job "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
"We want no other award than the award of history for serving the community at this crucial time", he said.
This caused the disputants to suffer.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his deep indignation over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said the rapidly increasing attacks on advocates and their families proves that the perpetrators have become fearless.
They have no fear of the police and the administrative system.
Referring to recent incidents of this kind in different places, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily guessed.
RBS suspended two Forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Exchange Department, two people familiar with the matter said, another indication that the global probe into suspected currency market manipulation by regulators is moving at a fast pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation into the world's largest financial market, which trades $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended as the investigation into what appears to be a recurrence of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal progresses.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank had received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators".
Last month, experts in the case said that RBS had sent records of emails and instant messages sent and received from the former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been relieved of his current position as European head of Forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at City, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts in the case said that Mr Usher 's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it took action against some of its employees this week after it was informed by Swiss regulator FINMA that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, FINMA, Switzerland's competition authority Vico, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations that bankers were misled to manipulate the currency market to their advantage.
People familiar with the matter said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks are scrutinizing instant messages and emails for years to find clues to wrongdoing.
The news of the probe has caused a stir among traders in a sector that has been among the top earners in the investment banks trading unit for the past several years but is facing a challenge this year as low currency volatility has reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it would be sacking the trader from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London this week, who had lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has promptly notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said: "We believe the trader acted alone and was controlled".
Students studying other courses including technical and management courses running on campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice Chancellor has written to the Governor for permission to hold the election.
With the commencement of the admission process to the university, the demand for the student union elections began to rise.
He also ran a signing campaign to select his representative to get his voice out to the university administration and college management.
Students enrolled in nearly two dozen courses including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Sciences, will be able to choose their representative this year.
More than 6,000 students studying here will get a chance to exercise their franchise for the first time.
The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ashok Kumar said that the University has sought permission from the Governor to hold elections.
The date of the election will be announced as soon as permission is given.
He said that it is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges.
Many college management do not want the student union elections to be held on their campus.
At the same time, elections are not being held because of lack of unity among students.
The council had launched a signature drive for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, department coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to conduct elections in the colleges.
The colleges are also having problems with the lack of clarity regarding the student union election.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of gold and silver in the capital.
Such purchases have increased by 20 to 30 per cent over last year.
The jewellery shops in Shimla were crowded with longos.
The shoppers also saw a huge crowd in the decorative pottery shops from Lower Bazaar to Malrod.
Although such items are on a high this year, people have not been shy about shopping on the auspicious occasion.
The best time for shopping on Friday was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and from 1:56 am to 3:37 am and from 6:17 am to 8:12 am.
During these three Muhurtas, crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla flocked to buy more.
In Shimla Lower Market, there was no place for people to stand.
The crowd in every small store was similar.
Shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Dhantrayodashi, the Triad of the Krishna side of the month of Kartik, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama Health Care Act
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the health care law named after Barack Obama constitutional.
By a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which would require citizens to buy or pay a penalty for health insurance before 2014 - as constitutional under the government's power to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while other justices Scalia, Thos, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law, saying that the provision of the health care law that states increase Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally oppressive.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business to block the law.
During the 2012 inaugural session, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including projected nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that without money we cannot do our work.
Money is one of the greatest necessities for living, but it is not in our interest to consider it everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the Krishna Tridues of the month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshipped as the god of wealth Kuber and the god of death Yamaraja.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No amount of money is good or bad.
Our feelings towards money are both good and bad.
There can be no more valuable thing than wealth that serves the welfare of humanity, but wealth that causes ego has no meaning.
We should earn money for holy purposes and spend it for holy purposes.
It is the duty of every person to earn money to support his family.
Part of it should be the sense of spending on society, but the tendency to accumulate without account or to earn money in the yen - ken - way destroys our conscience, our personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in mind.
A fraction of the money you give can be the basis of someone 's livelihood.
We should all think about the many people in our society who are living in dire need.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation are given equal importance in the Purushasthana of life.
All people desire wealth and success and they get wealth and success according to their masculinity.
The wealth that is sustained is the wealth with which respect is associated.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he cannot use it properly or be useful to others.
Don 't be jealous of someone else 's wealth.
The real rich man is he who makes the way for wealth to flow into countless hands.
There is no better use of money than creating jobs for others.
Another thing is that money is not just currency.
It could be in the form of your health, your character, your love for others.
Try to become the owner of this money.

Special Judge IS Mehta has sent Ahmed to 14 days' remand, granting NIA's plea after a closed-room hearing.
According to the sources, while bringing Uzair Ahmed before the court, the NIA said that Uzair Ahmed was mainly involved in the incident along with Imtiaz Ansari and Haider, members of the Indian Mujahideen, the main accused in the Patna serial blasts.
Ahmed had introduced several other terrorists to Ansari.
Through the interrogation of Ahmed, the NIA wants to arrest other accused in the case.
The bomb material and the terrorists who made it are still to be found.
To do this, they have to take Ahmed to Bihar, Jharkhand and several states, for which he needs to be remanded.
NIA had arrested Uzair Ahmed, an accused in the Patna serial blasts case, from Ranchi on 30th October.
The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed a day earlier that there was fraud in the 2012 PMT.
STF has found a glitch in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
About 125 of these students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admission of these students can be cancelled.
After the STF disclosure, the Department of Medical Education has started deliberations to revoke the admission of these students.
The department is waiting for the list of all these suspected students to be received from STF.
The list will be sent to the Vyapaman to disqualify the students involved.
However, the department is also talking about seeking legal advice in this matter.
The departmental officials say that the students who have taken admission in the year 2012 have completed one year and hence it is necessary to seek legal advice in this regard.
As the matter is currently confined to the investigation of STF, the medical education officials are not in a position to say anything.
The acting director Tarun Pithore says that if the STF handed over the list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions would be immediately revoked.
Director of Medical Education Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava said that the students have not refused to cancel their admission if it is found that they had fake admissions.
According to STF officials, the fake students involved in PMT 2012 are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to the Vyapaman.
It is to be noted that Vyapaman had disqualified 345 suspected students who had taken the PMT exam in 2013.
Out of these 345, 84 have been withdrawn by the Department of Medical Education so far.
MLA from Poonch assembly constituency, Ajaz Jan inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurdwara Complex.
The MLA said that there are a lot of people coming and going to the gurudwara but due to lack of proper drinking water system, water coolers have been installed.
This will provide people with cold water in hot days.
In winter, pure plain water will be available.
This will solve the problem of drinking water for the pilgrims.
Members of the Gurdwara Committee and others were also present on the occasion.
If the new government after the general election continues with the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then in half a dozen states, these stores will not get kerosene.
The states in which the sale of kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the Northeast are also preparing to ban the sale of kerosene.
The decision to close the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states will be taken on two bases, according to sources in the Ministry of Petroleum.
The first is to provide rapid electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped in the states where most rural households have been given LPG connections.
The Ministry of Petroleum has prepared for this.
PDS kerosene has already been discontinued in Delhi since October 2013.
Sources said that under this policy, the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been significantly reduced.
The quota for Punjab was reduced from 2. 72 lakh to 1 lakh litres.
The allocation of kerosene in Uttarakhand was reduced by 70 per cent and in Haryana by about 40 per cent.
Despite this cut, there have been no reports of kerosene shortages from these states.
The Ministry is accepting that it is clear that kerosene has been used for blending.
The price difference between PDS kerosene and diesel is currently Rs. 37.
This encourages the mixers.
In states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs. 31, 000 crore.
The accused used to open investors ' accounts under the name of trading firm and fraudulently bought and sold shares.
This is the first time in the state that a scam of crores of rupees has been revealed.
The gang leader has not been identified but seven people have been arrested including the accused who was seen working in the state.
The gang operated a fake commodity market called MetaTrader - 5.
The company 's shareholders used to take cash from investors and give it to them by creating fake IDs on a fake software.
This allowed the accused to see the shares bought by investors when trading.
It even revealed which shares were bought at what price.
In fact, no shares were bought or any transactions were made as no demat account was opened for investors and the shares were shown as fake on this fake software.
Police are speculating that hundreds of people have joined the gang.
From two to five lakh rupees were invested in the name of profit from each investor.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been taken into custody by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while six other accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, it is necessary for any stock trading company to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company get the shares traded through it to investors.
The investor then opens a demat account to buy and sell shares, but this company called MetaTrader 5 was not affiliated with any exchange or trading stocks.
The company bought a server for itself on 24 September 2012 under the name WinTrade.
Since then, people have been deceived in the name of investing through this company.
Eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to complain to the cyber cell.
Even after selling the shares he bought at a profit, the amount was not transferred to the account.
He demanded a profit from the company 's shareholders.
Investors are even saying that the fake IDs they were given always showed the price of their purchased shares at a lower price.
The price was fixed by the accused at his own level.

The players of this team keep making new records on the day of the Test and now their status is gradually increasing in the ODI.
A great example of this was seen on Thursday when the well-placed New Zealand team was beaten by Bangladesh in the ODI series to take the title.
With the sharp bowling of Sohag Ghazi and Musharaf Murtaza, Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to take an unbeaten 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win against New Zealand in ODI cricket.
New Zealand had earlier lost the series 0-4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's 248 run target, New Zealand lost the wickets at regular intervals to the spin of Ghazi (34/3) and the stormy bowling of Murtaja (43/3), leaving the team stuck at 207 in 46.4 overs.
Ross Taylor scored 45 while Corey Anderson scored 37 for New Zealand.
Kyle Mills scored 27 not out while Nathan McCallum contributed 25 runs, but no batsman of the team could convert the good start into a big innings which led to the team losing.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite Tamim Iqbal (58) scoring a half century.
Anderson and James Neesham combined for eight wickets.
Anderson took four wickets for 40 runs while Neesham took four wickets for 53 runs.
Tamim has become the highest run scorer for Bangladesh in ODIs.

The current Gate City Circle office building, which is earning crores of rupees a day to the Punjab State Power Corporation, is running in ruins.
In such a situation, all employees are forced to work in fear of accidents.
The day after the cement fell from the roofs of the building, the staff was in a panic.
The building, built in 1913 in the British era, was formerly the office of the Municipal Corporation.
In 1995 the building was handed over to the power board.
The department is making a big deal out of it by having it painted in the name of repairs.
The building is in such a state of disrepair that the staff are afraid to sit in it.
The building is in such a fragile condition that the plaster often falls from the roofs.
In the last month alone, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
A female employee has also been injured.
The JE and the Revenue Accountant survived the accident.
At present, about four and a half hundred employees work in the building.
It consists of 5 XEN, 12 SDO, 20 junior engineers, 130 clerical staff, 200 technical staff and 20 other staff members including SE.
However, nothing has been done by the Powercom officials about their safety.
Three rooms allotted to the JE's in the building, scooter and bicycle stand, two rooms on the upper floor have completely collapsed.
In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily guessed.

BJP Prime Minister candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Deenath Mangeshkar Hospital, lashed out at the Congress while addressing an election rally on Friday.
Speaking on the occasion, PM said, "Sometimes coalition governments have been formed in many states and the Centre, sometimes Congress governments, sometimes Communist governments, sometimes BJP governments.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be set in the country.
What did the party do?
If the results are comparable, the country will not have to question whether the BJP should come to power.
Every time the BJP has been in power, there has been an effort to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country has witnessed the low inflation under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai governments.
The poor man got food at two times.
But when the Congress or the government supported by it came to power, the poor man was not fortunate enough to eat well.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is answering for what they have done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They don 't even answer the media.
The elections are for the Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal, saying, "The question is being asked of Modi every day. Every year when the people bless the BJP in 2014, they will give an account of their work before the people.
In a democracy, Delhi should be a servant, not a ruler.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, only slaves.
The Congress friends keep dropping balloons on the day they come.
Congressmen, we have already passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people take the exam.
In the case of Nortel patents, Google, Samsung, Huawei are being sued for financial gain.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a number of patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers, which it overtook in the Nortel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
The Rockstar consortium that bought the Noratel patents for $4.5 billion has sued Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies in the U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The indictment said the patents also included technology that combines search terms on the internet with words from consistent advertising, which is a core part of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is in stiff competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had made an initial bid of $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google raised the bid several times and finally offered $ 4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in the Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a major reason for which was Motorola having a long list of patents.
The indictment said that "Despite losing the bid to acquire the patents in the auction, Google has violated, and continues to violate".
Rockstar has sought increased damages against Google, allegedly because of its claim that Google's patent infringement is malicious.
They believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt.
Mohamed Morsi has been sworn in, but his victory day has hardly brought an end to the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
Upon his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi becomes the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth since the overthrow of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He was sworn in on his chair by 18 black-robed judges of the court on the banks of the Nile, which resembled an ancient Egyptian temple.
During the ceremony, which was broadcast live on national television, Morsi said: "We are looking forward to a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic".
Morsi, 60, a U.S.-trained engineer for the radical Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its inception as an outlawed organization and has been targeted by previous governments, said: "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability".
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Apart from the President's thunderous days, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, even with traffic stopped for a short time to allow their motorcade to leave the normally busy road that connects the city centre to its southern suburbs.
Mocked as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "empty tire", Morsi's personal standing rose sharply after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him as the candidate not just for Islamists but for all those who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Morsi, wearing a blue business suit and red tie, took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying that "today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern nation".
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was given an official welcome by the military band playing the national anthem while standing in a posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people in the lecture hall at the main university there welcomed him with the slogan "Army and people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and vowed to take back presidential powers stripped from the ousted leader by the military council last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court rather than the customary oath of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the army, which indicates that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi 's speech at Tahrir Square was filled with dramatically popular poses.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases American espionage had gone too far.
He also claimed that innocent people were not tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.

Meanwhile, a key US parliamentary committee has approved a bill limiting surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the trust of people who have been hurt by the revelation of mass phone tapes.
The Senate's move has been welcomed by six US companies including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also infiltrated the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Intelligence Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA] that targets the NSA by a vote of 11 to 4.
The bill outlines several restrictions, including a one-time ban on phone tapping under the USA Patriot Act.
Under FISA, the use of data collected intentionally and unauthorized will be considered a crime and punishable by up to ten years in prison.
The Bill will become law after passing in both Houses of Congress House of Representatives and Senate.
Chairperson of the committee and Senator Diane Feustin said the NSA's phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only this, but the protection of public privacy must also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook, outraged by the revelation of the NSA's Internet surveillance program, have supported the bill.
In a letter to senators, the companies said they welcome the MPs' proposal to curb the NSA's massive phone recording.
It is noteworthy that the NSA 's activities were exposed in documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden.
The international community is deeply outraged after the NSA's disclosure of surveillance of telephone conversations of heads of state from 35 countries, including Germany and France.

A recent media report said that the NSA had leaked information from Yahoo and Google data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has made the disclosure based on documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The NSA's program was called Muscular, which it ran in conjunction with its British counterpart GCHQ, according to the report.
The two agencies stole data passing through the massive fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, which said that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just three days of the program's launch.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post - the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to this information.
The newspaper said it was easier for the NSA to run the program outside the US, as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
NSA chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, this has never happened".
The NSA has always gathered all information within the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration had assured it would not monitor its communications system.
The US has also said that the UN communications system is not monitored.

Schools have chosen to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
The test will also include "Not Seen Text" to encourage more reading.
A joint English Literature and Language course will be abolished.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of incentive to choose English Literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Maths tomorrow - these will be the first subjects to be revolutionized.
It will also change other key subjects in the coming year.
In a separate step, the exam regulator will demonstrate changes in the structure of GCSE with off - course, new grading system, and reduced curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a very high consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore confidence", adding that GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools spend less time on mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours less a week during the semester than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While, there would be no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that the wider mathematics combined with subjects in the GCSE - league table for more weight was likely to encourage additional teaching in schools.
The course will focus more on "real world problems" including financial mathematics.

They are damaging their image and reporting one-sidedly.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies he could use.
Surrounded by the opposition 's questions at the railway gate, Pawan Bansal once put the opposition in a corner by saying that he had not looked at a woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised to see where the woman 's words came from.
Perhaps Bansal was pointing to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter around, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had unsuccessfully plotted to get a woman to complain behind him during the last parliamentary elections.
Speaking to reporters, Bansal said that he has been questioned by the CBI in the rail bribery case.
If he had been made a witness in the case, would he have been made only after a full investigation?
Bansal said that he had written a letter to only one needy person in the booth scam he was talking about.
If that is their sin, they will continue to do so.
He said that although the Corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the Opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development work is concerned, the list of development work for 15 years will be given to the opposition.
They cannot even imagine the development of Chandigarh as it is being or is going to be.
The two exchanged greetings during the Cabinet meeting.
When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister for his speech in the reflection camp for retaliating against Narendra Modi.
He also said that he had no other motivation in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
The new challenges must be met with determination.
The Chief Minister also had the same expression on his face that he took Singh 's speech positively.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers at the Chittan camp and protect them from alleged harassment by the officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be dismissed from the Cabinet to keep his word.
By the way, after the opinion that has emerged in the reflection camp, there are fresh ideas in the matter of seating workers in government posts.
At the camp, Pradesh JDU President Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that nominations of the workers in the 20 point committees would be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will examine the list himself from his level.
They will also check whether the views of the MLAs have been taken into account in the listing.
The list will be extensively revised to accommodate older and committed workers if necessary.
The common complaint of MLAs is that their views were not taken into account in the list of nominations.
The names of those who came much later from other parties have been included in the list while many important activists active from the days of the Samaj Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, others make their life ideal through their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhan Das Ambani, a school teacher in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on 28 December 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third of five siblings.
The family has five children including Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial hardship, Dhirubhai had to quit after high school.
Dhirubhai had started helping the family financially at a very young age.
At that time he had a shop of vegetables near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists who came here.
Dhirubhai's first job was in 1949 when he arrived in Aden, Yemen, on a ship called Kabota at the age of 17.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai 's mind.
So in 1954 he returned to his homeland.
In 1955 he arrived in Mumbai with Rs. 500 in his pocket to try his luck.
And that was where his professional journey began.
From here Dhirubhai Ambani took such a step that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only at home but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left this world on 6th July 2002.
At that time he owned Rs 62,000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are in charge of his sultanate.
Like their father, these two brothers are now internationally renowned businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

JAGARAN BURO, Srinagar: The security of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party, has reportedly been removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this and said that his security had been removed for political reasons.
It may be noted that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti, who won the elections in 2002 on the ticket of the PDP from Shopian, was a member of the cabinet of Ghulam Hassan Khan while Mohammad Saeed was the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have been getting the protection shield since 1996.
I live in the shopias, which are called the stronghold of terrorists.
A CRPF security team led by a sub inspector was stationed at my house.
I have a bodyguard with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security team was passing by my house, I spoke to the district deputy commissioner and the district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he simply said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted in this regard, IGP of Kashmir Abdul Ghani Mir denied any knowledge of the matter, saying that it is a sensitive matter.
I will personally investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader was removed.
The head of the state Congress, Prof. Saifuddin Sojse, said that nothing of this kind is known to me.
If the security of Hassan Khan is compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at the moment and will be in Kashmir in the next day or two.
I will discuss the issue with the concerned administration.
According to the report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore during the last four years to celebrate Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
Contrary to Modi 's claims, there was a period during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004) when no advertisement was issued by the government for Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-meter-high Statue of Unity of Sardar Patel in Kevadia, Gujarat on Thursday, PM said, "Before, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's Jayanti.
While DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel ads.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Minister for Information Broadcasting Manish Tiwari said that BJP PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA had failed to get any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel 's advertisements is far less than the amount spent on the birthdays and anniversaries of members of the Nehru - Gandhi family every year.
DAVP spent Rs. 33 crore on print ads for the birth and death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs. 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs. 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs. 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about the difference, Manish Tiwari said, 'It should not be seen in terms of advertising spending.
Because the price of an ad depends on many things, including things like the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year etc.
The fact is that it shows our dedication to the people who are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without even knowing it.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, Narendra Modi's second visit to Patna has seen tight security arrangements in place.
The police conducted a thorough search of Modi's travel route and meeting places.
People attending meetings will be watched by the police.
The Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will monitor the security.
Modi 's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, the BJP's Osti Kalsh Yatra, which was carried out to remember the dead in the Patna blast, has also been questioned.
State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar alleged that the BJP is trying to spoil the atmosphere.
Moving through soil, rivers and forest to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Vail, delivering free healthcare to rural areas of Cameroon
Val and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
West African countries do not have many doctors; there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
Vote here or by mobile
Dr. Georges Weil is one of the top 10 heroes of the year 2013 on CNN.
You can vote for him or for anyone else in the top 10 to make CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Weil watched his ailing father come to and from a hospital that was not adequately equipped to assist him.
Jamil Whel was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital of Yaoundé in 1981.
At first he had only a broken arm, but an infection spread to his brain, and it produced a blood clot that affected the rest of his life.
Georges Weil says, "There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon".
If we had money, we would have taken my father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Val kept taking his father around overcrowded clinics and hospitals and getting whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy", said Vail.
You leave home at 5 a.m. expecting to be the first person to arrive at the hospital, but you don't.
There are many patients there.
Some people may die while waiting.
The situation has not changed much since Val's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people.
For comparison, there is one physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many Cameroonians cannot afford them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and about two thirds of the expenditure on healthcare in the country is in the private sector.
Well says, "Their only problem is poverty".
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Vail resolved to do something about it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself, and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yaoundé.
And he started a nonprofit organization called Esquima, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped around 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and about 30 people sit in vans, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical treatment.
Sometimes luck is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they receive a truly heroic honor: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is truly a cause for celebration, and the Welsh - with their big smiles and endless energy - are joyously involved.
The next morning, his team begins to see hundreds of patients.
"We meet 500 people on each trip", said Vail.
They come from about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a wide range of medical services.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get a backpack, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- a document required by the school but not affordable to many poor families.
In the evening the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed at a school building, town hall or home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery area, making room for the next person.
The group's generator lights up the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers get up early on Sunday to work.
It is a backbreaking pace, but the village musicians usually help keep the band motivated.
"They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and keep up their work", said Vail.
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
The group - which includes Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world for the people they help.
One person said that he will be able to return to work as he received free hernia surgery.
The man said, "This will change my future and my family's future".
Apart from running a clinic on weekends and working as a surgeon in a hospital, Val also works at night in a private medical clinic around Yaoundé.
He said this is his second job which funds 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is done by private donations.
"I don't know when they're asleep", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in the Well group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to raise money for their organization, so that they can continue to run these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Well campaign, this is a trial opportunity they could never have in their own country.
"We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgeries in which we help Dr. Well to hold tools or clean up blood spots", said O'Malley.
As a second-year medical student in the US, you will never have the opportunity to do that.
Volunteer students usually travel at their own expense to Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But once the young have arrived, they bear the cost of their commuting and instruction.
O'Malley says, "There's no doubt they are heroes".
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For Well, the workload is almost the same, not the difficulty.
Helping others to live happy lives, fulfilling a promise to their father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
"I find it very rewarding to do this", says Val.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.
Visit the Esquima website and find out how to help.
You may not believe it, but it is true.
Not only this, Mission Road has been named after Anjali Kumari, the Chairperson of the Municipal Council.
The name was chosen by the Jharkhand Vikas Yuthala Morcha to express their displeasure over some of the city 's run down streets.
The event was led by JAMMO Central Secretary Sachidananda Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "If you look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, you will find that they do not talk about what they have done".
He said, "Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media".
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and he has a government, yet he needs an answer from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the public.
Apparently, Modi was responding to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants a controlled environment where he gives his speech and does not speak to reporters to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to debate face to face.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year", Modi said.
The Congress has given tickets again to all the old MLAs.

Apasana has been asked to take over the state office and visit anywhere in the state if needed.
As many officials including Pradesh President Ramsevak Paikra and General Minister Shivaratan Sharma are contesting the elections, Organisation General Minister Rampratap is alone.
This has given worship a great responsibility.
RDA Chairman Sunil Soni, who was the contender from the North seat, has been given the responsibility of conducting the election for the Raipur South seat.
Another claimant, Sanjay Srivastava, the Municipal Corporation Chairman, has been placed on the Provincial Welcome Committee.
They will help in the transportation of the party 's star campaigners, national leaders.

He said that after the Havan Yajna, a huge Bhandara was organized in collaboration with the townspeople, where people of all faiths of the city received offerings and blessings.
Obama's health care proposal withdrawn
Amid a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his oft-repeated misleading promise that "you can continue your health plan if you like it".
With millions of people receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American citizens.
Yesterday Obama changed his real message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and it's useful, can continue to have it".
Addressing what he calls a "news flash" about the repeal, Obama has granted the US citizens who receive this information the benefit of buying new coverage on the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, a comprehensive health care plan for the same money or cheaper than offered.
He said, "You'll get a better deal".
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that the 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the required standards under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I say to these American citizens, 'You deserve better than this.'"
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
He said, "I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else".
I want to win back your trust.
After a sharp knockdown with Republicans at a House hearing yesterday, Sebelius angrily said this sentence to a colleague sitting behind him, which was picked up by a mike.
In a hearing lasting more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily forgo government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.
The case of ransom of Rs. 2 lakh being demanded from the businessman was brought to light.
The daughter has been threatened with being taken away if she does not pay.
The case registered at Hudkeshwar police station is being solved with the help of the Cyber Crime Cell.
Narendra Bahar, 21, from Ayodhya Nagar, owns an electronics shop.
Between 25th and 29th, someone called her mobile from different mobile numbers.
The caller demanded Rs. 2 lakh as ransom.
Narendra is threatened with death or his daughter 's resurrection if he does not.
Narendra did not take the threat seriously at first, but when the threats began to escalate and the matter came to his daughter, who was studying in class 12, he became disturbed.
The family members are in fear.
On Thursday, a complaint was lodged.
So far no leads have been found for the accused.
The Cyber Crime Cell is being called in to help in view of the seriousness of the case.
Apart from this, MP Badal also held a concerted Darshan Sangam in the villages of Bhagyavandar, Bandar Patti, Laleana, Jjal, Phullo Khari, Gatwali and Malkana, heard the difficulties of the people and instructed the officials on the spot to solve them.
The MP also released grants for the development of villages.
He directed the Panchayats to use the grants for development of villages to provide facilities to the villagers. He took stock of the current paddy procurement arrangements in the village of Bhagyavandar.
He gave a sewing machine, plants and certificates to 15 girls who had received sewing training.
During this period, 400 Congress and PPP in Bhagyavandar village, 35 Congress and PPP in Laleyana and 71 families in Jal village joined Shiromani Akali Dal except Congress and PPP.
Badal said that Punjab farmers are being insulted in the mandis due to the criteria set by the Centre for the procurement of paddy, while the Punjab farmer has always been biased by the Centre.
He was accompanied by D.C. K. K. Yadav, S.S.P. Ravcharan Singh Barad, ADC D. Sonali Giri, ADC Rajiv Parashar, S.D.M. Shruti Sharma, District In-charge of Talwandi Sabo Balveer Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk, administrative officers and Akali leaders from various departments.
This has led to a decrease in the number of cases of code violations.
Since the Code of Electoral Conduct came into force on 4th October, 313 cases had been registered against various political parties till 21st October.
From October 22 to 27, only 31 cases have been reported.
With the implementation of the Electoral Code of Conduct, there were cases of violations.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but gradually, it has started to decrease.
It is being told that in the early days, there were more complaints against political parties due to lack of knowledge about the Code of Conduct.
The Election Commission has been making less complaints because of the political parties being made aware and learning lessons from the case.
Many parties were campaigning as before in the absence of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following the Code of Electoral Conduct by getting information about it.
This is also reducing the number of violations.
A proposal has been sent to the Governor by ADA in this regard which is soon to be sealed.
There is no plot left in this historic city surrounded by the Ganges and Yamuna on three sides on which ADA can develop any major housing project.
In this regard, he has now planned to plan the residential development from Jhansi in the east, from Fapamau in the north and from Naini in the south.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Raj Shekhar to elaborate on the plan.
ADA has envisaged the inclusion of 200 revenue villages of Phulpur, Soram and Karchna.

Half of Kaudihar block will also be merged into ADA.
According to ADA Secretary Amarnath Upadhyay, a proposal has been sent to the government in this regard.
ADA wants to take the boundaries of these Gram Panchayats under its jurisdiction for planning, which will be started soon.
If this happens, the rising cost of buildings in the city will be reduced.
At the same time, the common man will have easy access to housing.
Soon residential palaces will be built in this new area along the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

The human population has crossed 7 billion.
If the population continues to grow at this rate, the time will soon come when it will be difficult to provide food for every hungry person.
Experts say that in the near future, humans will have no choice but to eat insects.
According to reports, a group of students from McGill University in Montreal won the Hult Prize for a unique project this year.
He has been awarded for making protein flour from insects.
As a prize, he has been given a grant of $1 million to further his research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30, Mohammed Eshor, the group's chief student researcher, said that his team will now experiment with locusts for food.
The report contains detailed information on edible insects.

Asaram, who is in judicial custody at Central Jail here for allegedly sexually assaulting a minor student, will celebrate this year 's Diwali in jail.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused of raping a girl from Surat.
Meanwhile, his son Narayan Sai is on the run from the police.

Asaram and his son are facing various charges.
But even so, the superstition of many of his devotees is not going away.
Asaram has a dominance not only in India but also in America.
Here in India, Asaram may be in jail and devotees are moving away from him, but not in America.
In the Ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still coming to the Ashram as before.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage had "gone inappropriately far".
John Kerry has unexpectedly signaled a softening of the US protective attitude to its surveillance program by admitting that sometimes its spying "goes inappropriately far".
The Secretary of State has also admitted that he is guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on "autopilot" as a rebellious revelation to whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities.
This revelation has thrown the U. S. government into a diplomatic quake with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, myself, and others in the government were actually aware of some of the things that were going on with autopilot, because looking back on World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 it had potential.
He has become the first high-ranking member of the US government to admit that US espionage has crossed its line, but to insist that no one's rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately".
The President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is now conducting a thorough review to ensure that no one feels abused.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed that, however, the NSA was working for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up".
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
So what's the problem if you can stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented planes from crashing, buildings from collapsing, and people from being killed because we have been able to know about the plans of others in advance.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that US lawmakers would travel to Europe to help address concerns overseas about so-called US espionage, and would try to convince European countries of the need to continue joint anti-corruption efforts with the US.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats to stop his involvement in counterterrorism organizations because of frustration with the National Security Agency over surveillance.
Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington, "It is really important to U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in the context of our counterterrorism efforts".
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of European phone conversations have strained relations with some US allies, although the agency's head said the reports were not entirely accurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the UN.
Other revelations in documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, defended the alleged spying on allies as necessary and said it was common practice for both sides to do so.
Amid the commotion, Murphy said his office was arranging a trip to Congress that is likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators will be released in the coming days.
He said that work is still underway on the itinerary.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some "impractical relations" would also have to be abandoned.
He said European leaders must be honest with their people, as well as with their spy programs used for years.
"While we can revise our surveillance programme to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carey is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will address issues ranging from U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to U.S. surveillance activities.
A new policy of board changes has started in the municipalities.
Recently, the Congress - led Board of Councillors in Saithiya Municipality of Virbhum district was converted to Trinamool Board due to a change of party.
This change was due to the fact that most of the Congress councillors including the chairman of the municipality joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress but also some MPs from the CPI, BJP and Forward Bloc have also suppressed the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai sees this as a good sign for the party.
He says that 10 Congress councillors including Saithiya Municipal Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta joined the Trinamool.
Some Left Front MPs, including the CPI, have also held the Trinamool flag.
All have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and that the Samithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool as per the Numbers Force.
Shri Rai also claims that the blueprint for development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is agreed upon by all.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, MACPA, BJP, and Forward Bloc are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.
The deserving leaders of any party are welcome in Trinamool.
The Trinamool takeover of the Municipal Board is being seen as important in political circles due to the change of Congress councillors in Saithiya Municipality ahead of the November 22 municipal elections.
The former is the case in the left - led Haldia and Nadia, where the Trinamool has also taken over the Congress - led municipal board.
When the Municipal Board is occupied by the Trinamool in the districts due to party change, party members are greeted at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai is excited about the leaders joining the Trinamool breaking away from other parties.
He says that those who break away from any party are welcome in the Trinamool.
He claims that people's confidence is growing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, which has resulted in people wanting to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the MACPA, says that lower level leaders from other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress out of fear of terror.
The MACPA is treating the change in the board of elected local bodies as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its membership, but the justification for changing the vote in the matter of power is inevitable.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false accusations against Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver, along with two other individuals, tried to stop her on the morning of Sunday, June 10.
But later CCTV footage revealed that she had returned safely to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Bamfort confessed to fabricating the story when questioned by Phuket police for two days.
He was held in a local police cell before his trial in court.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tunks, who has petitioned the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to assist his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and wanted to bring her back to Australia.
"It has undoubtedly been a worrying time for us, but we hope she will be back home soon", Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the sentence and has been granted bail of 50,000 baht.
Meanwhile, reports in Australia said she was vacationing at the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Thai-based legal sources said Bamford's case was being fought by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court extending his sentence to two years and committing him to adult custody.
Similarly, following the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be acquitted in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Sitting on Bishnoi, the MP said that one cannot be a benefactor of the poor by taking a day off at a special community home and posting pictures of himself eating Churma.
