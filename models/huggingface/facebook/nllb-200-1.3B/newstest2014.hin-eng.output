The black box in your car?
While road planners in the U.S. are struggling with a lack of funds to repair a crumbling highway system, many are looking for a solution in the little black box that fits neatly on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to officials, has become the subject of a controversial effort by Washington and the state Planning Office to restore the outdated system for financing America's major roads.
Boring tasks like highway planning have suddenly become the subject of intense debate and lively alliances.
Libertarian environmental groups have joined forces to mobilize support for allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive - and then use this information to draft tax bills.
The tea party is a blast.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned, raising various privacy issues.
While Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states were not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move to a system where the driver pays for every mile he travels on the road in the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
It is a truly indispensable commodity for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not", says Hassan Ikharata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to start tracking every mile driven by motorists in California by 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason for this is that the country's Highway Trust Fund, which is financed by taxes paid by US citizens on gas pumps, has almost gone bankrupt.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Now a car runs more miles than ever at a gallon of gas.
There has been no increase in the federal tax over the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Politicians avoid raising a penny in tax because of the high price of gas.
"The gas tax is not sustainable at all", says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the mile-payment system.
"It will work as the most rational option in the long run", he says.
Woonx calls this mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, as it could, for example, lead to tax changes to change the way people drive, which could help reduce congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
California planners are keen on the system as they develop strategies to meet the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the House Transportation Committee, Rep. Bill Shuster (A.P.A.), also considers the black box the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favour of payment per mile by the driver.
"It's not just taxes going into the blind well", said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy in the region.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been endorsed by two former US Transportation Secretaries, who in their 2011 report had graciously asked Congress to move towards mileage payments.
The US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year, involving 10,000 cars.
But acting on the concerns of rural legislators, who were representing individuals who had to walk many miles to get to work or to the city every day, the House leadership ended the motion on the spot.
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most interested is Oregon, which has enlisted 5,000 drivers in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state mileage fee instead of gas tax.
Nevada has already completed preliminary testing.
New York City is moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 states along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on the cars of 50 volunteer car drivers, drivers were very impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
"The main problem was worrying about Big Brother and other things like that", says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people wanted.
As the test progressed, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It will be quite easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices".
There is no need to develop a vast, unmanageable technological infrastructure, which must necessarily be spread out to keep track of the daily comings and goings of each person.
Nevada is among the many states that are making every effort to acquire affordable technology that will allow the state to get details of how many miles a car is driving per day, but not where and when it is driving.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California startup called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax collectors.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, where drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing pleased highway planners, as it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at fixed intervals.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they're more likely to adopt this approach", said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There have been some major mistakes in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also much less costly and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They can choose GPS - equipped or non - GPS - equipped devices.
Or again, they may choose not to take any devices, but to pay a fixed fee based on the average miles travelled by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience instead of less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that would also allow parking meter fees to be paid, provide "pay per drive" insurance, and build real-time collection of speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic.
The city planning document states, "Motorists will be attracted to participate because of the benefits it will bring".
However, some transport planners wonder whether all the talk of paying by mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress could very easily address the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising the gas tax.
Drivers of hybrid or other cars may also be charged an additional one time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
"What is the need for radical surgery when aspirin can work", said Randy Rentscheller, the commission's director of legislative and public affairs.
If we do that, millions of motorists will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
According to the police, she died by drowning.
However, his friend has been detained by the police for hiding the deceased 's belongings.
The police have submitted the final report of the inquest into the death to the court.
It is known that on 26th August, police had recovered the body of Padshahi Bagh resident Zahid Iqbal in Jhelum Darya.
His family had accused his friends of his murder because his mobile phone and other belongings were missing.
Police said in the report that the deceased's phone and SIM were examined and it was found that his phone was being used by a woman in Saura.
The woman told interrogation that she had received the phone from a relative of her, Ruhal Gauhar.
Ruhal also lives in Padshahi Bagh and was a friend of late Zahid.
Ruhal had taken a bath in Jhelum with Zahid after the Friday prayer on August 25.
Zahid took off his clothes and put all his belongings on the side, while Ruhal went to the other side to smoke.
When he came back, Zahid was not there, he had only clothes.
Ruhal searched for Zahid, but he was not found.
He took his mobile phone, watch and other belongings and put them to his use.
He didn 't tell anyone that Zahid had drowned.
The police informed the court that Zahid died from drowning and it was confirmed in the post mortem.
However, Ruhal has been detained under Section 404 for concealing facts and possessions of the deceased.

Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 77, who is known for his bungee parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old woman.
This was revealed by his family friend Martel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in her private chapel.
Francesca met Blusconi when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
This is Francesca, whose relationship with Balrusconi was said to be a sham.
Berlusconi's close friend and bang - bang girl Martel Polanco has revealed that she too was invited to the secret wedding.
This ceremony has taken place three weeks ago.
In an interview on Italian Radio 2, when asked what would happen if the two married, Polanco said that they were already married.
It was not a public function.
The wedding took place in a private chapel at the former Prime Minister 's house.
Nothing more can be said.
She did not go to this wedding, though.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
The two got married about three weeks ago, on October 8 or 9.
About eight months ago, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than herself, Francesca Pascal, was engaged.
To avoid the bitter, Berlusconi based his decision on loneliness.
Even in the lowlands, the rain continued intermittently, with the sun shining.
With this, the whole valley has started to cool.
The cold weather can be estimated from the fact that the minimum temperature has reached 4.8 degrees Celsius in Srinagar, -0.2 degrees below zero in Gulmarg and -1.8 degrees Celsius in Leh.
Leh was the coldest in the whole state.
Meanwhile, the strategically important Srinagar - Leh National Highway has been closed to traffic due to rain and snowfall.
There has been heavy snowfall at Jojila Pass.
This is the fourth and first heavy snowfall of the season in the hilly areas of Kashmir.
The activity of the Western disturbance started at dawn on Wednesday, with snowfall in the highlands and rainfall in the lowlands, which continued till late evening.
The cold affected the life of the people.
People stayed indoors to avoid the cold wave.
Meanwhile, power supply was also stalled in many areas.
Srinagar recorded maximum daytime temperature of 13.7 degrees below normal.
At the same time, the cold has increased at night due to heavy rains in Jammu.
Minimum temperature was recorded at 16.6 and maximum at 27.0 degrees Celsius in Jammu.
According to the Meteorological Department, the impact of the Western Disturbance has started to diminish and the weather will improve from Friday.
According to Sonam Lott, Director, Meteorological Department, Srinagar, from November 1 to November 1 to 7, the weather in Wadi is likely to be dry.
Asaram, who is in jail on charges of sexual assault, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
Media coverage alleged by Asaram portrayed him as a child bloodsucking Dracula, but the court rejected his demand to block media coverage.
The bench of Chief Justice P. Sathivam refused to order the media to stop reporting on Asaram, saying that they have seen every word reported in the media and see no reason to interfere.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and other people?
Earlier, Asaram 's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating the news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
But the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the case, saying that they had other options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram 's demand to block media coverage.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest case of TDS theft so far.
The Group Operator of the Mall paid the TDS to the relevant financial institutions but did not pay it to the Government Treasury.
He kept on accumulating the TDS.
The group was targeted on October 17 by an investigation team from Mumbai, in conjunction with the Jaipur Investigation Team.
In the same investigation, it was found that the trader had deducted the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
The risk of account sealing was raised about 15 days ago when the group of this mall operator was raided and surveyed.
The trader, outraged by this action, has made it clear to the Income Tax Department officials that he is not ready to pay the TDS to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and taking action.
The investigating officers in this matter have clarified that in case of non-payment, the recovery will be effected by sealing the account.
The demand for sweets increases with the coming of Diwali.
This leads to an increase in sales of inferior and counterfeit maves.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more bright, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous to health.
The Food and Drug Administration has launched a campaign against counterfeit mawas and chemical sweets.
The department seized 70 thousand of Mawa from Madhya Pradesh and 5 thousand of spoon from Quetta Colony.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for low - quality mave from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The Information Department got the information of the muddy raw materials brought from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
A consignment of mawe is being ordered from the transport garage to Nagpur.
The department seized the mave, which was valued at Rs.
No one claimed the Mawe for fear of action.
The department considered it as unclaimed property and destroyed it.
The department raided Jitendra Caters at Quetta Colony and recovered about 5 thousand spoons.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to make the glow glow and last longer.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, Co-Commissioner of the Department said that the campaign to catch chemical sweets and fake and fake maves will continue.
The Department has informed that the campaign will be further accelerated in the next few days.
Consumption of these sweets can also lead to poisoning.
The department asked the confectioners to make sweets from good milk, raw.
The Department has appealed to the people to beware of counterfeit sweets and maves.
He was greeted at the airport by 42 senior BJP leaders.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to Bihar for the Consolation Yatra organized by the BJP.
The Consolation Yatra is a ritual of the BJP to offer the marmalade to the relatives of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
It is noteworthy that a total of seven blasts were recorded in Patna during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally on October 27.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts had the intention of making a run - off during the rally so that more people would be killed and the state would be in a state of panic.
The terrorists' plot failed, but six people were killed in the blasts.
They have all been declared martyrs by the BJP.
The party leaders have been on a journey from their village since Thursday.
On November 5th, the bones of all of them will be poured into the Ganga in Patna.
The Consolation Journey is organized as part of this journey.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of the victims of the blasts and meet their families from 7 am on Saturday.
During the visit, he will also hand over a check of Rs.
The BJP has already announced this financial assistance.
The Indian team, excited by the spectacular victory in the previous match, will aim to capture the series with a win when they play their seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
India had to win Nagpur ODI at any rate to stay in the series after two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain and its batsmen gave it a record win with a spectacular performance, which tied the series at 2-2.
Team India has twice achieved the target of over 350 runs in the series and once again the responsibility of the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and even the biggest target is turning out to be a dwarf.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as the opener is concerned, Rohit and Shikhar have got an opening pair which is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had a great partnership in the opening and gave Virat the opportunity to play without any pressure.
With Virat Kohli's performance so far in the third position, he is considered as the Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Many cricket pundits have even called him better than Sachin.
Virat, who will turn 25 next week, has already scored 17 ODI centuries, of which India has won 16.
His average is above 80.00 while chasing the target and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but too much reliance on these three can be detrimental to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bengaluru ODI can be a lifeline for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
There is also a demand for him to be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Besides Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Vogs and James Faulkner have also batted well in the series.
Phil Huinz and Aaron Finch, however, have not been able to make an impact in the opening.
The absence of Mitchell Johnson in bowling could be a huge blow to Australia.
Johnson, who has performed exceptionally well so far in the series, has been sent home for the Ashes series preparations.
BJP National Executive Member and Chief Spokesperson Dr Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltration of terrorists under the guise of this sham peace.
Citing intelligence agencies reports, Singh said in a statement here on Thursday that Pakistan is pushing hard to infiltrate its training camps with about 2000 ready-made terrorists.
He will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan is further divided after the separatists' plans to incite people to commit mass atrocities in Kashmir failed.
Citing the visit of the separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI chief Lt. Gen. Zaheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb's chief Hafeez Saeed and Saeed Salauddin had assured that terrorism would be given a blast in 2014.
Pakistan is committed to fulfilling this promise seriously.
The killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Calling the demand to abolish the privileges of the army in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that it is also anti-people to talk about such things until there is permanent peace in the state.
They give honey to anti - patriotic elements.
He stressed that the leaders should stop making statements that discourage the army, security forces.
Snowden ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US reconnaissance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence informant, has announced that he is ready to travel to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to respond to his activities.
German MP Hans Christian Straubelle met Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum, to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP said in a letter presented to the media by Mr Snowden in Berlin on Friday: 'While the results of my efforts are positively positive, my government considers dissent as a party change, and does not provide any defence that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with charges of hooliganism.'
However, telling the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said that he believed the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the US Department of Justice involve espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit online: "Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to the German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it happen".
Relations between the US and Germany have come under strain after claims that the NSA has bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel 's phone.
Thomas Operman, MP who chairs the parliamentary intelligence committee, said that if Mr Snowden had the opportunity to testify "without completely ruining relations with the United States and endangering them", then it should be taken.
Mr. Strauss Biele, a member of parliament for the Green Party of Germany, posted a picture of himself with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He said he was on his way to Russia with two German journalists.
Mr. Bestreau said that, according to a former NSA contractor lawyer, if they left Russia, the Snowden would not be able to return to Russia.
If Snowden testified in Germany he would be " safe " there, which would require assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he had been forced to leave his home because of "a terrible and continuous campaign".
He said however that the world was happy and overwhelmed by the widespread reactions "to his work of political expression".
The United States - including the world 's citizens - as well as high officials have condemned the revelation of an irresponsible system of widespread surveillance of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Frontier Airlines will charge for carry - on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 for carry - on storage for passengers on board their aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry - on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though on Wednesday it announced that passengers can keep the entire bag.
The new carry - on charge is for bags in the overhead bin, so, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 if passengers wait to pay until they're at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $ 100 fee is to get passengers to take care of the charge in advance.
"We don't want that charge", he said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid the fee are filling as much as they can in carry-on baggage which is stashed in the overhead compartment, which means this compartment often has less space.
There is a way to bring down the fees for passengers on board.
O 'Malley said this new charge isn 't really about raising money.
It's about Frontier's most loyal customers that finding a replacement for the overhead bin has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay it.
This means that the next person in line might pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in line at a border gate might get one bag for free.
O 'Malley said that Frontier's website and check in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before they reach the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee will not start until summer although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other charges, but the airline favors them.
They argue that luggage handling costs money, and passengers who want service should pay for it.
Many are seeing the baggage fee on Wall Street as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not even touched the carry - on bag fee though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first introduced the carry-on fee three years ago, and partner discount Allegiant Air later.
Another airline with such a fee is Hungary 's Wizz Air, which, says airline consultant Jay Sorensen, tracks the add-on fees.
He said that the Spirit 's carry-on fee brings in $ 50 million a year which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew in Spirit and was surprised that passengers had faced unusual carry-on bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I had seen in my airline career was seamless", he said.
I was hoping to grind my teeth and see a fight out at the gate.
"The plane was full and they climbed it lickety-split".
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The Frontier said that any passenger who wants to take soda or juice can keep the whole box, and it will give free coffee only once.
It'll still give away the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but after passengers complained seven months later they backed down and no other major airline followed after being there.
Frontier's move to charge carrier - on fees if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is its latest attempt to drive customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel vendor Orbitz between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
That is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier has moved further in this area, however.
In September, many frequent flights began to offer half-mile fares to customers who had purchased from these individuals at an online travel agency.
On Wednesday it reduced the mileage award by 25 per cent of the trip mile.
So, a 1,000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn you 250 miles.
It also allows the sole passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home town of Denver, but its business is dwindling and it's losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Trying to fix Frontier's finances as part of the Republic Airlines sale.
NSA blamed "internal error" rather than hackers for the website crash
The mysterious National Security Agency said on Friday that our website was down for a few hours due to some technical glitch, not hackers as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error during a predetermined update", the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved tonight.
It is not true that the interruption was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website had been down for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
An NSA spokesperson told ABC News that there was "absolutely no" agreement with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one hacker group has claimed online that they are responsible for the NSA website being disrupted by the DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to send traffic to the target website in such a way that the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unorthodox and attacks are not aimed at penetrating the internal network of the target system.
The formerly highly secretive NSA, once dubbed "no agency", has been the subject of much discussion and bitter criticism among the general public in recent months over the revelations of a large number of foreign and domestic spying programs - which came about after the collectively disgusted former NSA contractor Edward Snowden stole and disclosed secret NSA files from the agency.
Due to the growing controversy surrounding the agency, speculation was raised after the incident last night that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The beautiful expression was presented in line with the 'Another Dronacharya' plot, which shows harmony between the Dvapar era and the present situation.
It was shown in what conditions a guru is forced to follow the wrong path.
The drama was launched in the auditorium of St. Joseph Inter College by Chief Guest MLA Prabhu Deyal Valmiki, Deputy Chairman of the Chhawni Council Shipra Rastogi, Naresh Kansal and Shakti Singh jointly.
The play depicted the similarities between the circumstances of Dronacharya of the Dvapar era and a professor Arvind in the present.
In the drama directed by Anil Sharma, Bharat Bhushan Sharma, Anil Sharma, Vinod Bhattain, Hemant Goyal, Seema Samar, Vanshidhar Chaturvedi, Abid Sami, Shiva Ghazala, Amit, Ramesh, Arjun, etc. gave a great performance, doing justice to the characters.
The lighting in the play was done by the young painter Jitendra C. Raj and the set design by Hemant Kumar.
The ceremony was followed by the presentation of various awards to literary and cultural contributors from Aptha.
The stage was given to Dr. Aslam Jamshedpuri, Head of Urdu Department, Singh Vivi, Senior Journalist Shambhunath Shukla and Jitendra C. Raj, a colorist.
The Executive Officers, including Secretary Surendra Sharma, Rakesh Kaushik, Abid Rizvi, etc. contributed to the success of the event.
Bombardier 's profits decline as aircraft deliveries, orders fall
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in its rail unit in the third quarter and under pressure from aircraft orders and deliveries on contract issues.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or issue an update on whether the aircraft would complete its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service from next September.
After the test plane's first flight about a month and a half ago, it has only been flown three times, raising questions whether the test phase is on track.
The result fell below forecast and the stock has sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for a sliding of over 8 percent.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, had lowered his rating of the stock from "mat" to "area performance" on Thursday to limit the upward trend over the next quarter or two.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly expected, we are clearly disappointed by margin performance in transportation", Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it at the lower end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
Potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company 's claims about the new jetliner 's fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as for the CSeries the firm order is up to 177.
403 total orders and commitments available with 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Baudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet was put into commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and media on Thursday that the event was proceeding as scheduled.
"The test aircraft stayed on the ground longer than predicted", Baudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the plane's intermission.
Each manufacturer makes a different schedule.
We had decided to make a first flight and do an update period and said what we did.
That's why the flight program will be all through.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts believe the customer is skeptical that a CSeries aircraft could begin operations in the first 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier has said that it has evaluated the entry into service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow speed of flight testing - although in line with Bombardier 's internal schedule - confirms our view that entry into service will be pushed to Q1/15 , " Dorsen said .

New research has shown that we work with utmost honesty and dedication in the morning.
They do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening our minds change and we set aside the ideal and go against the rule.
In this research, researchers from Harvard University and the David Eccles School of Business in Utah have provided some interesting facts.
Researchers have found that while we tend to focus on moral values in the morning without the stress of work, we tend to lose integrity in the evening when we are tired or under pressure.
To do this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point was more to the left or to the right.
Participants were told that they would be paid if they gave wrong answers instead of correct ones.
The experiment showed that the people who were tested between 8 am and 12 am did not make any mistakes and gave the correct answer.
In the experiment, people between 12 noon and 6 pm were found to have given deliberately incorrect answers, keeping their principles in check.
This allowed researchers to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
The research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
After the robbery, the thugs fled, waving their hands.
The family members have admitted the injured person to hospital in critical condition.

Family and villagers who got to know about the incident took him to the hospital in Meerut in critical condition.
No report of the case had been registered as of the time of writing.
Three days ago, while returning home from the same bank, Ammanulapur resident Jasveer was shot and injured by two bikers.
Apart from these, the police has not been able to disclose many other recent cases.
Here, SO Sumer Singh Yadav claimed that the incidents would be disclosed soon.

Arrest of cocaine addict lawyer who gave Mr Big secret information about police investigation
42 year old Basharat Ditta used to inform the notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people might find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court.
The defence's top lawyer, who told Mr Big about the main police investigation because he feared people would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been jailed for three years.
After Barasht Ditta, 42, had settled for his cocaine addiction, he provided notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash", and hailed by criminals as a "top brief", was arrested in 2011 from his home in Scarborough following a police surveillance operation, which he had represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Officers spotted 32-year-old Scarborough carrying three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a law society dinner with his colleagues.
After detecting cocaine particles in Ditta 's hair, wallet, and credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of category A drugs.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, she illegally sought information from Scarborough and his associate about the arrest of two people.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of the main investigation into heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
It included 32 other people who were jailed after police seized heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million, and more than £200,000 in cash, during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals, fearing that his cocaine addiction would not be known.
Ditta, who works at the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was facing a failure at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstructing justice following a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had admitted to possession of cocaine at the previous hearing.
The lawyer's bad times began when, during the investigation of Scarborough, the police discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives chased the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta 's house and in the Black Golf Gloves holding a drug of more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer 's bin.
Scarborough was in regular contact on the phone with Ditta after the drug was placed, who had gone out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium, Ewood Park.
The lawyer arrived at the house and found that the drugs were stored there and there had been nine conversations between them.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test after traces of a class A drug were found on his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said their discussions were a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest Ditta tried to remove many credit cards by taking out his wallet, but they were seized, and his hair was sampled.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run his office from his workplace as well as from his home, and his clients used to call him at home for legal matters.
After the principal persons arrested had told what the spies knew about them, the court heard that Ditta used to call the heads of the drug supply chain, some of whom he had presented cases before.
Anne White, on behalf of the prosecution, said: "The criminal lawyer should know best about not breaking the law".
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, over-engaging with his particular client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the ordinary drug dealer, but about the dealer who is supplying drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been undoubtedly formal, for he was a lawyer.
But he went beyond his lawyer - client relationship.
He disrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting his profession, not honoring it.
He made very close contact with certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed the deal to go ahead of his free will.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "The moment Mr Ditta started getting drugs from organized criminals, he transformed himself from criminal lawyer to criminal".
His cocaine addiction made him highly compromised and very vulnerable to the aims of leading members of organized crime groups who used him to obtain important information related to police investigations.
Advocates should maintain the highest standards of honesty and instill trust and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has deceived himself with this belief and tried to escape in the guise of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit investigated Mr Ditta, finding him guilty of three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough was jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty - five other gang members were sentenced to prison for drug offences for a total of 153 years.
On her website, Ditta gave a Q&A session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for a death row client in the US, to be Muhammad Ali's dinner guest and to have inequality as an inspiration for her work.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying "It is a terrible place, and it is legitimate to ask: What is there to prevent the independence of the judiciary from being taken away by Parliament in the future?"
"This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it", said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group - the operator of Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website, CapitalFM.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, as it is an organ of the government" and said banning content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
He said, "I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send back MPs".
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill would give the government "strict control over the media", while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been "dealt a severe blow" and called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the attack by an Islamic gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media broadcast security camera footage of the squads sent to the attack site, showing them deliberately looting the mall, which angered officials in Kenyan media.
Police Chief David Kimiyono had sent summonses for questioning to two journalists and a media worker, although the summons was withdrawn after a media fuss.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 2 crore Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to 1 million Kenyan shillings, with the additional risk of "de-listing" or not being given official press recognition.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "a single earthstick is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations".
It also said that these measures could have a devastating impact on what is described as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do their own thing.
Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew writes that "no one will ever know", describing the Kenyan media as the main source of control and balance in public life.
He wrote, "Left to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and return us to the era of hunting and storing".
Kenyan lawmakers have faced public outrage in the past.
In May he voted to reject the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored the tax-free monthly wage of around 532,000 shillings, which is considered one of the highest in the world.
The birthday of the wife of the richest Indian in the world, Mukesh Ambani, is November 1, but as the clock struck twelve on the night of October 30, the whole of Jodhpur began to resonate with the birthday of Nita Ambani.
Earlier, the atmosphere of celebration was completely formed by the performance of the team of AR Rahman.
At the musical night which started at 8 pm, Rahman performed his signature songs.
Priyanka Chopra was on stage to give the beautiful colours of the dance.
About 32 charters arrived at Jodhpur for guests attending Nita Ambani's birthday.
Due to the lack of parking space at Jodhpur Airport, charter parks were opened in Jaipur, Delhi, Udaipur and Jodhpur.
Similarly, 135 luxury cars including BMW and Jaguar were ordered.
The city has a cleanliness system, street lighting has completely failed, he said.
No steps are being taken by the Municipal Corporation and HUDA to run the city centre of Panchkula.
He has demanded that the house tax be abolished completely from Panchkula.
Addressing a press conference here on Friday, VK Sood said that after the Municipal Corporation elections, the city has got new councillors and mayors, but they do not have the power to get the job done.
The city council has become a dummy and the officials are acting on their own accord.
The Municipal Corporation has crores of rupees but interest is being collected by depositing all the money in banks as FDs, Sood said.
But no steps are being taken to invest the money in the development of the city.
V. Suked said that the problem of doping grounds is the most serious.
Due to the construction of a doping ground in Sector 23, people living in the slum areas have been forced to live a hellish life for the past several years.
Municipal officials have been talking about shifting the doping ground in village Churiwala for the past several years, but the people of Barwala area are already getting into trouble with the serious problem of flies.
He said that the health services and education system in the villages have deteriorated.
No work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
The UN set new goals for fighting poverty
The United Nations is about to immediately begin work on a new set of goals, which will replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
The Australian diplomat played a key role in pushing the "Sustainable Development Goals" to replace the MDD, which expires in 2015, just ahead of the overnight Sustainable Development Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final draft of the document, which will be endorsed by world leaders including Ms Gillard during the summit.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time had come to "rise above national interests".
"I am very pleased that member countries have agreed to initiate and take ownership of the process to establish the Universal Sustainable Development Goals", he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development outline.
I will do my utmost to implement the mandate given to me by our member countries to fulfil our far-reaching objectives of Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns are growing as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambique's founding president, Samora, staring down at him, thousands gathered in central Maputo to chant for peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of an investment firm.
Fearing for her country's future, she changed her corporate uniform from a "We demand security" printed T-shirt in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks clashes between government troops and the RNMO have been reported almost daily, since a peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
René Nemo was once a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white - ruled Rhodesia and apartheid South Africa as part of the efforts to destabilize the country 's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent developments have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy. The exploration of the vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves of the Northwest could bring in investments of over $50bn next year from some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vale, Eni.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant political force since 1975, and RNMO blame each other for the tension.
Re Momo says the government started the latest struggle on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La Province, a traditional Re Momo stronghold.
As the attacks on former rebels intensified, government forces attacked Renmo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhaka, the group's leader, Fernando Majang, a spokesman for Renmo, the Financial Times reported.
The government blames Rame Namo for triggering the clash, accusing the soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Ghibouzan has sought to ignore concerns about instability.
Mr. Ghibouzhan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhaka saw himself as a "loser" "whatever remains for his forces to try to prove that he can impose his own decision on the government".
Both Free Limo and Ray Nemo insist they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mahang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace agreement was cancelled by Re Namo but has since become a matter of concern.
He told FT that means that the agreement is not being honored by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to the settlement talks, but seriously", Mr Maganga said.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing to ease the tensions of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men (Dhaka and Djibouti) fighting side by side", said Youssef Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambican expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor are they necessarily willing to make concessions of any kind.
Reimo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken of boycotting the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a morbid movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
Re Momo's share of the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Re Momo member of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), hopes to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr. Mahang says Mr. Jibuzhanko - who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the country 's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want to give up the presidency because he does not want peace, he does not want transparent elections", said Mr. Majang.
What kind of capability is the RNMO's has not been made clear, but it has made disruptive hit and run visits to police stations and vehicles on a major North South Highway.
Most of the clashes are centred several hundred kilometers north of Sofa La Meña, a province of Jomaputo, which hosts the port of Beira, which relies on coal exports, including the Rio Tinto and Valley mines.
In June, the Rio Railway suspended its operation for almost a week after threatening to attack the RNMO line.
When asked whether Renu Namo would be able to repeat this threat, Mr. Magangvinit was almost delighted.
"Things were not going well in Mozambique who wanted to alert the international community", Mr. Mahanga said.
The instability of the government has added to the chaos, says Fernando Lima, Media Cop, who heads an independent media company, many are also concerned about corruption, slow growth and the recent flood of kidnappings.
"The people responsible for the future of the country are the government and the president, and think that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems, " he says.
Omar Sultan, an exhibitor, people still want sustainability.
"Nobody cares about RNMO and free limo, they just want peace again, they want free access to the streets", he said.
Children should be taught "myths and legends as models for a way of life of the author.
Thor's stories could show "the subtle tricks of brute force are unsurpassed", while the Arthurian legends show the importance of having a dream.
To teach many of the myths were also "exceptionally far - reaching wild and in some cases even pornographic and would not be appropriate to teach in schools", Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the age - appropriate works "carefully selected".
"I find it astonishing that in America, myth and folklore are already a part of the education system", he said.
I've been advocating it as a plan for twenty years.
He has called writers and teachers "more educational" and this is "a new turn" for children, with messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and co-authored the book Penguin of Norwegian mythology and British folklore, said: "You can have many intentions but it is better to keep them out of sight".
Perhaps the biggest difference between writing an adult author for a child and writing an adult author for an adult is the need for some sense of hope.
Everything has to be simplified or come to a happy end, because it's an instinctive sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than being told through a story.
The old base is not showing.
Dialogue, Ghumarvi: Chief Constable Omprakash retired after 32 years of service in the Ghumarvi Police Department.
The police department staff and officers organised a farewell party on the occasion.

Ben Greenman: The New York Comedy Festival is celebrating its 10th year.
People might argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: About a hundred years ago, comedian Frank Faye, who served as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to people sitting in a crowd in an interactive way.
Fay's quest has expanded over the years, most recently at the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, which was conceived and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institute Caroline's, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
Hirsch says, "Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolinas, and became huge successes, to the point where they became too big to be played in clubs".
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes an appearance by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual musical and comedy benefit for military retirees at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes", which featured Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
As the festival has expanded, so has the world of comedy.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as shows coming on smaller networks like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll, who rose to prominence from the deep-cable sitcom (F.X.X. 's hilariously Ronchy fantasy - football themed "The League"), now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member on "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marshal the Shell with Shoes On".
Other young comedians with different voices, including Kroll and Slate (Anthony Jeselnik with a completely different, dispirited voice, satirical, ethnically - oriented W. Camow Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but has become a renowned television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will be held in the center of Manhattan, at the Town Hall.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work", Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he was here, he would sometimes walk down the street between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Oil continued to fall towards $ 96 per barrel
The continued decline in oil prices is offset by a report on Friday showing concerns over over-supply as China 's power-hungry manufacturing sector strengthens.
The benchmark for December delivery was 14 cents down at $ 96.24 per barrel in Europe by late morning in electronic trading at the American Crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract is down 5.8 percent for the month of October, dropping 39 cents on Thursday.
The adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that US supply has increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the supply has increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But a strong demand suggestion of a surge in activity has been revealed by two reports on sugar manufacturing coming out on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China 's economic recovery after having been low-key in the third quarter for over two decades at 7.8 percent in the previous quarter .
Brent crude, also a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refiners, fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
The court has blocked action on the NYPD's pause and sports policy.
On Thursday a federal appeals court blocked changes to the New York Police Department's break and sports program requiring a judge's order and removed the judge from the case.
Judge Shira Schindler of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2nd said the judge's decision will be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in Nagar had ruled in August that it violated the constitution by preventing people and excluding them from its program of interrogation.
The city police department has appealed its decision to allocate a monitoring to help in the change of its policy and the associated training program, including its findings and its remedial order.
The appeal court heard arguments on the requested migration on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal has held that because he misrepresented the need for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in part of a series of media interviews and deviated from the US Code of Conduct for Judges by the public, the judge should therefore be removed from the case, statements that criticize the court should be publicly held accountable.
The judge ruled that police officers had wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pauses and sports program.
It has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and it has ordered a pilot program to test body - worn cameras in some of the campuses where closures are most common.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after 14 March 2014.
The pause and play tactic has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The recess and sports policy has been around for decades in some form, but has slowed dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, from 684,330 mostly black and Hispanic men, to an all-time high in 2011.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men all minorities and became a class action case.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's breaks and sports program have said that the end of inappropriate behavior will create a more reliable and effective police force and may influence the use of other police department policies.
Opponents say the change will reduce police morale, but will solve a widespread problem of crime, money laundering and not a police force under pressure after being shrunk by thousands of officers over the past decade.
The judge has noted that the termination for breaks and play was not made, which is constitutional, but improved the NYPD's implementation of the stop.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chhatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven days, all the participants were briefed on various subjects including tent pitching, flag polls.
The training mandate is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Roy and Isha Ghosh.
By participating in the prayers, all the participants are spreading a sense of unity.
The State Training Commissioner, Vipin Kumar is providing special assistance.
Coulson used phone hacking to verify classified information
Andy Coulson, a former editor of News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face contact" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about Charles Clark's affairs while he was Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC told the Old Bailey that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polley.
The newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Polby 's voicemail and "watch" the male, but Coulson called and left his voicemail, the court said.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NOTW, is not known for standing outside people's houses and watching them, but rather he puts the article in front of people, seeing how people react to it", said Mr. Addis.
He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third group included the editors themselves.
He obviously knew about the other ways of doing things, he certainly did.
What about the first?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
They say, "No, we say, "Yes, he certainly knew".
The rumor about Clark's affair was first brought up by the A.O.T.W. feature desk at the time when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
In August 2006 from Mulcaire's home, voice mail tapes were seized from Ms. Paulby's phone at least three times.
Investigators also found entries in the private investigator's computer that named Ms. Paulby and her sister as "Project".
During the period of her investigation, Ms. Paulby's grandparents were called anonymously for information about her.
During this time, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Paulby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson told him via a voice mail: "I've got a story we're planning to run tomorrow, which I'd definitely like to talk to Charles about".
Mr. Addis said that Coulson's involvement in the case is in the same vein as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blankett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Coulson had talked to Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he was looking into the case of co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks refused to compromise with others to hack phones between October 3, 200 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlback and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
The NSA 's revelations about state surveillance have fueled corporate fear.
On a quiet day late in August, a German police helicopter roared over the American consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
The mission, under the direction of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency, was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media asked the BfV to express hope for identifying the presence of the listening antenna and hinted at an exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of US national intelligence, stressed that the US would not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal foreign companies' trade secrets and to increase American companies' international competitiveness or their bottom line" again in September.
But since Edward Snowden, a contractor turned whistleblower, began to reveal his treasure trove of secrets to American surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure that the director is not willing to keep his word.
The US National Security Agency reported on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears of state surveillance.
The final blow came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, probably a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful people can be targeted, surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the deep cooperation between US intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible to use this data for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up", says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published in July by German company consultancy, the US is now almost as much a risk as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documents leaked by Mr Snowden, however, there is to date no evidence that the US has known the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern about the EU's lack of internet capabilities, and that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly...
"There is no way", said Hasso Platner, president of the German business software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn't have let it die 20 years ago.
In Germany, everything is subsidized, from coal to cars to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Snowden's revelations about American technological sophistication and access to intelligence have proved a shock to some companies that previously believed the greatest surveillance threat was China.
There is a big shift in the cloud computing space where European officials are more aware that data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and therefore potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by Cloud Security Alliance, a business organization, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US based cloud provider after revelations about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snape, co-CEO of SAP, says: "We've seen a new question that customers didn't get a year ago -- that is, where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are merely confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and data and therefore should guard them at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
It always has.
"This has been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing has changed", says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we do, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in defense and it is an advantage to the attacker.
For large companies, it's been a long time since texting has been a pointless thing whether it's leaving a business at home with a USB stick, or leaving a laptop homeless in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member of the car manufacturer Audi, says that it's a very old system to collect cell phones before board meetings because they can't be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones while smartphones are compromised due to the risk on trips abroad.
Prepaid mobile phones were then thrown away later.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, it is several companies leading the global market in a particular space.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access", the BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned of economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to France The Washington Post in February US national intelligence named Russia and Israel in the second tier of criminals involved in hacking economic information, which is behind China.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in an interview: "The services know very well that all countries, even if they join the non - terrorist war, spy on their allies. "
The Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level, and we do, because it is in the national interest to protect our business.
No one was fooled.
Parents of a Georgia teenager killed in "a strange accident" believe their son was murdered
A Georgia teenager whose body was found wrapped in a wrestling mat in her high school gym believes her son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, GA was found trapped in a straight mat behind bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Lowndes County Sheriff 's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a "strange accident", but the 17-year-old boy 's family denied this.
Benjamin Crump, the attorney who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he firmly believes that his son has been murdered".
They have no faith in death in the way the sheriff has told them.
"He believes this is beyond the laws of physics and reasoning of common sense", said Crump.
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
He said, "He sent his son to school with a book-back, and he came back in a body bag".
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mulwray said Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that many important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered for a crime?
He made the remarks at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they lead us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
He said, "I think there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation".
Moore told reporters that preliminary autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of "positional respiratory arrest".
According to Moore, however, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death".
He said, "There are many questions that need to be answered or confirmed".
Moore also said that if he finds enough evidence to call a criminal or civil rights investigation into Johnson 's death, he will ask the FBI to do it.
When contacted on Thursday, the representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not immediately available for comment.
On Wednesday, a judge in south Georgia ordered officials to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.
CDC issues guidelines on children's allergies for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling food allergies in school children.
The guidelines are the first to be issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that food allergy cases among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about food allergies in children and how to handle any allergic reaction.
Schools have also been advised to stockpile epinephrine - the most commonly used auto-injector of the epinephrine brand - to combat potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The State Legislature has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily stock up on epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I feel like something is poking my tongue", "I feel like I have hair on my tongue", or "My tongue is tingling".
Parents of intersex children can choose their children's gender undefined
Germany has become the first EU country to recognise the third gender for children born with vaginal discharge.
The newborn will no longer be classified as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to declare the gender for such children, this law allows them to declare the gender "unspecified" or "unspecified" on the child 's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who can make early decisions regarding gender-specific surgery for newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later, "I'm neither male nor female".
I will remain a scarred, scarred vessel made by the doctors.
It is estimated that every year, one child in 2,000 is born neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that fall under the scope of the examination of sexual development disorders, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitalia (ovaries or testicles), or abnormally developed sex.
Maybe Wallace Simpson was intersex.
Gender identity is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender - determination is not possible, it is better to use the best available information to specify gender and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before conducting surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in gender-identification issues, said that Germany's new law "seems like a good thing".
Intersex children create moral discord.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don't", he said.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of how a sex will develop in a child is not very precise.
No one can give a good answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle as to why people are gay.
A report filed with the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not related to gender but to their biological makeup, which is neither explicitly male nor explicitly female but either a combination of both or neither is explicitly defined.
These traits may manifest themselves in secondary sex characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; in primary sex characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the employment field, as well as harassment, violence and bias crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non - conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult persons to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Norrie May-Welby of Australia became the world's first recognised "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal to retain "unspecified" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passport will have a third specification as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial in neighboring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to have "gender theory" removed from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, saying, "As the world moves to a state where gender is a choice, but not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in opposite directions".
A mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would like to see her children assigned a gender at birth.
They say on the website about parenting, "It's very stressful to be a parent without any extra boundaries, especially if you don't even know what your child's gender is".
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bi - sex), named after the beautiful Greek goddess who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world thought of sex as a slate that could be erased and rewritten.
But many people are now challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender identification is a complex task, and sometimes it can even be mistaken by doctors who do not know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called the 'psychiatric emergency,'" Dresser says.
When these babies were born, you didn't call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory about the treatment of children with vaginal discharge was put forward by Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was verifiable.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues - how parents raise a child - interact with the child's genes and hormones to determine whether it is identified as male or female.
But in a case of 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had been accidentally dislocated during a circumcision to have the child completely bound and have his testicles removed and to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented that case as a successful case of stagnation, but it didn't happen", Dresser said.
At the age of 15, the boy changed back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Dresser said that some practitioners are still "following the same pattern".
But with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s, individuals who had undergone these gender surgeries began to come forward "not happy with the results".
Such was the case with 36 - year - old Montana author Jim Bruce, who was born with the XY male chromosome but had a vaginal discharge.
The doctors clearly did not understand whether his penis was small, or his scrotum was large, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So in 1976, shortly after his birth, Bruce had his external organs and testicles removed by surgery and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl".
I was not happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was going to have a vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and confused, she demanded medical records.
This revealed to him the terrible truth.
I was confined at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and had his breasts removed.
The surgery left him barren.
Today, he is at an organization called Interface Project to help people normalize their perceptions of intersex people.
But Annie Tamer-Matis, the managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that German law "invites chippie and stigma".
"Many activists feel that the German law will encourage parents to make quick decisions and to designate a child 'indefinite,'" she says.
We fear that this will encourage intervention.
We think that rather than waiting, it is a better process to specify the gender.
But we do not know how the law will play its part, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Matisse said her organization supports the Australian law because "it allows adults to be identified in the third gender".
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender", he said.
The German law concerns the specification of it at birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
As adults, they can make their own decisions about their bodies.
But Dr. Erlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh breast radiologist whose daughter has sexual developmental disorder, and who assists hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany's law would "empower both parents and children".
Baratzi's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she had a D.S.D. called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Since she had a defect in the androgen receptor, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is barren, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents to avoid making hasty decisions on their own", said Baraj.
This gives them time to understand and to pass some tests before writing 'man' or 'woman'.
That way, you stay healthy - raise the child, love the child.
You have a sweet baby and enjoy it.
We don't need to rush into surgery that can't be reversed.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the confusion that motivates them to not believe they're doing well", he said.
Eventually, the child will determine which gender he is most comfortable with -- and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
The Legal Awareness Camp was held at the Middle School Dalher, Ramanagar, on behalf of the Tehsil Legal Services Committee Ramanagar, chaired by the Chairman of the Committee and the Sub-Justice of Ramanagar, Mr. Sandeep Kaur.
The students and others were informed about the right to education and the law for the economically backward.
Advocates ML Gupta, Rohin Bharadwaj and Sarpanch spoke at the camp and made people aware of the issue.
A large number of villagers were present at the event.
Report: Biden is dumping Obama on Hillary Clinton for the campaign.
According to the New York Times, close advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Biden as Vice President with Hillary Clinton for the 2012 ticket.
The most notable blast in the revelation is the highly anticipated 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Hellmann, Tom, "Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the forthcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "wide group sessions and polls in late 2011" to find out what dumping Biden could help in Obama's declining re-election hopes.
According to Times national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the campaign efforts of key officials and former White House chief of staff Bill Haley to name the White House, to find out what effect the change of former Secretary of State Clinton from vice president had on the polls.
The potential switch was a highly secure secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago operation and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisers - including former Obama campaign chief Jim Massena, and former White House senior advisers David Oxlerrod and David Paluffe - knew the change was under consideration.
Double Down claims that Mr. Dalé tried to change Mr. Biden despite his personal alignment before finally deciding when his information was telling him that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dahl confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
"I said with the whole scene in mind, and one of them was this", Dahl told the newspaper.
Remember, at that time, the presidency was in jeopardy, so we were in a situation where we were like, "Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?"
While Dale described the research as "cautious", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested significantly in finding out how much the claim would yield in the polls.
"Campaign money doesn't spend on voting and focus groups unless they're seriously considering something", Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about the potential change.
While Dahl said he "didn't think the president knew about the potential change", the former chief of staff believed it was "possible" that Obama knew.
"Double Down" definitely won't answer whether the political investigation got to Obama's desk, Martin added.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama Biden was unaware of the dumping ticket investigation.
"Perhaps", said Martin.
Like the glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
He came up with the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to use chemical glow to re-glow proteins.
Ice cream, by reacting with the eater's tongue, will raise the protein pH level and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream lights up by reacting to the heat in your mouth, so the more you lick, the more it lights up.
Charlie, founder of the company Lik Me I'm Delicious Ice Cream, said: "It's unbelievable, but the initial production of £200 would be about two grams of stuff".
The protein we're using in ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the protein will increase the pH level and the ice cream will glow.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seems perfect to share on Halloween because it gives a wonderful glow effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the glitter of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me about 140 pounds.
The iska is very good, though.
Charlie's Bristol - based experimental company is renowned for its unusual flavours including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next work is going to be even more ambitious.
He said, "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream".
That's obviously impossible because of the ice crystals that create refraction on top of the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is a useful fluorescent property of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.
The entire market was crowded with customers in Rani Bagh Market.
It was the case that people had to wait 15 to 20 minutes to buy the pottery.
The same was true in Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market and Central Market at Prashant Vihar.
A similar sight was seen at the supermarkets of Pithampura, Ashok Vihar, and Model Town.
Here too, people bought gold and silver jewellery and coins.
This also caused traffic jams in other markets including the Outer Ring Road.
However, people who left the office to go home had to spend hours in traffic jams to get home.
Halloween 2013: by Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I'm more than a greedy man.
I haven't even signed up to give out candy from my apartment for the last two years and probably won't this year.
But the statistics show that I'm a black sheep when Halloween comes.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans will actually spend $158 million this year on Halloween, $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always noticed is the Halloween trends.
According to NRF, out of the total expenditure of $6.9 billion, the cost of clothing is estimated at $1.2 billion.
This year sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women don't have to prostitute themselves because they're sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots.
For men, I hope that many zombies, and thank you walking dead, will create our Instagram feeds for space men this year.
According to Google, the most searched outfits will be zombies, Batman, bandits and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dogs, and surprisingly we weren't alone.
According to NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet clothes.
Ironically, there are a lot of hot dogs with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't look around.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen Company.
Hairy bars, lollipops, milk duds, twisters and clark bars are worth around £600 million.
It is good news, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, that 41 million Trick-or-Trick are about to participate in our neighborhood.
But in fact, we, and those who are joking, are going to buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
One thing we won't be using for Halloween, according to the Confectioners' Association, is candycorn, but that too will sell for about 35 million pounds.
That's the individual bundle of corn about 9 billion.
It's a mystery yet to be solved
Nothing more metaphysical than a Halloween haunted house.
They're best known as, "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is, in fact, a prison), "Shout-O-Shout" and "House of Shock".
In fact, according to the American government, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million in revenue. And the awesome photos your friend posts on Facebook and the guy who likes and comments on you. Nice Face.
Finally, let 's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o'-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree -- it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, there was a "baby in a pumpkin" trend that started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards rather than being obsessed with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack-O's slowly sinking lantern on his front porch, probably from Illinois, which this year grew by 542 million pounds of pumpkin.
If you 're looking for extra credit, try to phone Tim and Susan Matisado in Napa, Calif., and engrave their 2,032 pound pumpkin above.
The MCA said in a statement, "It was decided that a postmark be issued with a picture of Sachin during the presentation before the start of the match.
This will be followed by a joint presentation by the BCCI and the MCA.
In addition, a special coin will be used for the toss which will be handled by the MCA.
The MCA will also release a 64 page brochure containing articles related to Tendulkar and statements about him from the business, sports and journalism world.
The limited number of the brochures and coins will be distributed to the members of the MCA and BCCI, the association said.
He said that 10,000 masks, 10,000 score cards and 10,000 hats with pictures of Sachin will be distributed every day.
Land Rover rally series announced
It has racing seats in the interior and has a six - point harness belt, as well as an intercom system.
Its options include - upgraded brakes, service packages that provide access to Ballor Works mechanics, logistics support, and vehicle collection between events.
"The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed", said Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport.
They are not all experienced racers, but rather people looking for the excitement and the direction of world-class events.
We are delighted to offer this route in partnership with Land Roller and MSA, and we believe this format provides a new way to experience different rally styles in the UK and overseas, and prepares the competitor for the rigors and authenticity of rally racing.
We've really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car - it's going to be a really fun championship.
In addition, Defender Challenger will provide the option of training and testing days in February as well as competing in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
The dream of the fireworks traders of doing business in the fireworks market in the transport area did not come true.
The fireworks traders are stuck in the mud after the High Court order.
Neither can they trade in the temporary fireworks market set up at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued a licence for trading in the transport area.
The Commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary fireworks market at Ranjith Avenue unsafe during its visit.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs.
The High Court in its order has sharply rebuked the administrative authorities of Amritsar, saying that what is the function of an administration that for nine years could not solve a single problem of the firecrackers traders.
They could not be given proper accommodation in the city.
After this, the fireworks traders were asked to issue licenses for trading in the market at Shivgarh by providing proper security.
Although the fireworks traders were happy with the order, the police turned the water on Friday.
A team from the real licensing branch of the police reached the fireworks market and set up a counter there to sell the farm.
The conditions that were then laid down to them were impossible to fulfil in one day.
Anup Kumar, ACP East Gaurav Garg, Incharged of Aslaha License Branch, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma arrived at the fireworks market.
He expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements made by the fireworks traders.
Therefore, no licenses were issued to the fireworks traders.
Diwali is one day away.
This is causing problems for the fireworks traders.
They are losing crores of rupees.
Firecracker businessmen Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Duva, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say that if they suffered a loss of crores of rupees, they will sue the district administration.
Angry fireworks traders marched from Shivgarh to Ranjith Avenue on Friday night.
He chanted against the police and the district administration.
After this, the temporary fireworks market in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.
A fire brigade was called in to rescue a lost puppy on a treacherous mountain slope 50 feet above the ground in a mine.
The Cocker Spaniel Ruby had escaped after a minor road collision.
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in a mine.
Firefighters lowered the front of the rock by rope to save the dog from death
After being somehow trapped by Puppy on the face of a dangerous mountain 50 feet above the ground, he was given a lucky life by the call of the firefighters.
The nine-month-old cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, Denholm, were at the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After his escape after a minor accident, he searched frantically for his lost dog, and appeals were posted on social networking sites.
At 2.15pm on Wednesday, a keen-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby, 50 feet above the ground, on the hill in the mine.
A technical rescue team from Clackheaton Fire Station arrived at the scene and lowered Ruby by rope to save her and used a belly tube to bring her down the cliff.
Specialist Technical Rescue Officer Andy Clayton said: "She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front of the rock, 50 feet from top to bottom.
She did not move during the defence, she remained a stone.
But now she is well.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was a most unusual cry for help.
It is incredible to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby is lucky to survive".
He was likely to be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be fine, apart from fatigue and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to watch the rescue work"
At first I could not believe how she got there.
It is amazing to have her back in my hands.
The vet said that if she got too tired and fell, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a very good job.
What they did was really very brave.
We are grateful to them, and they were all excellent.
Mr. Elderson of Keighley also said: "We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there".
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can 't believe how she got there.
Mick Jagger says that when Katy Perry was 18, he didn't hit her.
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, the Pun Star said that he sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said he had dinner with the senior rocker, and "when I was 18, he hit me".
He said, "It's old school, and they're good to me".
Jagger, 70,'s representative said in a statement Thursday that he "clearly denies ever hitting Katy Perry".
The representative also said: "Perhaps Parry is misunderstanding someone else's saying about them".
Parry was one of the singers to guest on Rolling Stone 's tour this year.
His new album "Prism" reached the top spot this week.
The break-up of the euro gave the Scots a choice
Another day, another story of freedom's fear
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will be required to join as a free travel zone across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control at Berwick and the beads on Hadrian's walls suggest stories about the boundaries of the wire.
True, the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it did not make headlines.
Nor did anyone describe how EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules to suit their needs.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brussels will have a cheap discount for continued non-compliance in return for getting what it really wants from Scotland.
So, again, the non-story.
The first time I heard the baseless story "Freedom means passport control" was about 40 years ago.
Yet the point of interest is lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why trade the yoke of London for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: The great post-war plan to organize Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Parties across the EU are gaining strength to oppose the EU or to stop the euro as the single currency.
Even in Germany the Eurosceptical Alternative for Germany party - which was founded just this year - suddenly came out and won almost half a million votes in the federal election of September, thus effectively eliminating the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But the present economic crisis proved to be a radical change.
With the stringent regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, along with the constraints imposed on national economies through complying with the single currency, many people are having to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play much of a role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system allowed its members to stabilize the exchange rate in favour of German exporters - something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself in a position with an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public expenditure - which Berlin has encouraged.
Beyond the current budget and monetary problems lies the deep European productivity malaise.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - to provide concessions to French and German energy firms at the expense of consumers - European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United Nations.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even a freeze on all wages in the world cannot save the European petrochemical industry from being hit by cheap US shale gas.
The result is a sense of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a major supporter of the EU.
After the war, France 's top politicians saw the EU as a means of keeping Germany in check, and Paris as a means of providing the world with Washington 's equivalent in billing.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as its passport for political legitimacy, and it has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, which are causing France's economy to stumble.
Results: The right-wing, anti-EU National Front of Marine Le Pen has won the recent by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote - a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot proceed on the assumption that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his newfound fame amongst French white, working class people?
The party wants to use the EU elections next year to create an anti - EU, anti - currency faction in the European Parliament.
If, as is very likely, anti-EU parties do well in these elections, this type of faction could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: The convergence of anti-EU and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will soon bring an end to the euro.
The euro will not disappear completely, but it will break up and return to some form of "Europe of sovereign nations" supported by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its successor economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the UK to keep itself away from this project in the hope of closer ties with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all these?
We can choose to remain in Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-union nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence by following the path of Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland has - remarkably - been the most successful anti - austerity political campaign in Europe, winning a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of opposition to the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory - Lib Dems coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, because in that case it would have to accept the austerity rules imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Premature puberty: growing up early
Research shows that African - American and Hispanic girls reach puberty earlier than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near.
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed.
Experts believe that obesity may be a cause of early puberty.
Premature puberty is less effective in boys.
Pat Ethridge, a former CNN correspondent, is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be concerned if her daughter starts developing breasts and developing genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida, this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes, which are common among American girls, represent a new trend.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents", says Kaplowitz, "that it usually does not indicate rapid progress toward full puberty".
Direct signs of development such as breast germination, genital and pelvic hair and body odor are showing up prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been very little change in the age of Rajosadhar (first menstrual period).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"It takes at least two to three years for the first menopause to occur when the breasts begin to develop", explains Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Premature Puberty in Girls: An Essential Guide to Coping With This Common Problem.
The most accurate test of puberty is the time of puberty.
There is debate about what puberty is, but when breast development begins before the age of eight, two call it "child - adulthood".
In most cases the process will slow down or stop - which the pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of more rapid progression, examination by an endocrinologist may be required to eliminate the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can lead to underdeveloped growth and stunted growth as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the age of the child, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
The psychological aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is aware of drugs but admits, "Repressing adolescents can exacerbate behavioral issues, and girls may start to feel isolated from their peers".
The second big problem can be understood: Parents simply do not want their young daughter to have a period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they're going to maintain hygiene", said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock", recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs of this and we had also talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She returned from school frightened and upset that she had been the first of her classmates to have her period.
There are many well - known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
Yet, there is no consistent evidence to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexist messages in the media.
Boys are also - just like girls - reaching premature puberty.
Kaplowitz establishes the rule that the most important cause is the onset of obesity.
He helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 in 2001 which linked body fat to the time of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute.
In this country, African - American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty seems to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and gender.
Other puzzles: Although boys are acquiring facial and genital hair at an early age, the full course of puberty is not as clear as in girls.
Other practitioners present at the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
It is common to see hair on the mouth and genitals even in infants and children.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty", says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goribe Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician for an opinion on how to talk to their children.
"It could mean negotiating ahead of schedule", Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm, your child will usually answer correctly.
Premature development girls need to be reassured that even if it is premature, it is part of normal life.
The temperature dropped by 3.1 degrees Celsius on Thursday.
The rain and cold wind on Wednesday night made people feel very cold.
On Thursday, people wore sweaters and headed to the markets and their destinations.
The people have also taken out the rains when the first rains of winter come.
In the morning, people were seen enjoying the sun.
The weather changes and the cold will be relieved, but the sunshine continues due to the cloudiness of the day.
The children also arrived at their schools wearing sweaters.
The Air Force Meteorological Department said that the maximum temperature on Thursday was 25.1 degrees Celsius and the minimum temperature was 13.7 degrees Celsius.
While 7.8 millimeters of rainfall was recorded.
According to the weather department, cloud cover will continue.
Large orders from jet manufacturers at stake from disputes over seat width.
A battle has broken out for the Dubai Airshow of this month, setting the pace for a fight between the leading aircraft manufacturers for tourist-class seat widths for long-haul flights.
The controversy centers on the width of the economy class seats on long - haul aircraft, not always as offered by airlines but whose allocation efficiency is claimed by the latest jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company to be key.
Airbus is hoping to deliver an industry standard with at least 18 inches (46 cm) of width in the economy cabin this week, but that should be decided by airlines, its main rival Boeing says.
The dispute between the aircraft manufacturers comes after the 17-21 incident, when a potential order for a larger twin-engine version of the long-range aircraft was sold.
How is the rear compartment of the aircraft constructed - especially whether the seating is equal to 9 or 10 - the designs of mini jumbo jets are being developed keeping in mind the claims of greater capacity.
Boeing says it has built the 777 X that will seat 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in the Economics department.
Airbus says that it will carry 350 people in 18 inches left and 9 inches left.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, with Airbus 777 X expected to dominate over 100 orders at Dubai Airshow, it is appealing to the public further.
It seems that the recent start of the war of independence is something that is showing Fincero that the three of us in a restaurant together, would you accept it?
"Boeing is offering longer range flights in narrow seats, even from regional turbos", said John Leahy, Airbus head of sales.
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way they sit on planes hasn't changed.
According to U.S. Department of Health data, in the mid-1970s, when the Boeing 747 Jumbo introduced modern long-distance travel, the average 40- to 49-year-old American male weight increased by 10 percent.
According to the American Health Statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waistline of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to the 1950s one seat concept when the new name "jet set" was narrow in average circumference.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an extra inch in seat width to improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus 's seat measurement statistics, saying it was not up to the manufacturers to decide how the airline balances between rent and amenities.
Also, research shows that the width of a seat depends more on the experience of the cabin.
"It really speaks to the flexibility that airlines have in providing things that they believe they need to do to succeed", said Kent Krauer, a Boeing cabin expert.
"They don't want to tell us what they're getting out of it".
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it is about the elbow room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade behind the dispute is estimated to be at least $700 billion, enough to tip the scales of US and European exports in the coming decades.
Reuters reported for the first time in July, whether seat layout is really a battle issue among new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent efficiency per seat in their new twin engine design compared to the segment leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
Boeing's claim to performance depends on the 10's 777 X One compared to the original 9's 777 design.
10 equal to gain in unit cost has now come into use.
Kevin Kenniston, Head of Airbus Passenger Facility for Europe says "Boeing is doing it to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats ".
On the other hand, analysts say the full 10-seat-per-row cabin for the existing 777 S suggests that many passengers are in favour of a denser layout, which can also be accompanied by cheaper fares.
"The 18-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of the Airbus proposal is driven by the threat of the 777", said Mary Kirby, cabin interior expert and founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Jet dealers around the world should also take careful measures to check on this layout competition.
More relaxed, all the builders are also offering high density layouts of jet planes for low cost air services and regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but say it is not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus emphasized wider cabin seats on some of its jets for the need for more cabin comfort.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly to a new industry standard without support from other manufacturers, but it could distract from the 777 X sales wave.
New anti-nicotine vaccine may end the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti - nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which could take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the amniocentesis signals are positive.
"We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market today, but who have found that their nicotine addiction is far more potent than these existing methods", said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which is designed to transmit genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a permanent stream of antibodies.
The antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the smoker from developing a craving for nicotine by inactivating them before they reach the brain.
In the trial, the vaccinated mice who were later given nicotine continued their normal activities.
But the unvaccinated mouse, the researchers say, "felt better", a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
It had to be administered at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but it proved expensive and impractical.
But the new vaccine is expected to be expensive, as the liver will turn the cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, thus saving them from nicotine addiction.
But it is likely to be used by smoking individuals to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again they will not get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them to quit", he said.
British scientists described the results as interesting but warned of the need for much more research.
Even after the post - mortem, the real cause of death of the tiger could not be revealed.
The Forest Department has been giving a rounded response, first describing the death of the tiger as natural.
On Thursday night, forest personnel of Ramnagar Forest Division found the body of a tiger near the Khichdi drainage of the Pavalgarh Conservation Reserve.
The tiger 's body was intact and there were no wounds or injuries.
The postmortem of the tiger was conducted by Bharat, CTR veterinarian and Hema Rathore, Kottabad veterinarian in the presence of Forest Conservationist Vivek Pandey, Deputy Director of CTR Saket Badola, DFO Khaksha Naseem, SDO GS Karki on Friday.
According to sources, the tiger's internal remains were reportedly damaged during the postmortem.
This did not reveal the actual cause of death of the tigers.
The departmental officers were giving a loud reply on the death of the tiger.
However, the tiger's internal organs have been sent to the IVRIs for topological examination to confirm the poison.
The forest conservationist Western Circle Vivek Pandey said that the death of the tiger can be considered as natural.
No signs of poisoning etc. have been found from the tiger's body.
However, the surrounding area is being searched and the BISRA is sending a probe to confirm the poison.
Tripod denies being influenced by Obid.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joye Tripodi will be investigated by the State Corruption Watch Dog.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody has refused to dismiss the policy on seaborne leases at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obid, a patron of former New South Wales who had a vested interest in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed an investigation into whether Mr. Obaid lobbied several state ministers for violations of the leases policy circulars whereby two restaurants and cafes owned by Obaid, were renewed without tender after their term expired in August 2005.
The allegation that Mr. Tripody knew Mr. Obaid's hidden interests is now being investigated after evidence was given by Lynn Ashpole, former Deputy Chief of Staff, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions in 2005, the government had pushed for the launch of public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against this and they wanted more time.
In 2009 the leases for the circular enterprises, which earned Obayd $ 2.5 million a year, were renewed by tender without leases.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of public tender.
But he refused to change the request of Mr. Obayid, who had urged a change in the government 's lease policy.
Transcript of a phone call presented to ICAC in August and September 2007 by Mr. Obayid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to Mr. Obayid's Fisheries Department after working in the Ports Ministry.
Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of commercial lease policy discussed in the telephone conversation of the case?"
"No", answered Mr. Tripod.
I can 't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn 't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obaid.
Officials say Israeli fighter jets have raided Syria.
Israeli fighter jets targeted the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
The officer did not say what the purpose was, but there must have been at least one purpose.
The Associated Press reports that the target was a Russian SA-125 missile.
Israel has already launched missile strikes inside Syria at least twice this year.
Foreign workers on 457 visa can pass "authentication" test
A "authentication" test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government as it aims to extend a strict procedure.
If adopted, the test will be implemented through a standard designed to prevent 457s being used to fill unskilled positions or to disguise themselves to family and friends in Australia.
A government discussion paper was released today, condemning the government's slur on foreign workers, with former Labour MP Maxine McQua today saying it could anger Australia's neighbours.
He told the America India Institute today that "foreigners are coming to the end of the queue" and the loud rhetoric about "Australians get jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions have been demanding a secure labour market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the region saw echoes of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on people smuggling, has implemented five proposed changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be checked as to "whether the nomination is true in circumstances where the nominee is the employer or relative or personal partner of the person sponsoring the visa".
Businesses may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as earlier businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's troubled nine - year - old son had come to Australia with him on a trip, and after his father died on Wednesday, his adult cousin, who was on the same ship, has taken over.
Australian authorities transported the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study has been announced by the UK Government to increase the benefits to Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 point to high speed services in Scotland and the north of England, which will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Cramer said the project would "bring Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "very excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the second stage is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the cost of building the high speed link between London and northern England from £ 32.7 billion to £ 42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was in talks with Scottish Transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibilities of further improving rail capacity and travel time for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Cramer: "Our goal for HS2 is a real national network, one that will bring the UK and its cities closer together".
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be enormous.
Without it, we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about connectivity of 18 UK cities including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected due to HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland".
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "High speed rail is likely to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland but it will also add to the economic burden on Scotland in the whole matter of high speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring high speed rail to Scotland, create benefits for all and complement the Glasgow - Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the report of the inquiry with British government ministers next year and to jointly deciding on further action.
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Despite the easing of equipment regulations in the US, Australian air passengers will continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open for US airline carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight, provided that those devices are in "airplane" mode.
Passengers can do this during many flights right now, but many people don 't like being unable to access their e - books etc. when they board and land.
Australian airlines are considering a decision that US airlines will have to do a lot to meet this requirement, but have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment in critical flight phases were still in effect in Australia.
"Currently, CASA does not have any specific regulations governing the use of electrical equipment on board aircraft", the authority said, "This issue falls under the regulations that require airline operators to ensure that safety is always in full swing and that passengers comply with safety instructions given by crew members".
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is willing to comply with the change, but has said it will take further action at the regulator's direction.
"We would welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, as we really feel it will provide a better experience for customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft", the spokesperson said.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules.
It said that "according to our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change this".
FAA decisions apply to American airlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will be different for each US airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline companies will need to certify that their aircraft can withstand radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their rule booklets, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and passenger briefing.
The FAA said that "after verification of the airline's aircraft's airworthiness, it will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electrical devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes".
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment during the aircraft landing.
The group also suggested that heavy equipment be safely placed under the seat or in the upper compartment during take-off and landing.
Ponzi brokers silver as middle class in Singapore feel the hardship
Aamirthalinga, a nanny at a pawnshop at the Bendmeyer Shopping Centre in Singapore, is cashing in her gold bra, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter 's school fees.
"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it", said Mrs. Amarthalinga.
She says that although she earns S$3,000 (US$2,400) as an administrator, and her husband also has a job, the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is rising - where ValueMax is trading, becoming the third pawnshop to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Jewelry mortgages are not the only way to get cash - in Ms. Amarthalinga's case, 1,300 Singapore dollars - but are almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Phonebrokers in Singapore generally charge 17 per cent per annum, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not needing credit checks or proof of salary, and can provide loans more quickly than a bank.
Millions of people in this sector are turning to Ponshop due to the difficulty faced by families due to rising living costs and rising domestic and consumer debt.
After five years of strong growth after the global financial crisis, and cheap credit due to the simplified monetary policy in developed economies, low and middle income families are turning to pawn shops to meet their needs due to the slowdown of their economies.
This week, the rating agency, Standards and Powers, cited rising domestic profits, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt as a proportion of GDP in Asia.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged mildly from the tech slump this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued export slowdown and decline in consumer demand.
"The crucial point is that with rising prices, people in the middle to lower [income] bracket will try to increase their income in every possible way", said Song Seng Won, an economist at Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
The historically high values in gold prices over the last two years have prompted people to pledge personal assets as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 per cent of the items mortgaged in the 200 PON outlets of the city - state are gold.
People are saying, "The price of gold looks good, let's mortgage Grandma's gold chain, and take it back next month.
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, eGemini, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlet in recent months.
The business of pawnshop has grown so much that ValueMax, the outlet operator in Bendemir and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighbourhood, Malaysia where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says ValueMax Executive Director Yah Lee Ching.
The company will finance it by using 60 per cent of the 66 million Singapore dollars received in the listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While the high interest rates have been criticized by some discount lenders, Ms. Yah says that not only does holding a mortgage get cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
"Clients mortgage things they already have, and the repayment of personal assets does not increase household debt", she says.
The social acceptance of pawnbroking for short term and secure financial assistance is increasing.
It is not that only financially weak people use pawnbrokers.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax outlets, they mortgage gold bars or Rolex watches, which can provide cash payment of up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have clients from all walks of life.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs", says Ms. Yah.
Sometimes they need money in a very short time.

$325 million rescue package for the health of TAG
The Union Government has insisted that the $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's declining health system also includes strict conditions that will ensure that the state government does not squander funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "immediate action" to address the current crisis due to the island state's aging population, high rate of chronic diseases, and systemic limitations.
The funding, to be carried out over four years, was decided after consultation with the Government, including Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges facing the State", Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million alternative surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help resolve the previously accumulated cases.
This includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and the launch of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading practitioners to improve Tasmania's healthcare system", said Ms Plibersek.
The Minister emphasised that the Government of Tasmania will face a tough reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive Commonwealth funds, and report each month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is provided by the State in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said that $325 million would not mean much "unless real reforms are made to bring Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level".
Nevertheless, he commended the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful towards removing the state public health system from the crisis list", said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional alternative procedures will largely reverse recent deductions.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a band-aid solution".
"We are here because the Labor State government has taken $430 million from its health system.
You cannot consider it a good day that the state government has taken almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth has given 300 million dollars.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on extra bureaucracy.
The adaptation of Dennis Deirdre 's novel by Guillaume Nichols has a great production design and time period, but it has gone far beyond what it should have.
Set in France in 1760, the novel tells the tragic story of a young noblewoman named Suzanne, who is sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels she is subjected to extreme cruelty at the hands of the voluntary oppressor Mother Superior, and becomes the object of erotic attraction to another.
This film never gets into the sexuality or the sensation - and that's the problem.
The seriousness of the storyline also risks turning it into a boring film for the audience.
Dr. Munna Singh, Vice President of CSA has decided to charge an entrance fee to the garden due to the dirt that has been spread in the garden.
At the same time, the government has given 15 days to correct the dire situation of the departments.
The Vice Chancellor, along with the Department of Horticulture, conducted an on-site inspection of the Vice Director Seed and Field and Director Research at 10 am on Friday.
During this time, he found more than a dozen employees including the director in these departments were dismissed from their seats.
After rebuking him, he warned of salary cuts if he was found absent next time.
Dr. Naushad Khan, Media In-charge of the University, said that a monthly pass of Rs. 30 will be required for the tour.
People will be able to walk in the garden for a fee of one rupee per day.
The system will be the work: The files coming before the Vice President related to various tasks will reach under one system.
Not every employee shall have the right to enter the VC office with his file.
The concerned officers will deliver their final to the Vice President.
The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons development capability.
The monitoring group said on Thursday that Syria had destroyed critical equipment for making chemical weapons and poison gas warfare materials, while fierce fighting erupted in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to where the toxic agents are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that some 120,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons comes one day before the November 1 deadline.
The Hague - based organization had ordered Damascus to destroy or "deactivate" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix toxic gases and fill war materials.
The completion of the initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in this ambitious development, which aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means that Syria can no longer build new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and the collection.
Syria is believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that the announcement came as fighting escalated on Thursday in the town of Safir, which experts believe is a chemical weapons production facility as well as a storage center.
The movement group, which maintains death tolls in Syria through the movement's network, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
It has said that among them 61,067 are civilians including 6,365 children.
The government said 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad's military, 18,678 were fighters fighting on the government side and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead were 2,202 army deserters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that about 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since.
About 20 lakh people have been forced to flee the country because of this conflict.
Assad 's military forces fought rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom were affiliated with al - Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything explicit.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short timeframe.
The statement from the OPCW, working with the UN, said its team "is now satisfied and has confirmed - and seen all of Syria's declared critical production and blending/filling equipment - destroyed".
It also said, "No further inspection activity is planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of the verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said that they were unable to visit the two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, the OPCW said that according to Syria the two centers "have been abandoned and... chemical weapons products stored there were transferred to other declared centers, which have been inspected".
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Safira was one of the two centres where OPCW inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I salute the determination and courage you have shown in completing the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken", said Director General of the Monitoring Group, Ahmet Uzumcu, in a statement released by the OPCW.
The three - year civil war is mainly between the Assad government and its security forces, including members of the Alawite sect, who have defected from Shiite Islam, and the rebellious Sunni Muslims.
In another development, the head of the observatory, Rami Abdulrahman, said that a powerful explosion occurred at the Air Defense Centre in the coastal region of Latakia, Syria, on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion is not yet known.
Police have recovered forged registry, forged seals, laptop and photocopies of forged registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar Police has registered all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajiv Aggarwal aka Binttu from Chandra Nagar, Habowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal from Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi from Kohara and Sonu from Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the Registrar Office (Eastern) has fled the scene.
According to the police, the accused, together with the Registrar Office Clerk and Recordkeeper Balbir Singh, would take out papers from the records of empty and old lands and then buy new stamp paper and prepare a fake registry on them.
Not only that, but they would then remove the real registry and paste it into the fake registry record.
The accused then sold the land for crores of rupees on forged papers.
At the same time, they took out loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was subjected to the police and the administration.
The accused who had prepared the fake registry had a special eye on the NRIGs' lands.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
So it is easy to make a fake land registry and sell it.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told in questioning that they have prepared about 150 fake registers so far.
According to police, the gang leader Rajeev has been charged with fraud and theft in the past.
Anger over the conviction of the plotter of the Bali bombing
Relatives and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 bombing, expressing outrage at the punishment given to the bomb plotter, said that Omar Patek should face firing squad.
Patek, who was on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men for nearly 10 years, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released in 15 years if granted parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of the mass murder of two people by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many more.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including the Christmas Eve church bombings in Indonesia in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have demanded the death penalty for the man known as the bomb-making mastermind, the notorious "destroyer".
The decision refreshed the painful memories of June Courtine, a Perth resident who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
He said that Patek should have been executed.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other terrible terrorists.
"He should be brought before the firing squad", Ms. Cortin told A.A.P.
I have to live without my grandchildren and my daughters every day.
The club was obliterated shortly after 11 pm on 12 October 2002 after a bomb exploded in a van parked outside the Di Saria Club.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when the bag filled with explosives was detonated by suicide bombers exactly 20 seconds before.
He went into a month - long coma as a result of the bombing incident and "died" three times while on life - saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says that Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jemmaah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for the massacre - Amaroji, Mukhallas and Imam Samudra - who were sentenced to death four years ago.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There 's no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bombings.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally arrested in January 2011, in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military had killed former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent presented evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bill Laden in an effort to reestablish contact between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"She did not give up", says Ms. Cortin.
Even today, he is not really sad about causing so many people mental anguish.
The decision, this year, comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year", said Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal against his sentence.
FAA: Airplane passengers can now use gadgets on board (but not call from cell phones)
Airplane passengers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate to disembarking - but not to talk to their cell phones - under highly anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a press conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said how quickly these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and how they are updating the rules for collecting training manuals and devices for their crew members to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on board aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the status of the plan, we may approve the expanded use of the electronic device very soon", the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are expected not to operate them until they reach 10,000 ft altitude of the aircraft and have been given permission by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again at the time of landing, and not turn them on until the aircraft has landed completely.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully secure from electronic interference may allow their passengers to use the device during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these standards.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is safely implemented - and we work with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides", Glading said in a statement.
We are tired of feeling like "hall monitors" when it comes to this issue.
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the Internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there's still no conversation with friends, online games like Scrabble, which is linked to the famous incident in 2011 when actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the gate, and American Airlines took him off the plane when he refused to turn the device off.
And heavy equipment like laptops etc. will still have to be collected as their bouncing will cause concern of injury to other person in the cabin.
Cell phone calls will also continue to be banned during the flight.
The regulatory authority for phone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
The FAA may remove restrictions on certain electronic devices during takeoff and landing of aircraft.
Last month, Mark Rosenkan of the National Transportation Safety Board, who is a national transportation safety expert for CBS News, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really serious issues, not only because they can potentially cause disruption to navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruption to cell phone towers when in the air", said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month recommended that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use has been increasing in recent years.
Critics such as Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, have said there is no valid safety reason for the ban.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult to enforce because the use of the device is so pervasive.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore their device shutdown instructions.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 after receiving reports of disruption to navigation and communication devices due to passengers carrying FM radios and high-tech gadgets of the time.
New airline companies are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they too have been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi system are also more resistant to interference.
He said most airlines should meet the eligibility criteria for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today 's electronic devices emit radio transmission of much less power than the previous generation of electronic devices.
For example, e-readers, when turning a page, there is a very nominal transmission.
But transmission is strong when data is downloaded or sent by the device.
Amazon.com has been among those who have advocated easing restrictions on the use of the device by passengers.
In 2011, the company's officials loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airlines and flew it for problems testing but found no such problems.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risks associated with the use of the device.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aircraft Passenger Association said he believes the disruption from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by pilots in support of the device interference in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the Committee members recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device when the aircraft is being landed in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and called them, "common sense convenience for travellers in the latest era of technology".
Roger Doe, CEO of the US Travel Association, said, "We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that traveling with pleasure is not inconsistent with safety and security.
Learning from the series of bombings in Patna, the UT Police has been prepared for quick reaction during the Diwali celebrations and during the emergency situations in the light of security.
A total of 1800 soldiers will patrol all the main places of the city, crowded markets and other places including vehicles and on foot to ensure smooth running of traffic, prevent clashes, teach lessons to the marchers and arrest those who have perpetrated other incidents.
The personnel will include female police personnel including PCR, Traffic Unit.
Police personnel and commandos will also conduct vigilant check-ups of duty records at other places including hotels, guest houses and PG in the city.
The SHO has been directed to form a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to investigate the cases.
DSPs, including inspectors, have been tasked with conducting inspections at markets, malls and other places including VIP sectors of the city.
In view of the emergency situation and the festival of Diwali, the High Commissioners have also set the duty of additional police personnel in the Police Control to facilitate the people.
Police also asked the staff of the fire department and other dispensaries besides the management of Sector-16 GMSH and Sector-32 GMSH including Director, Principal Director and DHS of PGI to maintain high alert in case of emergency.
To teach the minds a lesson, the departmental officers have now put others on duty, including women police personnel, under the leadership of the NGO, as 'Anti Gunda Staff'.
Police officers of the Anti-Gumstaff team will be standing by in plain clothes in crowded places including markets and will arrest the marchers.
On Diwali, all SHOs have been ordered to plant 44 noses in the inner city.
Police personnel will also be on standby at 38 NAKA points on the city borders.
The bird was released back into the wild by air transport for protection from the North Sea rig.
A bird found stranded on a North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild by air transport from the coast.
The water rail was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen before being recovered by the Scottish SPCA back to their rescue centre at Aloha.
"This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, caught in high winds over the North Sea", explained Centre Manager Colin Seddon.
It seems that this bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
"It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help", he added.
The water rail was healthy and fit before it was abandoned.
Are the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with a pledge to bring business together and determine what changes the UK's job and prosperity makers want to see in our relationship with the EU.
To that end, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they thought about UK business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders, representative of UK business size, sectors and locations.
The findings of this survey may surprise many.
We found that a large proportion of businessmen now want to export outside Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member states are becoming stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than engage in the long and arduous process of reforming the EU's secretive institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that control of these decisive qualities should be returned to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market was easily seen, with businessmen saying that the cost of Brussels regulation far outweighed the benefits of remaining part of Europe's business area - even 40 percent of the giants who had traditionally favored European companies agreed.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that a large proportion clearly wants the UK to move towards a trade-based relationship and treaty change with the EU rather than politics.
The findings, which were seen at the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen were pushing for a "meaningful change" that would restore the UK to its lost power.
It comes at a very high price - the issue of treaty change and a better deal for Britain changed the polling stance to 16 percent in favour of remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this poll shows that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate the terms of UK membership of the EU.
It also showed that businessmen expect to renegotiate, making a meaningful change to shift the current balance of power in the UK's favour.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and is rapidly becoming essential as the eurozone moves towards a circular economy and fiscal union.
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for business this means a new focus on trade and a fundamental change in the way Brussels regulates.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called the pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new era.
The head of Gazprom said that the start of construction of the South Stream Gas Pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the biggest energy projects in Europe.
Today, a historic event has taken place: Construction has begun on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe. " This was stated by Alexei Miller, President of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where the bulk of Russia's gas to Europe is, poses a risk to conventional routes, officials said.
A direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are "forever" eliminated, Miller said.
After the start of operation of the entire project in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive discounted rates of gas from South Stream.
Gazprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two Y.M.C.A. employees charged with sexual offences before charges against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hears
Before charges were brought against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, two YMCA NSW employees were charged with child sex offences.
But in its statement to the Commission it said that it had "never come across a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", the Commission was told.
Chief Executive Philip Hare was asked about the case in which a Y.M.C.A. employee was charged with child pornography offences, and another case in which a Y.M.C.A. Caringbah gym instructor was charged with child sex offences against children in his care in 1991.
Mr Hare, who was assisting the Commission, told the lawyer Gail Farnes that he was aware of the first case but not of the second.
He also admitted that the statement of YMCA before the Commission that "YMCA has been subjected to external scrutiny and they have found YMCA to be at the forefront of child safety" is also inaccurate.
The Commission has evidence that the YMCA was notified and it received the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr Hare, who has been associated with the Y.M.C.A. since the age of 21, admitted that the appointment of Lord had led to a failure of management "including myself" and a failure to ensure that staff were clearly aware of their responsibilities in reporting child protection policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of 12 sex crimes against children during his two-year stint at the Y.M.C.A.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr Hare rejected the suggestion that there was a cultural problem at the YMCA, which caused the staff not to report child protection violations by Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw of the violation, including spending time alone with the children by Lord, babysitting them privately, sitting them on his lap, telling them he loved them and letting them play on his mobile phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the Lord 's supervision and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that the Y.M.C.A. Caringbah child services manager who supervised the Lord was "very intimidating and difficult to find most of the time".
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in reporting above their manager.
He said that rather his friendship with Lord had misled his decision to report him.
Mr. Hare said that he had provided his view to the YMCA NSW congregation that the lesson for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about not informing".
Mr Hare said the decision to have the employees sign a confidentiality agreement was made by Liam Whiteley, General Manager of Child Services at the YMCA, shortly after the allegations came to light.
He said that it was aimed at avoiding the mixing of evidence, but it was "hyper - enthusiastic" and not executed properly.
Stephen Smallbone, Professor of Child Sexual Abuse at Griffith University, said that while Jonathan Lord was in office between 2099 and 2011, the YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation.
He said there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, screening, admission, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Blair says he wants to return to Britain
Tony Blair said he would like another chance to be Prime Minister of the UK - but he believes there is no chance of a comeback.
In an interview taken on the evening of the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, the 59-year-old Blair shared his views on various domestic policies.
After stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his remarks to his role as a representative of the Foreign Affairs and Middle East Group of peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return as Prime Minister, Mr Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, certainly, but it is unlikely, so... "
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community in the wake of the financial crisis.
When the crowd of experts gathered in Cardiff to showcase the horse for the best horse of the year, they knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for three - year - old Fenton Kirkland.
Just months away from taking her first step, this toddler and her Shetland pet, Tattoo Taffy, completed the three stages with ease and won the top prize - she outran her 30 adult rivals.
At the annual competition held by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff, the indistinguishable pair - the Sk - were highly praised for their looks, behaviour and style.
In front of men and women wearing beautiful bowler hats, he tilted his flat cap at a right angle and circled his two - year - old toffee around the ring.
The judges praised Fenton for his natural ability to control which is far beyond his age.
Toffi got the highest marks for her looks and personality.
Fenton was given the toffee as a gift on his third birthday last March, and he has been practicing with this Shetland duck every day since.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great couple".
They were challenged by all the candidates, but they both won the Gold Cup and the Rosette.
This was only the second time he had entered a competition with Toffi, and we are all very happy with his win.
The most unusual thing in this scene, he was so amazing that everyone wanted to take a picture with him.
This little boy from the village of Nanttiglow near Abbe Vale, South Wales, is following in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over 10 years.
"The whole place was filled with excitement, and everyone was cheering and clapping", said Mr. Howells.
He was running on the sand all over the arena, and despite his small appearance, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is an animal lover - he loves horses, tractors, and farming, and he has two chickens that he takes care of.
The way he has started, he will be at the best horse show of the year long ago - and I am confident he will do very well.
"Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his mare", said a spokesman for the annual horse show.
They make a great couple.
The judges scored Fenton and Toffee based on their performance and their performance in the show ring.
He saw good teamwork between the Tattus and their rider - in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton's lovely clothes helped him, he looked really very different.
The Chinese newspaper that argues will be "revived"
A Chinese newspaper that had a front page appeal for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write a fabricated story about a state-owned company.
The regulator said that the New Express has now to undergo a "complete reform".
The order for "reform" came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a number of false reports about the listed company Joomloon between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "editorial management of the New Express was disorderly".
It said it had decided to impose an "administrative penalty by revoking the license of Chen Yongzhou's reporter".
It "directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a thorough overhaul of New Express, investigate those responsible at New Express and recommend an immediate overhaul of the leadership team of New Express".
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities at a construction - equipment company called Joomla.
After his suspension, his newspaper published two front page appeals for his release, and said it supported Mr. Chen 's journalism.
But then Mr. Chen came on state television and admitted to writing and publishing false stories for money.
"In this case, I have damaged Joomla, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people's trust", he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did so mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, the New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.
At the moment, many high-profile suspects have made televised confessions.
Experts say that forced confessions are occasionally made, despite a law later this year that prohibited authorities from forcing a person to confess.
The Sri Hanuman Chalisa will be recited by the National President of the Anti-Terrorist Front, Maninderjit Singh Bitta along with 10,000 children at the Shri Hanuman Chalisa recitation, which will be held at Dana Mandi, near Jalandhar Bypass, on 23rd November, on behalf of the Shri Hindu Justice Bench.
This information was given by Bitta to the audience after the Chief Spokesperson of the Sri Hindu Judicial Bench Praveen Dung and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupinder Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma invited him to read Hanuman Chalisa.
He appreciated the efforts of the Sri Hindu Jubal Bench to connect children with the Sanatan culture.
He said that religious education, including secular education, is also necessary for the unity and integrity of the country.
U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel found its own railroad
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the U.S.A. and Mexico has been discovered, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the four-foot by three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is roughly the steep length of six football pitches, connecting the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, U.S.A.
The area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being loaded.
Officials said that it was closed before any drugs could pass through the tunnel.
According to court records, authorities have seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel exploration.
Three individuals, who authorities said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distribution.
If convicted, he could be sentenced to 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of the vast underground drains.
This tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered since the marijuana crop of central Mexico in October, posing a challenge to the drug mafia groups as to how to get the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 700-yard trail equipped with rail tracks that stretched from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to the San Diego warehouses.

British police have sent an extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and has requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to 40-year-old Australian Assange, for which he would have to appear at the police station, adding that he would be solely responsible for his arrest if he failed to do so.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sex offender charges, and his options under British law were exhausted when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he requested political asylum from the South American country, and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at the police station on the date and time chosen by us".
He is in violation of the terms of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the issue of police notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges for releasing more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-privacy website WikiLeaks.
A fine of 1000 pounds for driving at 130 mph with a hot drink between the legs

The Department of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measures but is awaiting the final decision from Mr Osborne who introduced a stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent in the 2012 Budget for houses worth over £ 2 million and for individuals who prefer to have a house in a company rather than a separate person.
In tax year 2012/13 the stamp duty collected from residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea was £ 708 million, already more than the sum of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty on high value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a less than reasonable tax on high value property, which has nothing to do with the effect of the outdated Council tax system.
He added that "but this move may make some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London and reluctant to sell to the current owners".
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market by value in affluent south west London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has grown by a record 11.8 per cent in the last year.
According to Savills' research, prices in central London continued to rise steadily at 5.6 per cent each year, but appeared to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market", as the city's south west, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) saw a surge.
Scientists have further shed light on the relationship between the movements of a dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from a dog's point of view), while restless dogs move their tail more to the left, mainly.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle difference in the tail and react to it.
The study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
"It is well known in humans that the left and right hemispheres of the brain are involved in different ways in the stimulation that produces positive or negative emotions", says neuroscientist Professor Georgia Vellertiger of the University of Trento.
Here we have tried to see it in other species.
He noted that in dogs, like in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movements and inverse order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral muzzling by other dogs, researchers observed animals watching films of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeats of the pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vellertiger explained: "We introduced dogs to dog films - in realistic versions or in shots to deal with other confusing issues, and we could see the tail movements and render the tail more left or right".
When the animals saw an unfeeling dog wagging its tail to the right (in the dog 's eyes), they were completely at ease.
But when he saw the tail turned and turned mainly to the left (again in the dog 's eyes), his heart rate increased and he looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellortigra, he does not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from experience what actions they should be concerned about and which ones not.
He said, "If you've met other dogs several times, and if they're constantly wagging their tail on one side, it's associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side presents less friendly behavior, you react based on that same experience".
The researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better insight into the emotions of animals.
John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, an expert in dog behaviour, said this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In another study from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: "Contrary to the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was waved to the left rather than the right, the dogs were more likely to approach it rather than to be restless".
He said that this difference was because in various studies dogs were not fully understanding animals or robot dogs in films.
He explained that this could be helped by studying how dogs react to real dogs.
"While there is considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still to be gained - and in this case dogs are no exception", he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed Glasgow gig because of Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer suffered from throat cancer.
The Sheffield Group was scheduled to demonstrate at the Hydro site in the city on Friday.
But the illness of their lead singer Alex Turner forced them to reschedule the show.
The band's announcement came as they were forced to postpone a gig at the LG Arena in Birmingham in a similar fashion on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the show at Birmingham LG Arena tonight after medical advice, Arctic Monkeys will also have to postpone the show at Glasgow Hydro on Friday, 1st November.
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with throat cancer, and is unfortunately unable to perform".
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will now be on 20 November, and the show at Glasgow Hydro on 21 November.
All tickets will remain valid for these shows.
We apologize for any inconvenience to all ticket holders.
For any other assistance, contact the customer service of the box office where you bought the tickets.
Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will name a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals, the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, are below the pope only, and they are the ones who choose the pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his people, who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are 201 cardinals in total.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80 the cardinals are not allowed to participate in papal elections - they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of the promotion of new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called the papal assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to hold the February papal council, to facilitate planning for other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different countries of the world", Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of cardinal electors was likely to be reduced.
He said that the Pope normally announces the number of cardinal electors as few as 120, and cardinals over the age of 80 at his pleasure.
The next papal conclave will be important, Valero said, as it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year.
There is a certain prejudice towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if the new popes nominate cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance", he said.
Forty percent of South America is Roman Catholic, but cardinals are a very small minority.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis establishes the Council of Cardinals - a group of eight cardinals from around the world whose task is to explore ways of reforming the Church.
Before that the Pope decided everything himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him", Valero said.
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we are not the first to be in this situation - it is quite new.
Valero said that the pope usually gives the title of cardinal to bishops of large places, but Francis "was completely surprising - so we don't know who they'll announce".
GM recalls pickup trucks in the U.S. to fix seatbacks
According to a report from U.S. auto safety regulators on Friday, General Motors Co. has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a shortfall in hand-rotated seatbacks in its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a shortfall in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the Union failed to comply with the Auto Safety Standards regarding seatback, head restraint.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle is trapped from behind, it is possible that the head restraint will not protect the driver adequately, increasing the risk of injury".
The recalled models were manufactured between 1st August and 10th September.
GM's trucks started shipping in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, marks the most significant launch for the top US automaker.
GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.
NSTMA was unable to review the notification due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had hampered the growth in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that sales of Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had increased by 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, GM had sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Cira pickup trucks.
GM shares were up 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
Obama's voters scream in despair
I voted for Obama twice in the hope of change.
They say that the GOP's policy of obstruction has hampered Obama's great efforts.
The policy of blockade cannot excuse the misery of the Obamacare website, the drone attacks
The memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a reminder of what could have been.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I feel will give me a boost and a ray of hope during the second year of medical school.
It is called "Courage to Win", and it is reminiscent of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I am able to relax at night from my patients' prescriptions and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could hold your breath.
The election proved to be one - sided, and the newsmen paused to reflect the historical significance of the time.
My classmates were filled with tears of joy, and my parents saved every newspaper they could find.
A group of young visionaries were heading to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82 percent.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh reality, like coming back from a dream world.
Those days of hope are hard to remember - they seem like a distant memory, a sad memory of lost opportunities.
The first time I voted, things really changed.
I simply could not imagine any of this.
I credit Obama with many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act, to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, to the end of "don't ask, don't tell", to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the policy of biased protest has hampered many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public options for health care, closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the countless times I have defended myself to colleagues and colleagues for the Obama administration, I have run out of answers to give them.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican protest policy is not an answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it an answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens nor to prosecutions of people exposing wrongdoing by the government.
It cannot explain the murder of US citizen Anwar El Awlaki without a trial, nor the declining public funds and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It cannot answer the findings of the report, which says that the White House's efforts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration".
And most recently, it can't excuse the failure to design a simple website three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don 't know if I expected that .
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of government could reject the political campaign that was pushing it forward.
Obviously, elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events like the Newtown Massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet the examples I have given above seem to have been mostly chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative that did not seem to define his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is below 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to go back to the year 2008 through that book.
He reminds me of their lost promises.
I was reading a section of the book this week that described how Clinton was severely damaged by Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
He said, "I want my mojo back".
We must remember who we are.
Today, after five years, Mr President, I cannot agree with you more.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims that PM Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the paternity leave scheme
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the paternity leave scheme because his daughters can get pregnant, and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has made claims while trying to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer's United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether to cut carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from the policies.
"They may have a significant conflict of interest in the matter of paternity leave being granted, because if any of their daughters become pregnant they would have a direct interest in whether or not they get the leave", Mr. Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after falling again.
Mr. Palmer called for the resumption of the counting to speed up the process.
Tony Aot's daughters are Frances and Bridget.
Should the results of the election come two months after we have voted?
They said, "We need to have a better system".
Why can 't we have a system where we fill in our statements on the computer, vote instantly and have the results at 6.30 p.m.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
That is, because if someone doesn 't like it, they can delete it?
Pencil is a nonsense in this day and age.
The Election Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint consultation letter with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new assignment "very seriously".
Public office is for public service.
"We need no other award than the History Prize for serving the community at this critical time", he said.
This caused problems for the parties.
Addressing the gathering on the occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his deep anger at the deteriorating law and order situation in the State.
He said the increasing number of attacks on lawyers and their families is proof that criminals have become fearless.
They have no fear of police or administrative system.
Referring to recent incidents of this kind in different places, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be intuitively estimated.
RBS suspends two Forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, two experts on the matter have told us, another indication that a global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is moving at a fast pace.
Some of the world 's biggest banks including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation of the world ' s largest financial market, which trades $ 5.3 trillion every day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS to be suspended as the investigation of what appears to be a recurrence of Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal progresses.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago the bank had said, "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators".
Last month, experts on the matter said that RBS had forwarded records of emails and instant messages sent to and received from the ex-trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, named Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is believed to have been dismissed from his current position as European head of spot forex trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at City, went on leave last week, while the former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Experts on the matter said that Mr. Usher's instant messaging group includes Barclays and Citigroup bankers.
UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after it was told by the Swiss regulator, FINMA, that it is investigating suspicious foreign exchange market manipulation in many Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally - the European Commission, FINMA, the Swiss competition authority VECO, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of bankers being manipulated to manipulate the currency market.
People familiar with the matter said HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators.
Banks have been scrutinizing instant messages and emails for years in search of clues of wrongdoing.
The news of the probe has stirred up traders in the sector, who have been among the top profiteers in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but are facing a challenge this year as the low volatility in currencies has reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price".
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it would be discharging traders from its Exchange Traded Funds desk in London this week, which had lost nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has notified the relevant authorities immediately and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said "we believe the trader acted alone, and was controlled".
Students studying other courses including technical and management courses running on campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice Chancellor of the University has written to the Governor for permission to hold the election.
With the commencement of the admission process in the university, demands were raised for the holding of student union elections.
He also launched a signature campaign for the selection of his representative to convey his voice to the university administration and college management.
Students enrolled in about two dozen courses including BTech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science, which are run on campus, will be able to elect their representatives this year.
More than six thousand students studying here will get the opportunity to exercise their franchise for the first time.
Vice Chancellor Prof. Ashok Kumar informed that permission has been sought from the Governor to hold elections at the University.
The date of election will be announced as soon as permission is given.
He said, it is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges.
Many college managers do not want student union elections on their campus.
At the same time, elections are not being held due to lack of unity among students.
The Council had conducted a signature campaign for the election.
Aakash Jaiswal, the department coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, permission will be sought from the district administration to hold elections in colleges.
The lack of clarity of the views of the colleges on the student union elections is also causing difficulties.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of gold and silver in the capital.
The number of such purchases has increased by 20-30 per cent over the previous year.
The jewellery shops in Shimla were crowded with longs.
The pottery shops from Lower Bazar to Malrod were also crowded.
Although the price of such items was rising this year, people did not hesitate to shop at the auspicious time.
The auspicious time for shopping on Friday was from 7:52 to 10:12 am and from 1:56 to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 to 8:12 pm.
During the three mohurts, the crowds of people in the suburbs including Shimla, gathered for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Bazaar, people did not have a place to set foot.
The crowds in every small store were similarly busy.
In such a situation, shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Dhantrayoshi, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
The Supreme Court upheld the Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Health Care Act named after Barack Obama to be constitutional.
In a 5-4 vote, the judges ruled in favour of a separate provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which would require citizens to buy or pay health insurance before 2014 - that it was constitutional under the power of the government to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported the four other liberal members of the court, while the other Justices Scalia, Thoss, Elliott and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 page Act, and held that the condition of the Health Care Act that states increase Medicaid eligibility or lose all federal Medicaid funding was not unconstitutionally peremptory.
The petition was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Businesses to stop the law.
During the 2012 opening session, the law was opposed by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including projected nominee Mitt Romney.
It is true that without money we cannot do our work.
Money is one of the greatest necessities for life, but it is not in our interest to take it for granted.
We celebrate Dhanteras on the Krishna Tryoda of the Kartik month.
Dhanteras is worshipped as the god of wealth, Kuber, and as the god of death, Yamaraja.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
There is good and bad in our attitude towards money.
Nothing is more valuable than wealth that serves the welfare of mankind, but wealth that serves the ego is meaningless.
We should earn money for holy purposes and spend it for holy purposes.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of his family.
Part of it must be the feeling of spending on society, but the tendency to accumulate unreasonably or to earn money in a way that is not our own destroys our conscience, our personality.
The spirit of charity should always be in mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also be the basis of someone 's livelihood.
We should all think about the many people in society who are living in dire need.
In fact, in the Purnishthara of life, meaning, religion, work and salvation are given equal importance.
All people desire wealth and success and according to their man - arth they get wealth and success.
The wealth is the lasting one with which honor is connected.
No matter how rich a criminal may be, he cannot use it properly nor can he be of use to others.
Do not envy someone else if he has money.
The true rich is he who has made the way for wealth to flow into countless hands.
There is no better use of money than the creation of employment for others.
And another thing, money does not exist only in the form of currency.
It would also be in the form of your health, your character, your love for others.
Try to become the owner of this wealth.

According to sources, presenting Ujjay Ahmed before the court, the NIA reported that Ujjay Ahmed was mainly involved in the incident along with Imtiaz Ansari and Haider, the members of the Indian Mujahideen, the main accused of the Patna serial blasts.
Ahmed had introduced several other terrorists to Ansari.
The NIA wants to arrest other accused in the case through interrogation of Ahmed.
The search for the bomb material and the terrorists who made it is still pending.
For this, they have to take Ahmed to Bihar, Jharkhand and several other states, for which he needs to be taken on remand.

The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed a fraud in the PMT of 2012 a day earlier.
STF has found a glitch in the roll number of 700 students in the investigation.
Of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
After the STF revelation, the Department of Medical Education has started a brainstorming to cancel the admission of these students.
The Department is reportedly awaiting the list of all these suspected students from STF.
The list of students involved will be sent to the Businessman for cancellation of eligibility.
However, the department is also suggesting legal advice in this matter.
Departmental officials say that students who are admitted in 2012 have been admitted for one year, so it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
The matter is limited to STF investigation so far and the medical education department officials are not in a position to comment.
Business Manager Tarun Pithore says that if STF submits a list of suspected students with evidence, their admission will be cancelled immediately.
Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava, Director Medical Education, said that the students have not been denied admission if the admission was found to be false.
According to STF officials, the fake students involved in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to the businessman.
It is noteworthy that the Prabham had disqualified 345 suspected students from the PMT examination held in 2013.
Of these 345, 84 have been cancelled by the Department of Medical Education.
MLA from Poonch Assembly constituency, Ejaz Jan inaugurated the water cooler at the Gurudwara complex.
The MLA said that a large number of people are coming and going in Gurudwara but due to lack of proper drinking water system, water coolers have been installed.

Pure plain water will be available in winter season.
This will alleviate the drinking water problem of the pilgrims.
Members of the Gurudwara Committee as well as others were present on the occasion.
After the general election, if the new government continues its policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then in half a dozen states kerosene will not be available at these stores.
States that have to stop selling kerosene include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, the sale of kerosene is also being prepared in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the North East.
According to sources from the Ministry of Petroleum, the decision to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states will be taken on two grounds.
First, rapidly power connections are being made in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, in the states where most rural households have been given LPG connections, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Ministry of Petroleum has made a thorough preparation for this.
The sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been stopped since October 2013.
Sources said that under this policy, the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced significantly.
The quota of Punjab was reduced from 2.72 lakh kL to one lakh kL.
The allocation of kerosene in Uttarakhand was reduced by 70 per cent and in Haryana by almost 40 per cent.
Despite this cut, there is no report of kerosene shortage from these states.
The Ministry believes that this indicates that kerosene has been used for blending.
The difference in the price of PDS kerosene and diesel is Rs. 37 at present.
This encourages the reconciliators.
In the states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs. 31 thousand crore.
The accused used to open accounts of investors by quoting trading firm to forge shares in the name of buying and selling.
Possibly: This is the first time in the state that a scam of Rs. crores has been revealed.
The police have not been able to reach the gang leader, but seven people, including the accused who witnessed his work in the state, have been taken into custody.
The gang operated a fake commodity market under the name of Metatrader 5.
The company 's creditors used to take cash from investors and give it to them by creating fake IDs on a fake software.
This allowed the accused to see the shares bought by investors when trading.
It even showed which shares were bought at what price.
In fact, no shares were bought or transacted, as no demat account was opened for investors and the shares were misrepresented on this fake software.
Police are estimating that hundreds of people have been in the gang's sights.
Every investor was allowed to invest from two to five lakh rupees in the name of making a profit.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been taken into custody by Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while six other accomplices have been apprehended from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dhohr, any stock trading company must be associated with the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company get the investors to trade the shares.
Then the investor 's demat account is opened, so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company called MetaTrader 5 was not associated with any exchange or trading stock.
The company had bought the server for itself on 24 September 2012 under the name WinTrade, citing trading.
Since then, people have been being fooled by this company in the name of investment.
Eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to complain in the cyber cell.
Even after selling the shares at a profit, the amount was not transferred to the account.
He began to demand the amount of the profits from the shareholders of the company.

Anderson and James Neisham took eight wickets together.
Anderson took four for 40 and Neesham took four for 53.

The Gate City Circle office, which is earning Rs. crores per day to Punjab State Power Corporation, is being built in the ruins.
All employees are forced to work in fear of accident.
The staff is in a state of panic as cement falls from the roofs of the building.
Built in 1913 during the British era, this building was the office of the Municipal Corporation.
In 1995 the building was handed over to the Electricity Board.
The department is just scratching the surface by getting painted in the name of repairs.
The building is in such a state that the employees are afraid to sit in it.

BJP PM candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Deenat Mangeshkar Hospital, made sharp attacks on the Congress while addressing an election rally on Friday.
Modi said, "In many states and centers of the country, sometimes coalition governments were formed, sometimes Congress governments, sometimes Communists governments, and sometimes BJP governments.
You have seen multi-party rule.
I appeal to the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the party do?
If the results are comparable, the question will not arise whether the BJP should come to power.
Every time wherever the BJP government has been formed, there has been an effort to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
The country is witness to the low inflation in the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man had two meals.
But when the Congress or its supporters formed the government, the poor man was not fortunate enough to eat.
Not a single Congress leader, not a single UPA leader is responding to what they have done in nine and a half years.
Even the media in our country cannot reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even answer the media.
The elections are for Lok Sabha, you answer to the people.
Modi said, "M Modi is being questioned today. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, then every year they will give an account of their work to the people.
In a democracy, there should be servants in Delhi, not rulers.
There can be no Naths in Delhi, there should only be slaves.
Congress friends leave balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have passed the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, the people take the exam.
In the case of Nortel patents, there are economic lawsuits against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday filed a series of patent lawsuits against cell phone makers including Google, which it had outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, which bought Nortel patents for 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., HTC Corp., Huawei and four other companies in U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said that the patents also include technology that combines words searched on the Internet with words from relevant advertisements, which is the core of Google's search business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is a tough competitor to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had made an initial bid of $ 900 million for the Northtel patents.
Google increased the bid several times and finally offered $ 4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in the Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $ 12.5 billion, one of the main reasons being that Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment stated that "Google has violated, and continues to violate, despite losing an attempt to acquire patents-in-suit at auction".
Rockstar has sought increased damages against Google, alleging that it is malicious in its claim that Google is infringing patents.
Believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but his victory day could hardly bring an end to the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office as the country's first freely elected president, replacing ousted Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago.
On his formal inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the first independently elected Islamist president in the Arab world, and the fifth president of Egypt since the monarchy was overthrown almost 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office on the banks of the Nile, in front of 18 black-robed judges of the court, in a chair that looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are aspiring for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said during the official ceremony, which was shown live on national television.
The radical Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an outlawed organization since its founding and which has been targeted by previous governments, said Morsi, 60, a U.S.-trained engineer with the party, "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life - complete freedom, true democracy and stability".
Hundreds of soldiers and police officers secured the building and arrived in Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 am local time.
Apart from the presidential hype of the Mubarak era, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to congratulate the new president, with traffic also briefly halted so that their motorcade could leave the normally busy road connecting the city centre with its southern suburbs.
Moursi, who was ridiculed as the Brotherhood's uncharismatic "empty tire",'s personal reputation grew greatly after his victory and his speech on Friday presented him as a candidate not just for Islamists but for all those who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against the dictator Mubarak.
Dressed in a blue business suit and red tie, Morsi took the oath of office before the judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying "Today Egypt is a civilized, national, constitutional and modern nation".
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he was to give his commencement address.
He was given an official welcome by the military band playing the national anthem, while he stood in a cautious pose.
The military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people gathered in the lecture hall at the main university there to greet him with the slogan "Army and people together".
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorship last year, and swore to take back the presidential powers stripped from the deposed leader by the military council last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court instead of taking the traditional oath of parliament, he bowed to the will of the army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi 's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic popular slogans.

Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases US espionage had crossed the line.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry made the announcement while addressing the Open Government Partnership Annual Summit in London via video link.
I assure you that innocent people are not being harassed in this process.
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in the attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, a key committee of the US Congress has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the public's confidence that has been hurt by the revelation of mass phone tapping.
The Senate move has been welcomed by six US companies including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also raided the data centres of these companies.
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) that cuts the NSA by 11 to 4.
The bill contains several restrictions, including a ban on all phone tapping under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, the use of data by deliberately collecting unauthorized data will be considered a crime and is punishable by 10 years in jail.
The Bill will become law after it passes both Houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The Chairperson of the Committee and Senator Dianne Festine said that the NSA's phone recording program is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the security of the country.
But even so, more transparency should be brought in.
Not only that, but the protection of the public's privacy must also be taken into account.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook, outraged by the revelation of the NSA's Internet surveillance program, have supported the bill.
In a letter to senators, the companies said that they welcome the motion of MPs to curb the NSA's large-scale phone recording.
It is noteworthy that the NSA's actions were uncovered by documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden.
The international community is deeply outraged after the NSA revealed that it had monitored telephone conversations between heads of state of 35 countries, including Germany and France.

A recent media report said that the NSA leaked information from Yahoo and Google data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has made this disclosure based on documents it obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
The NSA program was called Muscular, which it ran in conjunction with its British counterpart, GCHQ, according to the report.
Both agencies stole data passing through the vast fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quotes a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, which says that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just three days of the program's launch.
These include emails, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA gain access to the information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run the program outside the US, as court orders are required for such operations in the US.
NSA chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, "As far as I know, this has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all information within the scope of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration has assured that its communications systems are not being monitored.

In English literature courses students must read at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th - century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction after 1914.
The test will also include "not seen text" to encourage more reading.
A combined English Literature and Language course will be abolished.
From the year 2015, students will have to take a separate GCSE in language, and there will be a lot of motivation to choose English Literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subjects to undergo a revolutionary change.
It will also change other key themes next year.
In a separate step, the examinations will demonstrate changes in the structure of GCSE with regulatory offset, new grading system, and shorter curriculum.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore people's confidence", adding that GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours less a week during the session than in most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, compared to an average of 138 hours in Singapore.
While there would be no formal requirement to give more time to mathematics, the coalition sources said that combining broader mathematics with subjects in the G.C.S.E. - League table for greater weight was likely to encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
The course will focus more on "real world problems" including financial mathematics.

Pawan Bansal, who was surrounded by the opposition's questions at the railway gate, put the opposition in a state of silence by saying that he had not looked at anyone 's woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised at how the woman came to be in the middle.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Turning the matter around, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to get a woman to complain behind him during the last parliamentary election, which failed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said that the CBI has questioned him in the rail bribery case.
If he was made a witness in the case, would he have been made after the full investigation?
Bansal said that he had written a letter to only one person in need in the booth scam he is talking about.
If it is their sin, they will continue to commit it.
He said that although the constitutional right to raise the issue in the Corporation House was not there, he himself asked the opposition to speak.

He also said that he had no other thoughts in mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges must be faced with boldness.
The same expression was on the Chief Minister's face that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to respect the workers in the meditation camp and protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be dismissed from the cabinet to make his point.
Well, after the opinion emerged in the meditative camp, there are signs of a new thinking in the matter of placing workers in government posts.
In the camp, Pradesh JDU President Vishisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of the workers in the 20 Sutri Committees will be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will personally inspect the list from his level.
They will also check whether the MLAs have been consulted in drawing up the list.
If necessary, large scale adjustments will be made to the list to accommodate the old and committed workers.
The common accusation of MLAs - MPs is that their opinion was not taken in the making of the nomination list.
The names of those who came much later from other parties have been entered in the list while many important activists active since the days of the Samaj Party have been neglected.
Some people are born with silver spoons, others make their lives ideal by their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such person is Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, a school teacher in a small village of Chorwad in Gujarat, was born on 28 December 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third of five siblings.
The family includes five children, Ramnikal, Natwar, Dhirubhai and two sisters, Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial hardship, Dhirubhai had to quit his studies after high school.
Dhirubhai had started helping the household financially as a child.
At this time he was running a bakery near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited to the number of tourists coming here.
Dhirubhai 's first job was in 1949 when he arrived in Aden, Yemen, on the ship Kabota at the age of 17.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all arrangements for him, so he had no trouble getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai 's mind.
So in 1954 he returned home.
In 1955, he arrived in Mumbai with 500 rupees in his pocket.
And that's where his career journey started.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani passed away on 6th July 2002.
At that time he owned Rs 62,000 crore.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently holding his sultanate.
Like his father, these two brothers are now among the world's top businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

It is going to be expensive to kill mosquitoes to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, and filaria.
The state government is going to triple the tax on repellents, mats, liquids used in killing mosquitoes.
The proposal for tax increase will be tabled before the Cabinet soon.
The government is struggling with financial crisis and is looking for every possible way to increase its income.

Similarly, the Committee has not given green light to the increase in tax on transmission wire etc. electrical goods at present, saying that this could affect the general public.
The Committee has also not considered the proposal to impose a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: The security of former Minister Ghulam Hassan Khan who joined Congress from the People's Democratic Party has reportedly been removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying that his security has been removed for political reasons.
It is known that Ghulam Hassan Khan Mufti Muhammad Saeed, who won the 2002 elections on the PDP ticket from Shopian, was in his cabinet while he was Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have been in the security arm since 1996.
I live in shopiyas, which are called terrorist strongholds.
A CRPF security team was stationed at my house under the command of a sub-inspector.
I have bodyguards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security team was leaving my house, I spoke to the district deputy commissioner and the district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when approached in this context, IGP of Kashmir Abdul Ghani Mir denied any information on the matter, saying that it is a sensitive matter.
I myself will investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
The Congress chief of the region, Prof. Saifuddin Soj said that there is nothing like this to my knowledge.
If the security of Hassan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am in Jammu at the moment and I am coming to Kashmir in the next couple of days.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs. 8.5 crore during the last four years to commemorate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Contrary to Modi 's claims, during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004) and during the prime ministership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee, there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government for Patel for two consecutive years (2001 - 2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182m-high Statue of Sardar Patel in Kevadiya, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Previously, there was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversaries.
While DAVP records show that UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements for Sardar Patel.
When asked about Modi's claims, Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Manish Tiwari said that BJP PM candidates do not speak on the basis of facts.
The UPA had not been able to bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic downturn that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel 's advertisements is far less than the amount spent on the anniversaries and death anniversaries of the Nehru - Gandhi family members every year.
DAVP spent Rs. 33 crore for the birth and death anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs. 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs. 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs. 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru on print ads.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about this difference, he said, 'It should not be seen in terms of spending on advertising.
Because the price of the advertisement depends on many things, including things like the size of the advertisement or the rate of the advertisement for that year, etc.
The fact is that it shows our dedication, which those who oppose are unwittingly trying to take over the legacy of a great leader.
Today, he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
A week after the blast, the security has been tightly regulated in view of the second visit of Narendra Modi to Patna.
The police scrutinized Modi's travel route and meeting places.
The police will keep an eye on the people who come to the meetings.
The Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will monitor the security.
Modi's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are also being raised about the BJP's Ossi Kalsha Yatra, which was carried out to bring back the dead in the Patna blast.
Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accused the BJP of disturbing the atmosphere.
Moving through soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical services
Dr. Georges Vale is delivering free healthcare to rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not many doctors in West African countries; there is only one doctor for 5,000 people.
Vote here or by mobile
Dr. George Vale is one of CNN's top 10 heroes of the year 2013.
You can vote for him or anyone else in the top 10 to make CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, George Vale had watched his sick father come to and from a hospital, which was not properly equipped to help him.
Jaime Vell was injured in a car accident near Younde, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only a broken arm, but an infection grew that spread to his brain, and it formed a blood clot that affected him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon", says Georges Vale.
If we had money, we would have taken my father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Val took his father around to overcrowded clinics and hospitals and obtained whatever treatment he could.
"It's not easy", said Val.
You leave home at 5 a.m. hoping you'll be the first to arrive at the hospital, but it doesn't happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people may die while waiting.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Val 's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In comparison, there is one physician for every 413 persons in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many Cameroonians cannot afford them.
Two in five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost two thirds of the healthcare expenditure in the country is in the private sector.
"Their only problem is poverty", says Vail.
And because they are poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Val was determined to do something about it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries in the past year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Younde.
And he started the non-profit organization EskoWim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical services.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 others sit in vans, strap medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical care.
Sometimes luck is not even on their side.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they get the real heroes' honour: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
The free medical care in these villages is a cause for celebration indeed, and the Wel - with its big smile and endless energy - adds to the joy.
The next morning his team starts to meet hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each trip", said Val.
They come from about 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get a mattress, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- documents that are required in school but many poor families cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with local anesthesia.
The operations are usually performed in school buildings, town halls or at home; after the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery area, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator illuminates the operating room and the sanitizing equipment, and the whale and his volunteers get up early on Sunday mornings.
It is a slow pace, but the village musicians usually help keep the party motivated.
"They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and keep their work going", said Vale.
On Sunday, his team returns to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
The group - which includes Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students - has performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world of those they help.
One person reported that he would be able to return to work due to receiving free hernia surgery.
The man said, "This will change my future and my family's".
Besides running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Val also works at night in a private medical clinic around Younde.
He said that this is his second job which finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is done by private donations.
"I don't know when they sleep", said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Well's group.
They're always either in the hospital, or trying to raise money for their organization to keep these campaigns going.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Vale's campaign, this is a pilot opportunity they could never have in their own country.
"We've been able to gain experimental experience in surgeries where we've helped Dr. Weil with tools or cleaning up blood stains", said O'Malley.
As a second year medical student in the United States, you will never get the opportunity to do that.
Student volunteers typically pay their own way to reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after arriving at Yaounde, their stay and instructions are well paid for.
"There's no doubt they are heroes", says O'Malley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon will never end.
For the well, almost the same workload, no difficulty.
Helping others to live a happy life, fulfilling a promise made to their father, these are the things that give them great joy.
"I'm very happy doing this", says Val.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I 'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

You may not believe it, but it is true.
Not only that, the Mission Road has been named after the City Council President Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuvam Morcha has named it to express its displeasure over some of the city 's badly run streets.
The event was led by the Union Secretary of JAMMO, Sachidanand Pandey.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You look at the speeches of Congress or sect leaders in the last two months, you will find that they do not talk about what they have done".
"Congress has become so arrogant that it doesn't answer questions from the media", he said.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs answers from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Obviously, Modi was responding to Sibal who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wanted a controlled environment where he would give his speech and not talk to the journalists to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to argue face to face.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year", Modi said.
The Congress has re-ticketed all the old MLAs.
The list includes 6 old and 2 new faces.
The new faces include Nirmala Sapre from Bina Assembly constituency of Sagar district and Pratap Singh Lodhi from Jabera Assembly constituency of Damoh district.
Three from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one from Chhatarpur have been re-ticketed.

Sachidanand Worship, a contender from Raipur North seat, has been made the election conductor of Raipur Rural seat.
The worshippers have been asked to handle the State office and visit anywhere in the State if necessary.
The election of several officers including the State President Ram Sevak Pakra and the Chief Minister Shivartan Sharma has left the Union Chief Minister Ram Pratap alone.
For this reason, worship has been given a great responsibility.
RDA President Sunil Soni, who is the contender from the North seat, has been given the responsibility of conducting the Raipur South seat.
Another claimant, Sanjay Srivastava, has been placed on the Provincial Reception Committee.
He will help in the transportation of the party 's star propagandists, the national leaders.
The committee also has some other ticket contenders including Sony.
Shyam Basarang seat and Leelaram Bhojwani will conduct the elections for Rajnandgaon seat.
The association organised a colorful event.
In the Diwali programme, singer Hargun added four moons to the beauty of the ceremony with his songs.
The Diwali, which was led by Bar Advocate Pradeep Saini, was attended by judges, Bar Association officials and lawyers.
District and Sessions Judge Harminder Singh Madan said that festivals of all religions should be celebrated together in the country.
Bar Advocate Pradeep Saini, Chairman, said that all festivals are celebrated with great fervor and enthusiasm by the Bar Association every year without any discrimination.
Hundreds of devotees were present on the occasion.
On the occasion of Mahavira Jayanti, Lord Hanuman was worshiped at Devica Beach.

He said that a huge bandagare was organized after Havan Yajna with the cooperation of the city residents, in which people of all religions of the city received the blessings by receiving the Prasad.
Obama's health care proposal withdrawn
Amidst a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his oft-repeated deceptive promise that "if you like your health plan, you can continue it".
With millions of people receiving termination notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday Obama changed his actual message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and it's useful, they can keep it".
Addressing what he calls the "news flash" of the cancellation, Obama has graciously bought new coverage in the marketplace from American citizens who receive this information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, for the same amount of money or even cheaper than the offer.
He said, "You'll get a better deal".
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that the 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans as their coverage does not meet the standards desired under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said, "I say to these American citizens, 'You deserve better.'
Sebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
"I am just as frustrated and angry as everyone else", he said.
I want to win your trust again.
After a sharp knockdown with the Republicans yesterday at the House hearing, Sebelius angrily told a fellow sitting behind him, who was grabbed by a microphone, Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.
A case of ransom of Rs. 2 lakh was sought from the trader.
The daughter has been threatened to be taken away if she does not pay.
The case registered at Hudkeswar Police Station is being tried to be solved with the help of Cyber Crime Cell.
Narendra Bahar (21) from Ayodhya is the owner of the electronics shop.
Between 25 and 29th, someone called from different mobile numbers on his mobile.
The caller demanded two lakh rupees as ransom.
Narendra is threatened with death or with the kidnapping of his daughter if he does not.
Narendra did not take this threat seriously at first, but when the threats began to escalate and the subject came to his daughter, who was studying in class XII, he became upset.
The family members are in fear.
A complaint was lodged on Thursday.
No leads have been found yet.
The Cyber Crime Cell is being called in to assist in the severity of the case.
Apart from this, MP Badal directed the officials to address the problems of the people by holding a congregational meeting in villages of Bhagivander, Bander Patti, Laleyana, Jjal, Phullo Khari, Gatwali and Malkana.
The MP also released grants for the development of villages.
He directed the Panchayat to make proper use of the grant issued for the development of the villages so that the facilities are available to the villagers. He reviewed the arrangements for the purchase of paddy in the village Bhagivander.
He gave sewing machines, plants and certificates to 15 girls who had received sewing training.
During this time 400 Congress and PPP members in village Bhagivander, 35 Congress and PPP members in Laleyana and 71 families in village Jal left the Congress and PPP and joined the Shiromani Akali Dal.
Badal said that Punjab farmers are being humiliated at the mandis due to the parameters set by the Centre regarding the procurement of paddy, while the Centre has always been biased towards the Punjab farmer.
He was accompanied by D.C. KK Yadav, S.S.P. Ravcharan Singh Barad, A.D.C. D.Sonali Giri, A.D.C. Rajiv Parashar, S.D.M. Shruti Sharma, Area Inchart of Talwandi Sabo, Balvir Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk, as well as administrative officers and senior leaders from various departments.
As a result, the number of violations of the Code of Conduct has been reduced.
Since the Election Code of Conduct came into force on 4th October, 313 cases were registered against various political parties till 21st October.
From 22 to 27 October, only 31 cases have been reported.
With the introduction of the Election Code of Conduct, there were also cases of violations.
In the early days, there were more complaints, but gradually it started to decline.
It is being reported that in the early days, the lack of full knowledge about the Code of Conduct was causing more complaints against political parties.
The Election Commission has been making political parties aware and learning from the case, which has led to fewer complaints.
Many parties were campaigning as before for lack of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are complying with the Election Code of Conduct.
This is also reducing the number of violations.
A proposal has been sent to the administration by the ADA in this regard, which is going to be signed soon.
This historic city, surrounded by Ganga and Yamuna on three sides, no longer has any land on which the ADA could plan a large housing estate.
In this context, it is now intended to plan housing further east than Jhansi, further north than Fafamo and further south than Nani.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Rajshekhar to give a comprehensive outline of the plan.
The ADA has envisaged to include 200 revenue villages of Phulpur, Soaraon and Karchna.
After coming within the boundaries of ADA, the Chaca and Bahadur blocks will be abolished.
Half of the Kaudhihar block will also be merged into the ADA.
According to Amarnath Upadhyay, Secretary of ADA, a proposal has been sent to the administration.
The ADA wants to take the boundaries of these Gram Panchayats under its jurisdiction for planning, which will be started soon.
If this happens, the rising cost of buildings in the city will be reduced.
At the same time, housing will be easily available to the common people.
Soon residential buildings will be erected in this new area, on the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

The human population has crossed the 7 billion mark.
If the population continues to grow like this, the time will soon come when it will be difficult to get food for every hungry mouth.
Experts believe that in the near future, humans will have no choice but to eat insects.
A group of students from McGill University in Montreal reportedly won the Hult Prize for a unique project this year.
He has been awarded for making protein flour from insects.
They have been awarded a grant of 1 million dollars to further their research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30, the group's chief student researcher, Mohammad Ashur, said that his team will now experiment on locusts for food.
The report contains detailed information on edible insect spiders.

This time, Asaram, who is in judicial custody at the Central Jail here on charges of sexual assault of a minor student, will celebrate Diwali in jail.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused of rape of a girl from Surat.
Meanwhile, his son Narayan Sai has been running from the police.
And so now an arrest warrant has been issued against him by the Gujarat Police.
It is also reported from Ahmedabad that the trustees of Asaram have also started to step aside from Asaram.
Apart from this, action is also being taken against Ashrams which are built illegally or on government land.
As we have already told you, Asaram owns more than 400 ashrams.
One of these ashrams is in New Jersey, USA.
There are various allegations against Asaram and his son.
Even so, the superstition of many of his devotees is not abating.
Asaram has a dominant position not only in India but also in the United States.
Here in India, Asaram may be in prison and devotees are increasingly fleeing him, but in America, it is not so.
In the New Jersey Ashram, devotees are still visiting the Ashram as before.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that U.S. intelligence "has gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry has hinted at a softening of the U.S. protective stance on its surveillance program by unexpectedly admitting that at times its spying "goes too far inappropriately".
The Minister of State has also admitted that he is guilty along with Barack Obama of being on "automatic pilot" as a rebellious revelation to whistleblower Edward Snowden about the exposure of NSA spying activities.
The revelation has caused the U. S. government to undergo a diplomatic upheaval in its relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, myself, and others in the government were really aware of some of the things that were happening with the autopilot, because looking back, World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, of course, 9/11 had its potential.
He has become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage has crossed its limits, but to insist that no one's rights have been abused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately".
And the President is determined to try to make this clear to the people and is now conducting a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed that, however, the NSA was working for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He added: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up".
There is radical extremism in the world, determined to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
So what's the problem if you can stop it before it happens?
We have actually saved the plane from crashing, the buildings from collapsing, and the people from being killed because we were able to know about the other person's plans in advance.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers would travel to Europe to help address concerns overseas about so-called U.S. spying, and to try to convince European countries of the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he has spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about threats to stop them from participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to the National Security Agency's lack of oversight.
"It is really important to U.S. national security interests that European countries be with us in the context of our counterterrorism efforts", said Murphy, the first-time Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, in an interview with Washington.
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations from Europe have brought bitterness to relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the agency's head said the reports were not entirely accurate, and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United Nations.
Other revelations in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA has monitored the cell phones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence, defended the alleged spying on allies as necessary and said it was common practice for both sides to do so.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional trip that was likely to take place this year, and he hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and both chambers.
The names of other lawmakers participating will be released in the coming days.
He said that the itinerary is still being worked on.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said that some "impractical relations" would also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their people, and with their espionage programs that have been used for years.
"While we can revise our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying", Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carey is scheduled to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will address scholarly issues ranging from U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran to U.S. surveillance activities.
A new policy of board change has been initiated in the municipalities.
Recently, the Board of Councillors of the Congress - led party in the Saithiya Municipality of Virbhum district was transformed into the Board of Trinamool.
This change was due to the majority of the Congress councillors including the Municipal Chairman joining Trinamool.
Not only the Congress but also some councillors of the MAKPA, Bhakpa and Forward Bloc have also taken up the repression of Trinamool here.
The Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai considers this a good sign for the party.
He said that 10 Congress councillors including the Chairman of Sainthiya Municipality, Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta joined Trinamool.
Some of the councillors of the Left Front, including the Makpa, have also taken up the Trinamool flag.
All have informed the District Magistrate in writing under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of Trinamool and according to the number of the force, the Saithiya Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, MCP, BJP, and Forward Bloc are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.
Qualified leaders of any party are welcome at Trinamool.
The takeover of the Municipal Board by Trinamool due to the change of party of Congress councillors in the Municipality of Saithiya ahead of the elections of the five municipalities on 22nd November is being considered important in political circles.
The previous example of Trinamool taking over the Congress - ruled Municipal Board is in the left - ruled Haldiya and Nadia.
When the Trnmool is taken over by a change of party in the Municipal Boards in the districts, those who join the party are given a grand welcome at the Trnmool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Roy is excited about the leaders joining Trinamool by breaking away from other parties.
He says that those who come from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
He claims that the people's confidence is growing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, which has resulted in people wanting to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party, the Makpa, says that the lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the TNCC in fear of terror.
The MACPA considers the change in the boards of elected local bodies as a blow to democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to increase its vote but the justification of changing the power is questionable.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney has been sentenced to 15 days in jail in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assault, has appealed against the decision and has been granted bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bamford guilty of making false accusations against Thai police, alleging that a local taxi driver, along with two other individuals, had tried to stop him on the morning of Sunday, June 10.
But later CCTV footage revealed that she had returned safely to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
After being interrogated for two days by Phuket police, Bamfort admitted to making up the story.
He was held in the local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has petitioned the Department of Foreign Affairs in Canberra to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very concerned" about the care of their daughter and wanted to call her back to Australia.
