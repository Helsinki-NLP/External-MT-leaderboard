White bread, please.
White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black pawn on h4 - mat!
White: boats on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: boats on a7 and b7, king on a8, elephant on b8. White puts the opponent in a juggling position, placing the boat on a6, after which black has only two options: take the boat on a6 or move the elephant to any other field of the b8-h2 diagonal. In the first case, white moves the pawn from b6 to b7 and puts the mat. In the second case, white boat takes the black pawn on a7 with the same result.
