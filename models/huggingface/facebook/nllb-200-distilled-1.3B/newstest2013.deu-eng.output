A Republican strategy to oppose Obama's reelection
The Republican leadership justifies its policies with the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, affirming that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in the last 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for conducting elections in each state.
In this regard, most American governments have since 2009 enacted new laws that make it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone that restrict the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the time limits for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and deny citizens the right to vote, for which there is a judicial record.
Before the 2006 election, no state in the United States required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they've been promoting bills in 34 states that require voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the Health Insurance Card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens, or 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, it is often more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those with incomes under $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes further.
Students who are considered voters and who are more likely to vote for democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more for the Republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs for elections.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Because it's obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, in 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states passed legislation that eliminated voter registration on Election Day.
You have also restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped register some 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of new voter registration in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed legislation aimed at shortening the time period for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-American, even though they make up only 13% of the state's voters.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of those who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes by Democratic governors.
The attorney general of the United States has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws passed and see them as a clear goal to influence the results in the states that will determine 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that those states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral legislation will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the democratic system of the United States.
Early detection of prostate cancer: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test does indeed sometimes give erroneous results, with false negatives or false positives leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater reluctance among already undecided men to undergo early detection tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We've got two specialists.
In the US studies, there were numerous interferences between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that, on follow-up after 12 years, the likelihood of metastasis is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection is performed.
That's why I recommend testing at age 50 or 40, if you have a direct relative who already has prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at a higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made to really understand the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options for not treating prostate cancer if it does not affect his quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, he is more likely to opt for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life-threatening.
They are suggested to be actively monitored and treated if the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not are being determined with increasing precision.
That's why I still recommend that you run the test.
Most important, though, is to talk to your doctor about whether it should be done.
Movember has developed a tool in collaboration with the International Society of Urology to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30 percent of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised enough.
"If there were no smokers, this number would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Several are still completely unsolved.
The Canadian Cancer Society continues to make the fight against tobacco addiction a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It's also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is very damaging to people's health.
"Today there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying of cancer is cut in half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease's onset.
They seem to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer", he adds.
The diet
The organization also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too large a quantity, it increases the risk of developing colon and rectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer", he explains.
Other
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But their findings are not conclusive at this time.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"The early detection test does not lead to cancer".
The Higgs boson is being analyzed.
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it's believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it's the last particle that the Standard Model predicted would exist -- our best or least-false explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it's not yet entirely certain that this is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be absolutely sure.
But let's assume that it's actually the Higgs, because there seems to be a small risk of being wrong, and let's look at what it is.
There is a law in this world that is inevitable and inevitable, which means that two objects cannot be in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and don't try too hard, because you will get hurt.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that it also has a law like this: the Pauli exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", where that "state" is largely made up of some of their properties.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, known as fermions, who politely obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other one, the bosons are moving, a vicious gang of anarchists who have nothing sacred -- certainly not this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the Berkeley Laboratories website The Particle Adventure, which is absolutely amazing, are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we won't discuss here, and the "force particles" that are the way the great forces of nature are spread and that the Higgs boson is somehow related to.
But it's important to note here that these bosons aren't all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only because of a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "particle of light", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
That is, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disrupted" at that very spot, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "interference" creates an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of the force".
More stable field
The same thing applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, has to be "disrupted" for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the agent must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be cut by a very large rock.
So a giant particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 kilometers! - is needed to achieve such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
It is not all particles and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never stick on the refrigerator by itself.
And equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What good can all this research be, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they are used to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to study accurately any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the SM.
There are, by the way, many physicists who are desperate to find such discrepancies, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and fill some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter has still major flaws, as it does not offer an explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (again ups!).
However, no such deviations have been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there is none.
By the way, in the early '60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Labs had no idea that their work would spark such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who even developed the first continuous-flow laser in 1962 - told us that the laser was initially seen as more of a "laboratory toy".
Can you imagine?
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle, while working in optics, developed a small light sensor.
Although not its original purpose, this sensor now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras worldwide, and it won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care is the best way to die...
With its committee on "Dying with Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of the end of life.
The debate must resume soon, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. was living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was eating him up had given him two years to live.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven", he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois hospice in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it", he says.
The disease is doing its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating by himself.
Sitting at the table at a delicious lunch, he resignedly agrees to help with the meal.
He even manages to smile and talk to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea be cured, because it is humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"We all experience standing up to pee", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Returning to the childhood phase is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step back", he says.
Because according to several people who work in palliative care, big events are happening in the midst of these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois hospice are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the so-called "healing" care of the doctors and nurses who care for them.
For 89-year-old A., the worst fear is "knowingly and suffocatingly".
But through the illness, I really got to know my kids.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no more desires in life", she says before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still expecting a last visit from her son, who is coming from Italy.
The Victor-Gadbois Home is a group of volunteers who provide care and assistance with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That's a small price to pay when you consider that we're all going to die one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Both on the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given a mouthwash with brandy or Pepsi, depending on his wishes.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar.
And death is part of life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, and he died during the night.
This morning, his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike", says Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
At the Victor-Gadbois home, every day is different.
Next to a 93-year-old man enjoying the last family gathering in the yard, well supported by his pillow as a toast is to his honor, a 36-year-old man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months now, three to five beds have been filled with cancer patients under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel, worried.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois' home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, which is care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when they reach the end of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Home and the Palliative Care Society in the Greater Montreal area, specialize more or less exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this serious inadequacy in Quebec's health care system that has caused several palliative care doctors to be apprehensive about the passage of a law regulating assisted dying and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent figures in palliative care such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not capable of ensuring that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting assisted dying.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in the emergency room for 14 days with severe pain and no relief was given.
I'm afraid the only reason patients want to die is because they don't get proper health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are treating their patients with the utmost persistence until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped a cumbersome course of chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she said that she regretted giving up the fight, she told me.
But she told me I was finished!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not granting their wish after their pain is alleviated by a palliative care team.
It must be made clear, however, that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Society of Home Palliative Care in Greater Montreal, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which involves putting the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of death.
We can no longer pretend not to see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option of resorting to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain relieved".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale property scandal in Quebec
Every day, officials from the road office, construction companies, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell what they know about a grand "system" involving the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An industry that was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system is falling apart since drastic measures were taken", jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was exposed by him as a result of an in-depth investigation into the embezzlement of contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, secret party financing and bribing of officials.
"Since the inquiry began in 2010", he points out, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts" because some people were using their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping to "discover the tactics behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit set up in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And the police of the "Marteau troop", which since 2009 has made the Montreal "sewage cartel" more restrained in the artificial inflation of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of having repeatedly accepted bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The specific charges against the engineers of the Montreal Road Building Authority, as well as Italian entrepreneurs, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were specifically mentioned.
The latter has made a splash by explaining to the Commission how the 'system' for obtaining public contracts works.
He himself paid 3% of the value of contracts he won in Montreal for several years to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has been involved throughout the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 to provincial parties, mainly the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising illegal fundraising for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Plumbing contracts for which he artificially inflated the cost
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail to the Commission: over a period of ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, and bribes of $736,000 from the construction company in exchange for plumbing contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials in the road office admitted that they had been defrauded by artificially inflating the bills for false benefits by 30-40%.
In addition, a promoter of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately ignoring a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal deputies to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she fought back in 2010 against the sale of a municipal property that was bought for $5 million and sold for $1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
She says that the investigation that is finally conducted "pulls a thread that allows us to understand the workings of the system that ants have undermined in order to stop the evil and expose the culprits".
She says the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we need a Montreal-only investigation unit and a monitoring unit to prevent a return to questionable practices.
How to clean.
I'm going to be regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "officials who know about the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Based on a 70% black money contribution to Quebec's campaign financing, he jokes: "I was told that this was just a faint blur of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100, which he says will not change the situation: "Until campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in the political arena".
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system of public procurement and party funding: "We cannot fall any lower; by courageously getting to the bottom of things, we can rebuild the house on a more solid foundation with more controls and legislation".
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken PSG to a new level.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players came.
I'm making progress every day by her side.
The technical staff gave me a lot too.
These elements motivate me to improve my level of play every day.
And in a game, it's even easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not going to burst into excitement.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine Preparatory Training Centre to my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
They are thus taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The newcomers this summer are used to hosting games of a very high standard.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This means that a player like me has to face it and try his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of credit for my position.
He's backed by co-coaches like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course I can.
Ancelotti instills respect in all the technicians.
There is no one like him in Ligue 1 at the moment, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The confidence he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon has taken our place as the leader.
But we're in the middle of an ambush.
One of our main objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified for the quarter-finals in this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have to say our piece against very good European teams.
First, we want to be first in our group before Porto, so we can play the rematch of the last eight at home.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for that...
To become a major European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is giving itself the financial means to make this project concrete.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as happened last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
We were close last season.
In May, we were disappointed because we were strong enough to carry the victory away.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be champion with 79 points...
But another team, the Montpelliers, had an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I believe we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Given what's been invested and the players we have, it's only natural that a lot is expected of us.
We totally accept that.
But when we win 4-0 at home to Troyes and they still find something to blame us for, it's certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what people are waiting for.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put together a game concept.
A team builds over time.
We showed our strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the last eight for two seasons and which has also spent enormous sums!
In terms of the sums invested, you were thought to be 15 points ahead at halftime!
That would mean ignoring our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties we have won it in the end.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performance of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So much better that it's called a "Zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is a very good player, scoring a lot of goals.
That's why he's here, and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he's played, he's made it clear that he's a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those around him.
What he's done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, is making it possible for everyone else to progress as well.
How did you experience the 2012 European Championships with the French national team?
It's like a disappointment.
I wanted to go to this Olympics.
Unfortunately, my injury has prevented me from getting some playing time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned from what has happened in Ukraine and we must be exemplary today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first months at the helm of the Blues?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and motivates them to win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championships.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the forced draw (1:1) in Spain on 16 October a preliminary game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone stood up for everyone else.
I've never seen a match like this before this meeting in Spain.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties involved.
Moreover, as so often happens, these technologies have a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows direct file exchange.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment.
After reaching a high of $30 in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies such as "credits" used to advance in a video game, which can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged) by playing.
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
However, the trade is always controlled and handled by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction shall be electronically signed by a double-encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the bitcoins traded are in the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to enter this new transaction into this ledger.
This is done via a mathematical task that is run on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, having the privilege of adding this extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and more distinct electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing gets "hacked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user tries to pay twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money for fraud, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward will be regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is limited to 21 million, but it can be divided up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some room for...
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used is not the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse to donate this kind of money.
Others, like the blogging platform WordPress, are accepting them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega-sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", says Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who also wrote a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His Paytunia system is similar to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by traders without the need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who says he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards the abandonment of hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to gain traction, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB's report also envisages reassessing the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of a success of this currency.
We pulled out of Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their areas of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back control of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan farmers in particular by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 dead soldiers, as well as the wounded and injured.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajik have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will be no more as Western countries become more discreet.
The French troops' withdrawal from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from a hill covered with almond trees, financed by French loans, was orderly.
The convoys of trucks and tanks, overflown by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflow into Kabul.
Since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996, conditions have changed.
At that time, Kabul was empty and the country was engulfed in war due to the fighting of the various rebel groups.
Their rise to power was seen at the time as a sort of liberation and return to security.
The Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban share a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures in the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned themselves into businessmen by seizing government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, thus benefiting from massive American subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as have those who have benefited from American aid: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world, and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65 percent of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the public schools are full of girls as well as boys.
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet decided on the future of the programme.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television with its Turkish series depicting a modern world is watched everywhere.
We have an army now.
Will the authorities under whose authority it will be placed be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to re-establish the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization following the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential powers.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950's and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are not available and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan had immense natural resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to take over.
Mining is not possible without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site or transportation for export over the mountains.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine, have international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's main employers.
The Commission is also aware of the fact that the Commission has not yet received any information on the situation in Afghanistan.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: grammar schools for girls and boys, the French Institute at the universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (CIMIC), which was disbanded in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit works and agricultural rehabilitation measures in dozens of mountain villages, and was commissioned by a small French NGO to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These works, which required a large number of local workers, helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increasing agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after spending two billion euros on the military?
A much smaller budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes of over 2000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small farming projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
The farmers' desire to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups would require the continuation of less, better controlled and directly affecting civilian aid to their benefit.
A Constitution with a Crutch in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever over the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it unlimited power, he has decided to put everything on the map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
The President of the Council has just given this Parliament two months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text, amended several times, for almost two years now, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal chaos.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division in the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law".
The European Union is also committed to the development of a common defence policy.
The European Parliament has a duty to ensure that the European Parliament is informed of the results of the elections.
A very short period of time, forcing the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians, section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
According to confirmations in an interview with the American weekly magazine Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
The Egyptian people are being given an ultimatum by this rush vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I keep the unlimited authority", which should be ended after the constitution is adopted.
The 85 members of this constituent assembly, most of them Islamists, passed the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they turned away, feeling that they had not been able to make their views known.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities and civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to achieve the decision-making power, 11 people were added as alternates yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were mostly adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not working correctly.
The text adopted last night contains 234 articles.
Article 2, which drew all attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a proof of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
The Liberal Group has called this a "hypocrisy" and has regarded it as a propaganda attack.
Because they say the Islamization of the constitution is done through other articles.
They have in particular Article 220 in mind, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, particularly in relation to verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are asked to comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the first signs of a theocracy here".
The fears of the liberals are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At present, there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema but academics, some of whom were trained in the French system", says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, it admits that "there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
This refers in particular to fiqh.
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges have jurisdiction to decide on this matter".
The text adopted yesterday has been heavily criticised for its religious aspect and for the wide-ranging powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention is the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Nor will there be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the human rights groups have called for.
The latter also expressed their concerns about the text, which they considered to be a threat to freedom.
The fact that blasphemy is still being committed and that insults are now prohibited could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, no article is any longer about protecting women, stresses Heba Morayev of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point, in your view, is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to make a televised speech last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the glory of Bible truths, modern conveniences, and pristine nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
And those who bow down before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles - turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on water, calming a storm, and catching fish.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
Most of the shrines, however, are in Jerusalem.
The faithful walk the way of suffering or the way of the cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The road starts at the Roman fortress of Antonia, the Praetorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone, and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for the Jews - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of various faiths leave wishes on the walls of the temple, which are then fulfilled.
Taking a Trip to the Heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They lie on a rocky outcrop in the mountains, 450 meters above sea level.
Only mountaineers can reach the ruins by their own power.
Everyone else will be taken by a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600 to 2,040 meters, is the famous Hermon ski resort, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
You can get there by shuttle bus from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain top.
Visiting Unique Museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
One trip alone cannot see them all.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be given a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in caves in the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection of works by the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso is exhibited there.
In Akko, you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of ancient Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally declined.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of history's most shocking chapters.
The most moving section is the Children's Monument, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were exterminated in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, it's completely dark.
The stars are twinkling.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries where they died are ringing.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Doing Something for Health
The three main recreation areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red and the Dead Seas.
Each of the three locations has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, bathing in the Red Sea is also possible during the winter months, since the water temperature does not fall below 70 degrees Fahrenheit [21°C] and the air warms up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [23°C].
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed all year round.
Incidentally, this unusual sea, at 1,300 feet [417 m] below sea level, is the deepest in the world.
Its turquoise-blue waters are highly saline, making it easy for even non-swimmers to surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments with salt water (natural salt salt) and medicinal sludge, as well as for skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, and to calm strained nerves.
The Secrets of Antiquity Touch
These are the secrets of Tel Aviv's Old City, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and it was here that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after star signs.
Fortune is said to be the hero of the legend after all who touch the walls in the alley with their star sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries on photo dates.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater and capture the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater now hosts evening concerts and operas.
List of tourist attractions
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
Instead of taking euros, travelers prefer to take dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
The city is mostly reached by bus, but there is also a tram line in Jerusalem and the only subway line in Haifa, with six stations, connecting the lower city to the upper city.
It's actually an underground cable car.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough including a change of car for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed in Israel on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed and public transportation is suspended.
And Sunday morning is the start of the workweek.
Many cafes, restaurants, and restaurants serve only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without shells, and foods containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of dishes including mutton and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, fried balls of mashed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For that, there are many well-fed cats that roam the streets comfortably and unmolested.
At night, they can even be seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an extra $15 a day.
And the rent is 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
In figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money on language
While MPs and civil rights activists debate the benefits of the law on compulsory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading in fake certificates
Each year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support their families back home.
On December 1, a law came into force that requires every migrant worker to pass a test that certifies knowledge of the Russian language.
The scheme is currently only available to migrants who wish to work in the service sector, the municipal housing sector and the retail trade.
However, in time, the Federal Migration Agency says that the tests will become mandatory for all guest workers.
It is not only a question of language tests, but also of Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both obtaining and renewing a work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law also exempts persons who obtained their diplomas and certificates before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
The meaning, problems and protection of rights
The examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Russian University of International Friendship, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
The migrants can take the tests in all cities, and more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question in the press several times before the law came into force: What is the point of this?
What changes does the requirement to have a language proficiency bring for both Russians and foreign workers?
The main aim, according to Migration Agency spokesmen, is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many people are talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers", says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without jobs, education, language skills and medical examination face problems.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions who, under the pretext of helping, will put him in a dark, cramped barracks, where he will endure with dozens of his peers for months without food and documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"At home you are promised one thing, and when you arrive you are cheated, your passports are taken away and you do not get the promised salary", confirms Tolib Shwaripov, head of the Tajik Migration Agency's main labour migration department.
Don't you swear, boss!
Yet many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to earn money in Russia admit that they not only do not speak the language of the country of destination but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even a reasonable basic education.
Because their families do not even have the money to feed their children, let alone to buy decent clothes, shoes, and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children then immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
Civil rights experts emphasize the following important aspect of the law.
Only legal immigrants are required to take the test.
If you do not have this status, you will not take the exam and therefore not get an official job.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers continue to stay in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "No unauthorized access"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be made quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
The Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", Umed Khushkadamov, a Tajik, told reporters.
"Just don't be afraid of the cost of false papers"
The day the law came into force, it became clear that not only the immigrants' registration documents could be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the passing of the language test have already been seized by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The forged papers were printed with a regular inkjet printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for free: Every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that certificates cannot be bought easily, both officials and civil rights groups agree.
For the time being, the authorities can only promise that guest workers who fail the test the first time will be given time for a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Home Office ignores illegal arms trade
Very low proportion of legal weapons in crime
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the gun law for private gun owners.
The authorities are responding to recent events, including the shooting of a wedding party and the death of seven people in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
Police are planning to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age of ownership from 18 to 21.
The proposal was supported by the chairwoman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Law will be submitted to the Duma soon.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "pulling the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various arms unions - call on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening".
The percentage of registered gun crimes is very low, criminal lawyer Wasilij Lesnikov told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes involving registered weapons were committed during the six months of 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not stop criminals from using the black market.
According to the authors, at present, any weapon is available in Moscow for a small fee.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry is stressing that the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons are being trafficked through several channels to the black market.
There are five such main channels, says former colonel Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts weapons orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen both by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves", says Baranez.
On channel two, illegal weapons are being stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from police weapons rooms and directly from law enforcement officers.
Other illegal weapons are from military stockpiles.
Explosions were frequent at many military camps.
"There is evidence that in some cases arson was used to cover up the lack of weapons", says the former military man.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore waste their weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow", reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia that organizes the smuggling", explains the former military man.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in the supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Office for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons come from the army and law enforcement agencies, according to investigators.
Half of all guns on the black market are "the fault of officials who have been involved in the business of weapons", says the report.
The researchers' data show that 17% of the weapons come from conflict zones, 14% come from theft in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A salesman at an arms store who did not want to be named says that weapons found during illegal excavations have long since been outdated and no one buys them.
He said it's more common for dealers to get their supplies from a weapons depot.
An ensign buys a weapon, for example a TT pistol.
The weapon is being held and passed through the fence.
"The dealer takes the gun into town and sells it for 900 euros a piece with two magazines", he says.
"The police are of course aware of everything and, therefore, when they cannot follow the plan to detect crimes, they periodically inspect the purchases from dealers who sell illegal weapons", adds the salesman.
"Like in a high-end store"
Buyers and sellers are most likely to find each other through acquaintances.
I was looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the station "Begowaja", where a person would be waiting for me and take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I didn't know the price of the gun until I was there.
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts", says the salesman. "I have an acquaintance who does, but I don't trust him".
There are vendors in the markets, but you have to go there and make an appointment with a code like "from Ivan Ivanovich, who sends word that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I'm even getting some rings from a friend I trust.
He's only giving me the rings because he knows I won't rat him out.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranez tried to sell illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
He said the patterns haven't changed.
He was given a photo album that depicted "anything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the military man.
Baranez says the buyer doesn't get the cat in the bag, but can try anything.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy, but I drive with the seller into the woods, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and when I'm sure the gun has a good shot, we negotiate", the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the couch
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte" where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are required, and no personal meetings are held.
"You just need the right amount of money", says the ad on the "Buy a Fighting Pistol or Rifle" website.
It's where users place their orders and make requests.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", user "Ivan" asks.
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of "Fyodorkov".
The Federal Security Service recently shut down a number of fake websites, and buyers looking to buy guns are turning to the service.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then end up in Siberia and get to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military man Viktor Baranez
I heard about the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The people in charge take orders.
The buyer transfers the money through an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of where the gun is hidden", reports Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the nonprofit organization "Pravo na oryzhie".
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can end up empty-handed and behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently shut down a number of fake websites, and buyers looking to buy guns are turning to the service.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then end up in the Siberian labor camp and get to shovel coal", he says.
A Makarov for $100
Experts say that buying illegal firearms can cost from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", a Makarov-type pistol can be purchased for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military arsenals by middle-ranking supervisors.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons decreased by 7% to 22,9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011 throughout Russia, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the United States
One in four American teenagers is behind the counter at McDonald's at some point.
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further or if they will soon run out of air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-leaning non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are aiming to form unions.
So far, this sector of the economy has hardly been organized in a union.
Forty-six cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, when there were sales in the United States that attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to hand-to-hand combat.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of which there are 2.2 million worldwide, quit their jobs and joined with unions and left-wing activists to strike at the chain's branches, which target low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to shotguns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The goods in Walmart stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees only shop at their workplace.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say that the only reason Walmart can often sell its goods so cheaply is that its employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of harsh working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded wage increases and expressed anger that the company's health insurance premium had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour couldn't afford that raise, they said.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, have shown that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they're giving for wages now.
If Walmart were to pass the wage increases on to its customers, it would cost only 46 cents more per purchase.
That would be an extra $12.39 a year for them compared to today's expenditures.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that protests were held in only nine states and did not cause the company any losses.
Black Friday lasted in his store from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart's cash registers performed almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Walmart spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that "less than five" Walmart employees quit altogether and that the protest was merely "another PR stunt" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are undesirable and therefore nonexistent in this progressive city), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York state law is $7.25 an hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually raising the minimum wage, but not too much, and their average New York City employee is making $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive town makes less than she does.
I can't understand how you can live in New York with so little money.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American teenagers were at McDonald's after school, but they were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as their main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, when I interview McDonald's employees, I keep meeting people who complain that they live off that salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a commentary in the Wall Street Journal commented that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters, who began outside McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast-food restaurants be paid a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than doubling the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of unions in the fast food industry.
The United States law prohibits corporate management from interfering with this goal and from reprimanding or firing union members.
On the other hand, management does not make things easy for them.
The creation of trade unions in the fast food sector is also difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high turnover of staff.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The protest culminated in a midday rally outside McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you don't get paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayor's candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support fast food workers so they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, only a few hundred people were on the scene, not all of whom work in the fast food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain can only be outsmarted to a limited extent"
The subject of augmented reality, popular with modern technology enthusiasts, is now usually seen through the lens of special glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technologies group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Shahram Izadi, it is clear that the glasses were only a transitory stop for the company's scientists.
It is fascinating to be able to manipulate virtual objects in the air with your bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We are concerned with human-machine interaction, but we want to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity has mostly been stuck in the phase where we work with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
But we want to look five to ten years ahead and see the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox consoles and the Kinect sensors are a breakthrough, and nowadays, no Xbox is sold without the Kinect, because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much of it still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, the output not so far decisive.
We're trying to change that, by working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projection.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
This requires that the user is recognised as well as his environment.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid VR helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not a one-size-fits-all solution, because it raises questions about privacy, because you don't always want to inform everyone about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, we were working on a project in the area of controlling objects in public spaces where we experimented with short and concise gestures instead of outgoing ones.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be scaled down to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future is mixed control, like gestures and speech.
- What's that?
- For example, would we ask you to hand over this bubble can?
You say it and you point it out.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can do at a given time and what it can't?
Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on developing new types of sensors that allow us to capture people's reactions more precisely.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, because they have a good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- What are your expectations of modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional detection.
Of course, eight megapixels at 1,000 fps wouldn't be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
The resolution along the X and Y axes must be taken into account as well as along the Z axis.
Speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps is too low, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our lab in Redmond with a controllable processing delay between 1 and 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects human-machine interaction.
For my work, I needed a device just like this, only without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the cameras be increased?
- Kinect currently operates with three 'cameras', one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of an object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or amplify the problem, because more calculations would be needed.
So I think it would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play around with different camera properties to see how that helps us in three-dimensional positioning.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft didn't show its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
Don't you think that the glasses have the best prospects for the application of augmented reality technology in everyday life?
Of course, it's not comfortable to always have a smartphone in your hand when you're on the road, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality where we could switch from glasses to smartphones via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and that's their strength (private things only you can see), but also their weakness, because augmented reality with glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in mid-air is not only available to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but to ordinary mortals as well.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point to: There is no tangible response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group intend to give to this objection?
In my lectures, I often talk about augmented reality being the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could very well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of second-hand as a somewhat unusual projection material.
She's a great pressure-sensing woman.
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to make the "images in the air" more tangible, for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a specific point where the finger is, creates a sensation that is currently as faint as if someone were blowing over the palms.
There are also bands for the wrist that interact with the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Make it think it's feeling what it should be feeling when it's seeing something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried it like that.
Herein lies another challenge with which we will have to contend for a long time to come, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed room believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain has been only moderately outsmarted, and we have many years of work ahead of us.
This is what makes virtual reality work so attractive to researchers: we are just getting started on many topics.
It 's your taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg Avant-garde", which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
The selected list already included high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene whose successes go beyond the city's borders and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-bearded man you see at the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the stage meetings, the publications.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a shining figure of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city and by his presence on the street he brings a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens and makes them feel good.
He recently picked up a turntable and became a Petersburg turntable player, feeling finally ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistry, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise when you travel around the city?
I chose red as a color for fashion designers who deal with optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Every provocation I've ever made in the past has been an invitation to a conversation.
When did you know you wanted to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized I had to go that way.
Then the era of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the Gazonevchina; from this came Pushkinskaya 10, and then it was over.
I'm attracted to theater, fashion, music, anything but literature.
And all of that came together in your art clinic... it was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room at 10 Pushkinskaya, and until the renovation work, there was a musical-artistic club for the Bohemians, the House of the St. Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight jerseys and among them was the now-fashioned composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it was the start of his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" and the Griboedov Club also have their origins in the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regulars went.
I'm a hero from the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, the press conducted a poll about the "Personality of our city" award.
I won the category of "Artist of the Year", and that was the high point.
It is not easy to work in new times according to old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has a distinctive style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the timeliness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I'm going to have an exhibition called "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and it scares me to be that way.
In a clown, it blurs all that and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
Let's save the world by making it mandatory for everyone to dress up.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and is oriented to the outer and not the inside of the person.
But maybe you shouldn't shake a man's hand, you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears with the disguise.
We saw you recently playing the urban horn player.
Who else would?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We're seeing the decay of cultures.
In the past, people were in large groups, the Bohemians loved one and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill that everybody likes.
Now you have to figure out who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But Stas Mikhailov's performances are attended by thousands!
- He's got abandoned women coming in, and the sexual-social sphere is a big part of it.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come instead of 10,000, so there's less management, less money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to betray them and not to destroy what I've achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which were even hung in a series with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually don't come until late in my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It's called intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something else entirely.
I'm a man of a past culture, and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and turned down money to paint.
That's the culture I'm all for.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- They're good cultural experts.
They say, "servant of culture".
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real tsars were different, because the tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that real experts were necessary.
There are good advisers in Moscow at the moment.
In St. Petersburg we have some who could be experts, but they are blocked because they need higher-level experts to properly evaluate the first and clear the way for them.
Now it's all about your taste.
The same is true of the Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital; Moscow has much more culture and a corresponding fertile soil.
It's hard for art to grow on our rocks.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because for example we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
We have a lot less of them.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by grants from the City of St. Petersburg
Born in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a hit by a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft carrying Earthlings are searching for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question is, how can we reproduce in zero gravity or on the alternate planet?
I think there are not many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"They are Mars and Venus", says Vladimir Surdin, a scientist at the Sternberg Institute for Astronomy.
However, while conditions on Mars are relatively favorable for life, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees Fahrenheit [500°C].
Life would be possible only at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The researchers first considered the question of reproduction in space in the light of the flora.
Already half a century before that, experiments were being done on plants.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit did not differ in the least from the terrestrial species.
Then came the breeding of insects, specifically tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, watchdog eggs were sent into space to study how weightlessness affects the development of embryos.
It's developing into a normal chick.
But then the trouble begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to stop, stand on its own two feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Medical Biological Problems at the RAN.
Without a firm ground, the chicks would roll wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborns' instincts completely died.
The chicks didn't respond to light or sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we hatched chicks and then stopped because it's impossible to work with them", says Vladimir Sychev about the failed experiment with chicks in space.
The last animal incubator flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will be continued in spring 2013.
However, the Bion biosatellite will only be home to species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was the case with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment and research must continue", says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
The problem of reproduction in outer space has not been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals, humans could in principle do that.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can generate a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing that humanity possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Can she survive space flight?
Will she be able to deliver a baby after this flight?
"In the end, no one answered that question", says space veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just a year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
But there's still a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts who, after long flights, have had a healthy offspring.
"The more the more dangerous it is even in orbit", concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must seek new ways in biotechnology, radiation shielding, and artificial gravity.
The Hydrolab at the Cosmonaut Training Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a suspended state, the cosmonauts gain routine for work in outer space.
The water represents weightlessness.
While adults may find water pleasant, it is a foreign environment; infants, however, perceive water as a natural element.
It's as if the little Ichthyander bear witness to the fact that life on land originated in the ocean.
There is a correlation between the fact that a baby is in amniotic fluid for about nine months in the womb and the fact that it is easier for him to get used to water.
This is logical, since it takes only two weeks from birth to the first swim.
"That's not enough time to forget", says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
So while for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman cannot do without gravity.
In the weightless state, the abdominal and pelvic muscles contract rapidly, and with that, the ability to push the baby out decreases.
All right, let's bypass that with a birth aid.
For example, the birth could be in a special chamber to squeeze the baby out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question posed by Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth's gravity, the body cannot train its skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in a training suit in orbit like an adult.
He will simply be missing the elementary things in his life.
"This experiment we are conducting together, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted human being", predicts Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
So far, the birth of children in space is a theory.
But it will become a reality when the earthlings set off in their spaceships to a distant planet to become the home of their spaceship-born offspring.
NKÚ chief: Control of black system fails because of politics
The Czech Republic has good control bodies and adequate legislation in the field of public procurement but is lagging behind in its application.
This was stated by the Deputy President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I think this is not the case here", Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result seems to be obtained by joint checks by Czech and German auditors.
He cites as a negative practical example the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas towards the so-called 'black system'.
Recently the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its validity, and if something is prohibited by law, then the head of government cannot just come and stop the control office, whose job it is to monitor compliance with the law", notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies you spoke about a joint Czech-German project in which the laws of both countries on public procurement were compared.
What was the point?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
In a nutshell, it is the European legislation that determines how public contracts are to be handled, on which national legislation builds, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this and although the examination is not yet complete, we have been able to find very interesting differences.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly establish new and more detailed rules, but also to look at the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What do you get out of it?
It is precisely this common control which could help us to stop constantly trying to perfect the laws and to lower and balance thresholds when this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Economics means acquiring something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illicit enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering the thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.
It is perhaps even true that we are only burdening the system with excessive paperwork in this way, and those who look for loopholes in the system have a much easier time exploiting the system than if the thresholds were kept higher.
They discuss the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an authority like our NSC or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of the NCA is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college, which is only slightly different in structure.
The powers are similar to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, which means that there are also these courts of account in the individual Länder - this is where the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which is equivalent to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are subject to the control of the Land Revenue.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would like to say that the Commission has not yet decided on the future of the Community's energy policy, but that it is not yet certain whether it will be able to do so.
Is it because the examiners are better?
I'm not sure, but I'm not a big fan of comparisons like that.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a report on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be interested in working with our agency, would you?
As regards the Czech legislation, what was the significance for your authority of the amendment of the procurement law, do you feel any impact?
The amendment is only in force for a short period of time and so far has not had any effect on our tests.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
The impact of the changes is so far felt more in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control tool 'Detection of risks of unfairness' and have used it to examine and analyse almost 14 000 public contracts - where the changes will of course have an impact, as thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tender have been modified, etc.
Do you see the passage of this law as a positive step, or will it burden the system with further bureaucracy?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise when the rules become 'tougher' and cannot be complied with.
Under the previous rules, the persons subject to the audit are already liable to the institution (for example, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) to the extent that any non-compliance with the procurement law amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But is it reasonable to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so, you know.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a formal error that does not affect actual decision-making.
Such a system will only put even greater pressure on the bureaucracy.
Where's the way out?
Let us first say which path is not successful.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother the businessmen with controls of the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now forbidden or permitted?
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
He can say, "We're changing the law and allowing it", but he can't say we're pretending it's not happening.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain operations - and this is also true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic when the bidder with the best offer is excluded solely on the basis of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
The roads are sporadic ice-sloped, but mostly dry.
The Czech roads are partly snow and ice-covered.
However, the roads are mostly well-driveable, and sometimes extra caution is needed.
Other
In the Karlsbad district, the roads were good this morning, with occasional snow and ice.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 degrees Celsius, and it should get a little warmer during the day.
The region is now snow-free, and only a thin snow cover remains in the lower elevations.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountain there is about 30 centimeters of snow.
According to the county highway patrol, visibility was limited due to fog.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid to bridges, for example, where the roadways are sometimes icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, some of these roads are covered with ice or snow.
In particular, at higher levels, increased attention is therefore needed.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové counties
Some roads in East Bohemia are at risk of ice slicks, and the roads at higher elevations and in the mountains may still have a thick layer of snow, the roads and highways authority says on its website.
The road championships warn drivers about ice slicks, which can occur especially at higher elevations in the Pardubice district.
In particular, ice may be smoothed on second and third class roads in the counties of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly heavy on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické hory.
A layer of snow is deposited on the roads of the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov in elevations.
Today, the weather in eastern Bohemia is mostly sunny or clear, and it remains largely free of precipitation.
Temperatures are between minus 3 and + 1°C, and there's a slight wind.
District of Pilsen
The roads in Pilsen district are now well-traveled, but local attention is needed and the driving pattern is to be adapted to the weather.
This one is freezing in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Because of the snow and subsequent drop in temperatures, the roads can get icy.
Local fog is also expected, but visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district road inspectorates.
The D5 motorway is practically free of traffic restrictions, but the road authorities recommend increased attention between kilometres 80 and 131.
The first-class road is mostly dry but frozen.
However, in the south of Pilsen and Tachov districts, ice may gradually slip.
The second and third road classes are wet and therefore the reference to possible icy sections is also applicable.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less busy roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Drivers heading for the high ground in Olomouc district must expect snow today.
After the use of scattered vehicles, Sneematsch remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
The snowfall at night forced the road workshops to work, and according to the data of the road administration, in the Šumperk district about 3 cm of fresh snow fell.
In the rest of the district, the roads are usually fully passable.
"Snow remains in the highlands of Šumperk County.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers heading towards Jeseník have to expect snowfall", an employee of the Šumperk road administration told ČTK today.
Her colleagues in Jeseník County also had to go out at night, and according to her, the roads are clear and wet after chemical treatment up to the heights.
In Olomouc the roads are fully passable, but in Šternberk the drivers must drive with caution in forested sections as the roads are still wet.
The following entries are added in the table:
In northern Bohemia, the road authorities report several badly drivable sections.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí county n.K. is closed, according to the traffic police.
Temperatures remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so snow and ice will remain on the roads.
No traffic disturbances have been reported so far.
Ice slicks are reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal at night - rain and melting snow during the day and clear skies and frost at night.
Traffic conditions are reported on the main roads and on the I/13 road on the border of Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be closed because of branches pushed up onto the road by the snow load.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the world ending in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster stories that we humans like to jump on.
And with our band, The Tap Tap, we're kind of making fun of it, saying that we're the only band in the world that can harness enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also be performing a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide fundraiser we've been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is predicted to end on December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava, starting at 21:00.
The end of the concerts is said to be around the time the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in the time zone.
Who's idea is that?
I thought I was the one who first came up with the idea, and then we worked with our graphic designer Honza Augusta to design it.
We want to not only gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about the state in which we will leave this world to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of anti-doomsday shoes, T-shirts, bags and key chains, which can be purchased from www.e-tap.cz to help us.
The Tap Tap also recorded the so-called anti-doomsday anthem "Doomsday Fails" with other artists.
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it be played at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, assuming everything works out and the end of the world doesn't happen...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all the performers at all three concerts.
The national anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
The lyrics of the anthem are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you come to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is connected with the fact that we realize many charity events and concerts...
We try to involve these people in our projects.
It turns out that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds from the doomsday concerts serve?
For the establishment of the accessible education centre Studeo, which we have been working on for six years with the association Tap at the Jedlička Institute.
Students at the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by tutors who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the editors, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built, into which we will then move with this project.
At each concert, several groups and performers perform.
What criteria did you use to select these?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý are performing.
You can find more information on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, and for this concert we will also prepare an interesting programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play at the Czech House in New York next year, and I personally - if we are in the United States at that time - would also like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans for abroad are not small. You've already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, which means that the wheelchairs have to be carried in the luggage compartment.
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, so that I have sometimes wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Your travels abroad give you a comparison of how accessibility countries are, how disabled people are treated, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its infancy in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is not handicapped-friendly at all.
It is not even self-evident that you let a wheelchair user in the elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also associations that try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's still a lot of things we're stuck with...
It should be noted, however, that improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public spaces, to go to museums, to use toilets, etc.
It is not very common for a large group of disabled people to be actively involved in social activities, and we are a little ahead of the West in this respect with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect in the public and accessibility is one thing, but only when great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
I started as a tutor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intense.
And since I'm a musician myself and play saxophone, I founded a music company with a colleague.
Well, as our host, Láďa Angelovič, says, with time, things get out of hand.
But the band only became known in recent years, am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; besides, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We've come to realize that if you're doing something and you can't see it on the outside, then in a sense, your performance doesn't exist.
The EU funding also enables us to afford good editors, high-quality equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business, people often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since anything new is considered with caution and accepted only after a long time.
There are few things that are truly unique, and I dare say that tap tap is one of them.
The first impression the spectator usually has is of course pity; that's only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings to be pitied.
They are people who can live a full life and develop if they have the necessary means.
I always say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it's not just progress for themselves, it's progress for the whole society.
Was it also helpful to this success that you are a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise in many things and you must also demand a certain amount of discipline.
I think this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they realize that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to go through the preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, then the enthusiasm for many quickly fades.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that's serious about working and trying to get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of these were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
There's only one, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't stop them.
Anyone who wants to be a part of this is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected by live link at the end and a joint interpretation of the anthem "End of the World Comes" by the band The Tap Tap will be played.
The concert aims to raise funds for the equipping of a multifunctional education centre for the disabled to be built at the Jedlička Institute in Prague under the name STUDEO.
Admission is 400 CZK, children under 12 free, tickets are available in advance at Bohemian Ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency (ESA) at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries, making it the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which joined ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish space enthusiasts were engaged in space exploration, but they did not always find understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch for "Introduction to Cosmonautics", which was donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis' world-renowned contribution to space exploration was recognized in part by the naming of one of the craters on the far side of the moon after him.
As early as 1925, a railway drainage system was built in Poland, with a rocket engine planned for it.
The author of the draft and the details of this project remained unfortunately unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to slow down the Draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to study rocket-propelled grenades.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents provided show that the research had progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was interrupted by the German invasion.
In 1937, the design of a photoelectric fighter rocket by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the professional press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects concerned the military use of the rocket propulsion system.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of activity, its work was terminated by the outbreak of war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is in the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, which contains four extensive articles on space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to establish a space society.
At that time, the first satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space exploration would have a future.
The Polish Space Society (PTA) was already seeking to join the International Space Federation (ISF) when it was founded in 1951.
The following year, the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice-Chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been a major player in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, with a maximum altitude of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the Błędów Desert with the RM-2 two-stage rocket.
The missile was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high winds.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the space for carrying scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a carrying capacity of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude of all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Institute of Aviation, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a takeoff weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built afterwards.
It is also worth noting that Poland joined the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
Repealing the law on public works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the law on public works.
This decision provoked a lively public discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
The result is that the individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free and unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
The large differences in the value of labour (wages) lead to price tensions.
The term 'sub-contracting' refers to a situation in which a manufacturer tries to compete economically by importing a good at a low price, thus 'undercutting' the competition in order to gain a larger share of the market and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means that most companies either move production abroad or buy cheaply there, or go out of business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparable labour costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This is a well-known situation, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thereby attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own people over to private capital without regard for the social consequences.
This is particularly evident in changes to existing legislation.
The aim of these measures is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done on the one hand by economic coercion in the case of longterm unemployment and on the other by the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food delivery centres for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves by their own labour for some years.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the state has to raise their income to the subsistence level.
A similar scandal was also uncovered in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of virtually all EU southern countries will undoubtedly result in the same situation, where people are forced to emigrate (as in the 19th century) under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of their social status, or to live on the margins of society for a living wage, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
The question naturally arises here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, it merely moves poverty from one country to another; or the capital is left out altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or Africa in general, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This is a problem for all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim to the extreme that the state cannot participate in its own economy with capital, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is narrowly insisting that the state must not intervene in the economy.
But then one has to ask whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the straightforward answer: yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a virtually all-powerful lobby which is present everywhere in all countries.
The result is a desperate situation of corruption, of mutual advantage, of legislation where virtually everything is criminal but nothing is.
In Germany, the situation is such that a State Ministry, for lack of funds, entrusts draft legislation to private legal firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
All violence will then no longer come from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from powerful financial groups that put their own interests first.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation described by Appian in his Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long since fallen into decay, and the offices have been taken by force.
By bribery, by illegal advantage or by stone and sword.
Corruption grew unchecked, and the people went to the polls with votes already bought"... "People with character did not run for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline"... "People began to really talk about the only medicine in this difficult situation being monarchy, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian was thinking of Pompey, but the strong man was eventually Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with monarchy.
As it turns out, modern society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference for self-interest, without regard for the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognising and implementing the benefit to society as a whole.
The result, then and now, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who make no effort at all to bring about more profound reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be found in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
What is particularly disastrous is the fact that today's elites are completely ignorant of the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abolition of the law on public works is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
The Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways of reducing the social level of its population under the pressure of global and European economic competition.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel is a laboratory of chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or could ever come from violence", Sting sings in Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is, "...so we don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want war, there would be none", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and Gaza has, as always, generated a myriad of reactions.
The one side is behind Israel and argues for its right to self-defence, while the other side calls the Palestinians terrorists; the other side supports the Palestinians, argues for the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs and calls the State of Israel a terrorist.
I do not wish to write here about who is guilty and who is the victim of these recurring waves of killing; in the end, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence itself.
I am trying to give readers a glimpse behind the scenes, a glimpse into who the 95 years of tension (beginning with the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in this small country in the Middle East are serving above all.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and stem from my own understanding of who or which group of people significantly influences the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of power struggles.
In any era, we can identify Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether it was really always these personalities themselves who determined their steps autonomously, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power did not occur within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out in particular, one who might be described as the head of the Kraken (I do not know if anyone is above them, but I do not rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about her.
I can understand that.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds back in the 1890s to prevent their name from being associated with highly criminal activities, always with the goal of consolidating their power, increasing their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds have a stake in almost all the central banks of the world, and they are waging wars or arming themselves against countries where they do not have a stake in central banks (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq, there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi, there were only four countries left, with Russia in the meantime having subordinated its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family paid with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as the central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. government) notes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for causing the Great Depression in 1929.
The Rothschilds' global power-hunger led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge, in 1859-71.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchical states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Great Britain, and the third war was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their comforts and luxuries and would not consume so many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is only the prelude here) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families, with the Rothschilds at the top, work is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see creation of the FED to prevent crises like the one they triggered in 1907).
After they succeeded in starting World War I by assassinating the Habsburg heir to the throne, Ferdinand, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Empire by the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, unfounded military and economic surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power Austria-Hungary.
To make it easier to ignite World War II, the bankers created a latent conflict situation through politics by paying Germany huge war reparations, thereby creating the condition for impoverished masses, so that they had only to cheer for the Germans a sufficiently strong leader who named the culprits and offered simple solutions. Another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the role of a fifth column and also took on the role of igniting the war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought the establishment of a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, mentioned earlier, set the stage for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and there were initial clashes with the Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain that had initially held him back by the international bankers or whether everything went according to plan is hard to say. In any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the reparations for war against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the casualties on the front lines, as in the Second World War, this time alongside the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country itself but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, where the beginning was the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
We must distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because the international bankers in Israel, as well as in our country, the people, elect only their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, the Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-prone politician loyal to international bankers who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and in which Iran's control of the two-mile-wide Strait of Hormuz, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies flow, could lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light do David Rockefeller's words of 1994 appear: "All we need is a global crisis, and people will welcome the new world order".
In their minds, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to subject this being to total control.
He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and its number is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: When the worst comes to the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamic students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
In exchange for their release, they demanded the extradition of deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who had fled the revolution to the United States, which had maintained patronage over his regime for decades.
The American government had no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have seriously damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent hostage rescue attempt only made matters worse.
The captive diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debacle in Iran was a major factor in Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Just before the embassy was taken over, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, managed to get the refugees out of Iran, helping them with an extravagant story to conceal their true identity - they were traveling on Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who were supposedly visiting the country for a science fiction film shoot.
Combination of genres
The plan, developed by exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, also required the cooperation of Hollywood.
To make the cover story credible, articles about this film project were published in trade magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of this operation were kept secret for a long time, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time it is also a so-called "caper movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar play such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the filming of the same situations).
On the other hand, there are the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly over-the-top.
And then there's the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions-- men in suits at the conference table, in the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable career comeback with this film.
A derided actor has become a respected director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime drama Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that set the director's previous films apart from the standard Hollywood.
Affleck, however, also demonstrates this sentiment in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are set in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really happened - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the fake film stick on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually have many cinematically exciting scenes.
He works with the little one, but he is quite successful, sometimes adding to the reality - which is not always so elegant (the scenes of the impending crisis at Tehran airport being deflected by a phone call in America, or the chase on the runway, seem a bit artificial).
Argo's weakness is its overly wide dispersion, caused by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
It's a movie that you can watch with some interest, and you can enjoy the design and retro style that's reminiscent of a 1970s thriller.
But it is difficult to get enthusiasm.
But it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive and proving how overblown the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing intelligence services are.
Guidelines for the inflation of balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey on the most absurd bank charges, decided to hold the "Most Absurd Regulation or Idea from the EU Workshop" competition this year.
"We came up with this idea with the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% female management ratio in large European companies", said Patrik Nacher, who organises the survey, to the Právo newspaper.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect, and I am sure that the Commission will be able to do so.
Until then, women had an advantage in life insurance because they represented objectively less risk to insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
The EU's controversial regulations include the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is harmful to the environment, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers, simply because they contain a relatively small amount of this dangerous substance, and the chicken cage size directive, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
The actual ban on the use of the term 'buttercoating' or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs have also been criticised in the past.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that trade and industry lobby, whose demands are usually represented in Brussels by one or more Member States (the Czech Republic, for example, is currently trying to veto the demands of Czech banks).
Lobbying interests also pushed for bananas of the highest commercial grade in the EU to be at least 14 cm long and not have a 'curvature anomaly'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonizing the disparate national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruit and vegetables, despite opposition from some countries, saying that the previous directives would lead to food waste.
One possible candidate for victory in this survey is last year's EU regulation, which requires balloons to be sold with a warning that children under eight cannot inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU cited an American study which found that balloons are the leading cause of child death by suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using market straws.
Weird ideas at home
A directive that applies to European officials themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone who holds an official position in the EU is not allowed to use the name Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece and must say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) instead.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated the EU regulation on the size of food stocks in the territory of a member state, in addition to the so-called absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum amount of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession.
The Czech Republic, for example, exceeded the volume of preserved mushrooms, for which we were subject to a heavy fine.
The survey organisers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should be paid for not having a sea or by the idea of giving grants for grant applications.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, of course, but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement", said Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), then Minister of Agriculture.
It argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state stores were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
The Czech Republic has another way to ports, so the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally went so far as to invite the Czech Republic to tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered grants for grant applications to municipalities, specifically to be used for grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
While regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts say that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to make the European Union more effective and evolving deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is EU funding for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration but have been forced on the budget negotiations of individual Member States.
The Czech Republic is also feeling the emotion of having to fight in Brussels, like other Member States, for the right to use specific names for traditional products, and not always winning.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky" after a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the domestic rum (Tuzemský rum), whose tradition goes back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The name 'rum' may only be used for products of sugar cane distillate, not for products of sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes the world-famous Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lubeck marzipan and Parma ham, Karlsbad zwieback, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, and Saazer hops.
The EU trade mark is used to promote Pardubice gingerbread or Hořic rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur", Okamura claims.
Senator, how did you get the idea to run for president?
I'm not here to be a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I wouldn't run for office.
But I can no longer stand by and watch the Republic being looted for 20 years, while thieves walk free while people's taxes and retirement age are raised.
I had no ambitions to become a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change it.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and nonpartisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for the office of senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you made your way to the castle.
Doesn't that turn your back on your constituents?
I told myself all along that I would fight for the castle after the Senate election.
Later I clarified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function, the function is a tool to make my vision a reality.
I need as much influence and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty is not only that we as a people curse in the pubs and on television, but that we belittle anyone who wants to make a difference.
And then there are the media, which try to rob you of your honor, and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was accused of bribing journalists or of being an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You have begun the fight for the castle with the thesis of the material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive declarations of assets of over 20 million crowns.
You'll have to change the laws to do that.
As president, you have no authority in this matter, and only the Senate as a whole can introduce legislation.
How do you propose to solve this problem?
As a citizen, I advocated that the tour guide remain a free trade, and this was enforced.
The problem is the small-minded politics - if someone from the right or the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party member, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take away from any party what is best for our country without box-thinking and party dogmas.
Do you see yourself as a person on the left or the right in politics?
From a Czech point of view, I think people see me more on the left.
I am not interested in this right-left thinking.
It's important to me that we move on.
I don't care if someone is on the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you make a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's the one you want to approach.
I think you can call this populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world or have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in Parliament, you'll be left with nothing but slogans.
And that's not going to get you very far in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce, for example, the material and criminal liability?
I don't have any other choice.
We have to convince politicians, journalists and the public to try and get them on our side to push through these goals.
As President, I would have no problem in calling on the leaders of the parliamentary parties to introduce legislation on the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
The respondents would then have to explain why they do not want to do so.
A strong personality who points out grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for instance the direct election of the president, which was a result of public pressure.
I say very clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started in politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to evaluate things myself, and if it doesn't work out, then in six years I'm going back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's job is to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I can't do anything alone, so I've talked to several prominent people about whether they want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken to Radim Jančura, for example, but he has refused because of the workload.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade of light fuel oil.
I started my candidacy assuming that people were deeply unhappy, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of those eligible to vote have not gone to the polls at all, and those who have gone have mostly voted for establishment representatives.
That leaves us two independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen a Senate composition that will make changes very difficult to enforce.
I will fight for my vision, however, for the direct election of mayors and district leaders.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign; my transparent account has only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have any money?
You talk about a statement of assets, what would yours look like?
I estimate my personal fortune at about 60 million CZK.
I have a property in Prague worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth about a million.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream, by the way. I always liked James Bond, the way he drove the car, was gallant with women, and at the same time fought against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune of $60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
What, do you want me to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program doesn't seem to be attracting much interest.
And I'm not obligated to campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on a senator's salary alone, so I could not, for example, finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I was just trying to make money, I wouldn't be running for anything.
So you're going to continue to work as an entrepreneur to make a living?
Didn't you say you were going to roll back these activities?
But it's not about the salary.
As promised, I've partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the travel agency's managing director in the spring.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to make a living.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
Some 200,000 to 400,000, and it's still going on.
But as President, I would cease my undertakings altogether.

MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the head - on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and it's finally something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company nearby, says, "Yes, it's nice, the house".
But I wonder why we need a library today.
Everyone has Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to one of those old-fashioned libraries anymore, do they?
Spijkenisse, a sleepy town on the outskirts of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The municipality of 80,000 inhabitants has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counteract this stupidity, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to public education by recreating the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes as beautifully painted steel-concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of daring bar diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual serenity and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around in perplexity and shrugging, the naughty Maas piled his fine, great-sized gift up to a pyramid and ended his action-packed speech with the words: "Dear City Council!"
So that's it, my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is being filled in.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes a underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent residential and row houses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This makes the faceless small-town town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an astonishingly ugly city hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory, richer for a piece of contemporary architecture.
But most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: the book eldorado under the cheese bell.
Although there is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain range, the true joys of space and reading are unlocked by the pedestrian climb of the topography.
The interior, which is glazed all around, is bright and clear, the burnt-out clinker floors and the elegant street lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public city square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
They're already looking for park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And books everywhere, books, books.
"Usually the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We've turned the classic room configuration upside down and molded the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the bookshelf is used skillfully: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and home technology center.
A special pleasure is the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes sillings, sometimes staircases.
The look, the feel and the smell are foreign.
Even experienced architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Municipality of Spijkenisse, when asked by the Standard.
And so one day we came across a suitable agricultural waste product on a farm in Friesland.
For many years, a millimeter-thin plastic film has been used in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands as a root support.
It's cheap and time-saving.
The thin fabric lasts for a season or two, then it's ready for the lockdown.
For the library, the fibers were pressed into four-centimeter-thick plates - the first ever in such quantities.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (APP) turns a dark, homogeneous, load-bearing material that smells like a new car and sports shoes.
105 steps to the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter trek, the literature café offers not only a fantastic view of the city but also Dutch croquettes and ficus trees.
They provide atmosphere, but most importantly, they provide the right humidity in the literature mountain.
Donating for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but despite the glass, this house is an ecological model", says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled by geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass collapse, the sun shines only briefly inside even on sunny days.
The wide wooden glue bars that line the glass facade provide shade and absorb much of the sun's radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest will be done by fully automatic rollers.
Stefan Spermon, the initial IT skeptic, had already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
And so is TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg the "long overdue soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
The aim is to fill the gaps in the library, which is still not fully stocked - currently 70,000 items.
The concept has taken off.
The shelves are full to the brim.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for decoration.
The new system of social security is a new one.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
Young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the inclusion of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin balances this on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the Palestinians' request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin refrained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without, however, being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy from one that was managed by the United States, so to speak, to one that is German.
The European Union is not a coherent and unified policy.
So the Germans are meeting between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still learning their role, but they are on the way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What does a 'normal' foreign policy mean in concrete terms from the German point of view?
It shows a willingness to take positions which are independent of those of the USA or European partners when it comes to national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude to the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf States.
So we have to be careful not to embarrass the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
It certainly does.
But I wouldn't want to give it too much weight either, because it's not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the United States by abstaining from important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the United States of America for the German position.
I therefore do not think that this was a break as dramatic as the one in Libya.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect for itself.
It is a sign that it is being taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has been clear in its support for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration has a pretty good understanding of the European position.
But given the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not that enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would of course be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things from their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in pushing Europe to a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans realize that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany want to take on a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still struggling to take the lead?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for the country to play a greater role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, every time Germany takes on a greater role, various anti-German sentiments are released.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
That's the old problem, you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to be open to all kinds of neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
The US influence in European politics is continually declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it's unpleasant and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese"
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a name which is officially registered in China but which is not related to the companies of origin.
Yet it is protected as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they'll be right.
"It's becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, who specializes in infringements in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
The imitators need only a few letters to register their trademarks.
So Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you have Prada-Kny.
German companies are also being legally copied in this way, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with records from the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, a registered trademark also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloch's case is different: on behalf of his clients, he is opposed to Chinese companies being officially granted by the Trademark Office the right to use a name already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger badge.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
That's women chasing rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty
"This is bad for business, we have to fight it", says Pattloch.
"The brand is diluted, the uniqueness is lost, the image damage is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs for the industries concerned are in the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the removal of dubious trademark entries is difficult and costly.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports cases in which the Court rejected claims because the name in question had become a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for infringing his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore who turned their eyes away from the famous crocodile.
The Chinese authorities are not guilty.
The CTMO in Beijing admits that there were shortages in 2010 due to insufficient staff and space.
The Commission has also been asked to provide a detailed description of the measures taken to combat the problem.
The number of unresolved objections fell by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, a 75 percent increase over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 appeals are still pending in the Office.
The cost of addressing this is high
As so often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trade mark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new cases worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the agency said.
The same applies to the stock of all valid trade marks, totalling 5.5 million.
In 2011, fees amounted to 1,8 billion yuan.
Simply put, this means that each registration costs on average 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
The cost of addressing this is manifold, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The German authorities were able to get the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts out of the way.
However, the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
They themselves failed to do so because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, the chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also rejected the Munich objection.
In the next two cases Freudenberg was right, but the opponent continues to fight to this day.
You gotta be careful as hell .
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will be brought to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely time-consuming, costly, and nerve-wracking".
The internal costs were hard to quantify, and the company's archives even had to go through a hundred-year-old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the other party a "high six-figure euro amount" to settle the case, but it was in vain.
"That shows how much it's worth to us", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten to spill back into Europe.
That is, when counterfeiters secure unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for footwear and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business area, but it was able to avoid registration.
"You have to be hell-bent", says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
Relying on international trademark rights is not enough, but foreigners should "register anything worth protecting in China", Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it could be a lot more expensive than registering.
In fact, if Freudenberg was to be subjected to the last act of his brand drama, then one would probably have to pay the other party royalties for one's own name, Wentzler explains.

World AIDS Day: Stamp, sing and help
In Heidelberg, the choir rehearses Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans well over 8,733 kilometers.
First, there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers, looking for the beat on the floor, finding it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Then the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor, and soprano - slowly swell, pestering, seducing, and chasing each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it off his shoes as he combines them with his smooth, wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
The 50 singers have come, aged between 23 and 69, from the human geneticist to the housekeeper.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each chorus voice has a different text and this one in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
Worldwide, there are some 34 million people living with HIV, according to UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, 245,000 AIDS orphans are living.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them are in secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take on a sponsor.
She guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praise in Zulu.
No one in this room can speak the Bantu language fluently but sing.
For nearly a decade, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign, soft language, occasionally taking them back to their original home in southern Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres (8,733 mi) from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voting power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some in simple mud and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 of them have lost their parents because they succumbed to the HIV virus.
Esitjeni is a small example of what suffers Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to halve the risk of infection, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than 40 percent of Swazilanders carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their mid-30s is not uncommon.
On a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but most of all, the Imbongi saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a college degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was a private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to provide him with a hot meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which has since been providing almost professional care for the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STI' s include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Flea and scabies are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and tripping are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), tripper and human papillomavires are common sexually transmitted diseases.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low, yet they account for about 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In addition, the country has a high incidence of human papillomaviruses in adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of an STD?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary problems, discharge, lower abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100 percent protection.
Because some sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular check-ups, especially for those who frequently change sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and prevent their later effects.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the salaries that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around EUR 200 000 to Esitjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the chair of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well housed, perhaps with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, providing them with a roof over their heads and ensuring that the children wear their uniforms and arrive at school on time every day.
If you are without anyone, you can come to the shelter to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association the same as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
Voices for Africa also started a sewing school, built two chicken coop and, in partnership with the American health organization PSI, organized a HIV test for many people in the village.
This is not a matter of course, because no matter how obvious the disease is throughout the country, it is preferred to remain silent.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Actually, it's strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This government-sanctioned way of life is also one of the reasons why the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available everywhere, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are hardly used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh".
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together through southern Africa every two or three years, singing songs of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many at the southern tip of the black continent still know from apartheid times.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also caused some grim border guards to shed a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although the small village is hardly found on maps, it is well-known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is light", the people there say.
And if you go back to the 8733 kilometers of airline to Heidelberg, to the thumping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you see it shining there too.
NASA has discovered ice on Mercury .
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is said to be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has detected the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also contains frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
The wall should be at least 12 inches [30 cm] thick and possibly up to 70 feet [20 m] thick.
The water probably came from comets or possibly asteroids that hit Mercury.
But no one is linking the ice find to the existence of life on the planet, said Messenger's chief scientist, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images back to Earth, little starholes into infinite space.
The image is from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition of the term in 2006.
This image from the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars are blue dots, while the pink "newborns" in the galaxy are harder to identify.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer Telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is made of material ejected by the star as it died.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are being formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic birthing room.
The Pleiades, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
The telescope, however, gives the colors a better impression.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks toward the viewer in this infrared photo.

One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope, the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color scheme, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image released by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, three-split), as dark dust stripes cut the glowing heart of the star's birthplace into three.
In the constellation Serpent Bearer, astronomers have photographed the precursors of a cosmic carambolation: 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are racing toward each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't know technical abbreviations, you might call them Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope image shows a section of the iris nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The 1,400-light-year-distant nebula is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle always produces new youngsters.
This star cloud, too, combined with the Rosetta Nebula, is continually producing new baby stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly shining galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was dominated by hydrogen.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - before Galileo Galilei used it to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown larger and larger - and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary island of La Palma is huge - the mirror alone measures some 40 feet [10.4 m] in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the convenient design is that the telescope is fixed at its height and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at an altitude angle.
Its peculiarity is its high light-gathering power.
This is because, despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it is comparable to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening in to space for signals from outer space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 300 meters.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory for the Astronomy of the Sea (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, which lives up to its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is to be a whopping 42 meters long - and made up of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
The pictures are expected in 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each averaging 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is also looking at the sky with the Subaru Telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - a mirror with a diameter of 100 feet [30 m].
Here's an illustration to marvel at.
The most important images from space, however, come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The image shows the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched in 2018 at the earliest on board an Ariane 5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data because the messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
The Messenger probe, launched in 2004 and the first to orbit Mercury, has given scientists certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and you'll live to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical high age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblical high age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The ride through the Talish mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbled along the winding road, past dense forested hills, raging rivers, and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and lush, you'd think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Caucasian ethnic group of the Talys live here, about whom little is known except that they speak perfect Persian as well as Assyrian and are very long-lived.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts of oversized Soviet-era architecture that does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the drive from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too cumbersome.
It takes eight hours to cover the 200 miles because the road is single-lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to attract tourists.
"Baku became famous with the Eurovision Song Contest in May - and next year we have a festival of the world's oldest people here", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the life history of about eight dozen Talys from the area, the older than 100, Fatulayeva pointing to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he lived to be 120.
At 136 years of age, she has a child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
But there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person to live to 122 years of age, Mussumov's age seems highly questionable.
"He was born here in the region in 1805, and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to another daughter.
So, did Şirali Müslümov, at his age, make a few decades of profit?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher on ageing at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also remarkable numbers of elderly people in some areas of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and even in Sardinia there are extremely large numbers of very old men".
However, due to the lack of documentation, no scientific evidence of age could be provided, especially since there were no social security registers.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerik are remarkably common in reaching a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years old.
So why are there so many elderly people living here in the South?
The Assyrian guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by the special genes of the Talys.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it's the diet.
But the fact that the very high-calorie diet of the Talyschians, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy does not seem to be particularly plausible from a nutritional point of view.
In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a butter barrel that she's tirelessly rolling back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around, too.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests and served in the typical, stomach-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it never went out and kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought groceries in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was in the period after the Second World War.
But things got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
Propaganda sounds strange coming from an old woman.
But the cult of the father figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
At least there is no need among Azerbaijan's elders.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's now-graying son is right: "The elderly are highly respected in our culture".
They live in the midst of the extended family, are loved, cared for, and are happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human rights" is missing from the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep divisions in the country.
The future constitution with Sharia law as its basis is hotly debated.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the people as a whole, but especially to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the seculars.
Because all of them, hopelessly battling in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a god-state on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He said, almost apologetically, that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the University of Southern California, is really trying to save is not clear to the Egyptians, but to the world.
Is the judiciary to be dismissed?
Indeed, the 234 articles that were whipped through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member constituent assembly in a night-long 15-hour parlor battle are partly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what is "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and there is reason to fear that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal space that comes with it to interpret the Sharia more strictly.
This is suggested by at least one newly added article: in all matters concerning Sharia law, consultation must be with Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution with a strong presence in all of Sunni Islam.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto result in the emptying of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
These courts were used to suppress opposition during Mubarak's rule.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
The draft also says the state should "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is so vaguely worded in legal terms that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of film and literature.
In plain language, that means nothing but censorship.
The Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
Another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording of the prohibition on "insulting people" is also dubious.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar enough?
The report, which is being prepared by the Commission, is a good example of the way in which the European Union can help to ensure that the European Union is able to take on board the challenges of the present crisis.
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the overwhelming power of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unusual unity on Friday evening in Tahrir Square in Cairo, vowing to overturn the charter before it could take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place finisher in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution belongs "on the dustbin of history".
He accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to stage a "coup against democracy" via a short message service on Twitter.
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned for", opposition politician Khaled Ali was quoted by Egyptian media as saying.
And several judges announced they would not oversee the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, counter-demonstrated, but not in Tahrir Square as a precaution, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile River in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and Salafists joined in, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded of Morsi, "Purify the country!" and insisted, "The Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have likely provoked civil war-like conditions.
Morsi's supporters obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which way the country should go.
A majority for the Islamist draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because he believed human rights were indivisible.
For that, he was beaten, convicted, imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution", he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three branches of government has caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto abolishing it", Saeda laments.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone, even from the international community, which looks at the ideological battle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could be payback.
A protester on Tahrir warns: "You are carrying a monster that you can no longer control".
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most foul-smelling fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe but in the world.
Could the country's secret success have something to do with the local appetite for rather foul-smelling fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You put them in the middle of a bunch of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave it there for a week.
This is how you can imagine the nasal-stunning smell of rackfish, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, spectacular scenery, and this persistent smell in the air that just won't go away.
Rakfish is salt-sprayed trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how badly you want it to smell.
When it gets dark in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a party here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then you rinse it down with a glass of Aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who works at the local fire department but also hosts the festival as the so-called "Rakfisk General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and drink large amounts of alcohol.
"People like the aquavit better than the rackfish", says Havard.
The liquor can block out the smell.
I'll have some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the shrimp near your nose, it is not bad - like sushi after a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish were soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the depths of winter, it was then taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - no doubt with the help of alcohol-stimulated senses.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13 percent are immigrants, attracted by a thriving job market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which not so long ago was far richer than Norway, immigrants are pouring in.
Rakfisk is considered important - an essential, though strong-smelling, part of Norwegian history.
It's one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a whopping 10 euros.
Norway doesn't often make it to the world press, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here, people still hate to call Anders Breivik by name - that racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "incident of July 22".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Norway's wealth today is largely due to the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, who handes out round tablets of ripe shrimp and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Her English is just as perfect as most people's here.
We're not very boastful, we don't like bragging.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's revenues is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone was throwing around money they didn't even own, Norway kept its wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And of course, eating shellfish", she adds with a light-hearted laugh.
I'm standing in the snow, waiting for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
I'm not sure I like a moose burger like that.
But in the evening, the stinking fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of several venues that host a rackfish dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish to smell.
There's a live TV feed of a fly-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of shrimp.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Harvard".
You clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overcome by the aquavit.
But maybe it's the harsh fog of all the fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is off to a rocky start
As Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, BBC's Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, it is a city always congested, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected, blocking several major traffic routes into the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential oath and assume leadership of the nation.
He is facing a complex task.
Mexico has been doing well economically under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is gripped by a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My administration is strongly committed to reducing violence", Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to help us achieve this goal.
Before he was on par with the U.S. president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A straight man
For example, in the remote town of Valle del Bravo, he is fondly remembered.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, one can take one of the highways that Pena Nieto built, a major improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed.
His name is also displayed outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting change from him", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a congressman for Pena Nietos' PRI party.
We hope that, in particular, in terms of security and the economy, we will see an interesting and real change, which our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pena Nieto.
The opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance are rejected.
He was a very direct man, very committed and had big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is a good listener.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under highway crossings, the town is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to combat the neighborhood's drug gangs, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In a patch of barren land near a large landfill, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left in the last two years alone.
During the term of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that even surpasses that of Ciudad Juarez, a city notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Pena Nieto's critics believe that he has not addressed the problem of female homicide adequately during his tenure.
But at worst, his government has turned a blind eye to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the slum, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed", recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigidity had already set in.
While her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall, next to a cross that bears a single word: justice.
But that's what the family says she's been denied until now.
The authorities treated me like I was a gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want you to just accept their verdict and shut up.
"But that's not possible with so many misspellings and omissions", she says.
President Pena Nieto is taking on a great responsibility when he receives the presidential ribbon on Saturday.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime in the last six years, and the new president has promised to take special care of this problem during his term in office.
"I hope that as president he will be like he was as governor", says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors claim Bradley Manning never complained of abuse.
Prosecutors dispute Bradley Manning's claims that he was abused in prison.
The hearing will focus on Manning's time in the military prison at Quantico, Virginia.
The defense seeks a dismissal of the charges based on the harsh conditions of detention.
A U.S. Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Prosecutors tried Friday to establish that Army veteran Bradley Manning - accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history - failed to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military custody on several occasions.
In a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing at Fort Meade, Maryland, Major Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month detention at Quantico, Virginia, did not contain any complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request by the defense to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison term - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after meeting with Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he served time in enhanced conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When asked by Fein on Friday about the forms, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as a whole to be "very professional".
The forms, according to Fein, contained no complaints of abuse, even though the officers had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that officials had discussed them with him and said they would address them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) 'no problems', and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all", Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to "prevention of injury".
The military said it assigned him this restrictive status - one level below the suicide risk - for his own protection and that of others.
"I wanted to convince staff that I was doing well and get rid of the injury prevention surveillance status (...) so that I could achieve what I think is a better quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he considered suicide and once fainted from the heat.
Not knowing what was happening to him or to the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours -- with no company.
All he was allowed was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving because during the day, he was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He was always forced to sleep with light coming from outside his cell.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally filed a complaint against Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned him about a charge he had made in his testimony on Thursday, which involved sleeping naked in his cell at Quantico one night and standing naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he never had the opportunity to wrap himself in his blanket during that count.
During Friday's interrogation, Manning said he had been told by a guard to drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before, and that he had previously tried to show an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the strap of his underwear or his flip-flops to injure himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his prison experience and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser charges while other charges deemed too extreme will be challenged.
The prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning was held in accordance with the regulations that apply to all detainees held under the highest security measures at Quantico.
Manning's charges include aiding the enemy, illegally posting classified information on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to blame immigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at passport control when I was startled.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and another for "Extranjeros" ("foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to.
I grew up in central California and have been called a Mexican all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation -- just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
Later, I decided to go with Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for shortcuts or binding.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and stood in line for the extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the issues that you would expect when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico as to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modeled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war against the drug cartels, though he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848 and forced the country's leadership at gunpoint to give up more than half of its territory.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, memories of this event are not to be missed.
So whenever a U.S. government official makes even the slightest criticism of Mexico, complaints are heard - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how Americans are threatening the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are going to war.
And yet Mexico's greatest challenge is actually its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree, someone -- maybe a parent or grandparent -- was not offered a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person matched a profile -- dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of those people, and our allegiance is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may be living the American dream now, going to good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living, not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but our loyalty is not.
This is clearly the case for the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the silk curtain, living a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there are tensions between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are -- and Mexican Americans resent that.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they don't belong to either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I learned during my trip, there's something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educated middle class want to reestablish their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States.
We're supposed to tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Well, you know.
That's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And with the unequal distribution of income, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for its treatment of Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans harbor resentment for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope.
Amid the usual blame-sharing, countless buildings were destroyed, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza hit near the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of that chaos.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there is reason to believe that the deadly impasse may finally be over.
A War Neither Lost nor Won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the hardliners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have pushed the Israelis back, even though their group itself has suffered heavy casualties.
Despite the deaths of several Hamas leaders and the confinement of the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to draw powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a re-emerging regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas - as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah is in power, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels may face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and most important Arab country - on the southern flank of Israel has permanently changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secularist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is allied with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas could prove to be an actor that even Israel and the United States cannot push out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, Iron Dome, has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep better.
The United States is firmly on its diplomatic position and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation in violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, not least thanks to the barricades that run into the West Bank and the main part of a possible Palestinian state, which protect the Jewish settlements, which have been declared illegal under international law but are continuing to expand.
Netanyahu is in a good place, his Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 elections under Avigdor Lieberman.
Why should we also treat these treacherous Palestinians with kindness and give them their own state?
If they were in control of the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets just like their comrades in Gaza?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
The hardliners may be able to prevail, but the Arab Spring could wipe them out.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties at home.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors put together.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments in rebuilding their economies.
The fact that pragmatic President Morsi is teaming up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should also think long-term.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking timid steps towards democratization, Palestinians continue to be denied their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will no doubt one day explode in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and as the Arab population grows, this situation will only get worse.
Bloody missions to repel Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an outside push.
The correct answer is the one advocated by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states, from which Israel cedes territory for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence to enforce this solution.
Egypt must now join Turkey and Qatar in halting arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is in a better position than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by a land swap and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab nations outside should also try to get Hamas and Fatah to agree.
This would be more in favour of the creation of a Palestinian state than the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama too must do his part in moving Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far from the White House, it seems he's equally reluctant to get involved.
But that is a sad, short-sighted prospect.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packages identical for all tobacco brands
The world's first uniform cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have been introduced in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive green covers, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and babies and children affected by cigarette smoke.
Aside from the different health warnings and pictures, starting next Saturday, the only difference between the packages is in the brand names, which are printed in identical small print.
This introduces Australia's most stringent regulations on tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government is based on studies that show that people who have not started smoking at age 26 are 99 percent likely not to start again.
"You can see from a young age that children understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand", says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have little effect on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
The legislation was said to promote black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will have serious, unintended consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be selling far more of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has skyrocketed since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws in the High Court of Australia two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
Experts say the catch in the popularity of social media is precisely the population group the plan targets.
A series of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from acting as sports sponsors, and forced most retailers to stop putting cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"Anyone who markets tobacco and has only a small area to advertise their products doesn't get around the Internet", says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in brand testimonials written by "very normal people".
The question is: Is this just a private individual who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even records a video for them - or is there a marketing agency involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws instead of marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - countries that complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions even though none of them trade more with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has been in talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to mandate photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cigarette and put the box away", says Victor El Hage about buying a pack of cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco shop in Sydney's inner city, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shelves.
"I used to take an hour to sort a shipment, now I need four", says Yu.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes altogether - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing", he adds visibly angry.
In a world that is always electrified, it's nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had plenty of time to think about some boredom.
I don't want to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty tiring - even when books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are pointing to boredom as a positive.
If they're right, it's okay for us - and our kids - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may promote creativity.
And because most of us are staring at one screen or another almost all the time, we no longer enjoy the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- I know.
And no, you didn't.
I shall return to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011), sees things differently.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history", he says.
The walls of Pompeii's houses are adorned with Latin graffiti about boredom, dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After a long reading of the research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do something satisfying but not being able to do it".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
Apathy, on the other hand, is not an impulse to do something.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbance in the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and a feeling that time is passing by slowly".
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even when we just have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape on which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud television program from the next room that had nothing to do with the content, others heard it at such a low volume that it was barely audible, while the third group heard none of the sounds at all.
The people who listened to the barely audible television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for it, and attributed their trouble to boredom.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or strenuous task, attention deficit disorder can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you do something monotonous - "like looking for defective products on a factory conveyor belt - music can be a distraction and help you to avoid feeling bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that groping and doodling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat it by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wander around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a thunderous speaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boredom susceptibility scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely than girls to be bored, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty relaxed bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32% of teenagers were bored at school and doing their homework, while 23% reported being bored when they were not at school.
Yet only 3 percent of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentages of boredom have gone up or down.
He is, however, sure that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have little influence over their daily routines.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it leads people to take extreme physical risks and to resort to gambling or drugs to alleviate them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have studied the relationship between boredom and creativity, as has Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"Boring is a way for the brain to tell you to do something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's best to do right now.
When you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you're happy.
But while television may produce feelings of happiness in the short term, these feelings fade in the long run.
So while handing a bored child an iPad may help him to get over his boredom, it has not taught him to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
He adds: "Self-control is a skill that is passed on from one situation to another".
Not only does the child learn to talk, but he also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We should also not be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable outside the constant rush of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"It sounds like we need to get bored more often, but boredom is the agonizing, incessant desire to do something meaningful", he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to shut down and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, it is difficult to keep busy once the noise has subsided".
In Colorado , there is no clear guideline for the new marijuana law .
Nineteen-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: possession of a few marijuana sticks and a pipe he used to smoke them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar, near the Kansas border, one day in September when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - felonies punishable by a $100 fine each - and given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals", says Orozco.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of marijuana-related offenses are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
Police authorities will no longer prosecute adults over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legal once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative counties have announced they're continuing to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to ban new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation is moving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is considered to be ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is a good place to get a lead", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Regulatory Commission.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow", he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6th, marking the end of a gray area where the state licensing system does not yet exist but possession is legal.
And uncomfortable practical issues need to be addressed during this time - such as how to reconcile the government's requirement for "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 yards of schools, parks, playgrounds, and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be harder to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora staff stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses involving individuals over the age of 21, and that the police would not seek criminal charges for these offenses "immediately".
Chief Oates added that police would continue to enforce municipal regulations to regulate medical marijuana growers and continue to pursue drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a more hardline view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to get users to quit.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the offense", Buck said in a statement.
Reactions are mixed even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to drop all outstanding property litigation.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time trying to enforce the law until it changes", he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the beginning that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state fueled a deep division among local officials about the big green experiment.
For district attorneys, there is a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana offenders in court and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for legalization that they still cannot accept it", he believes.
The first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol are Colorado and Washington, which are being touted as national models for legalizing drugs.
As advocates and government officials prepare for an era of legal marijuana sales, they are also anxiously awaiting directions from the federal government to continue to criminalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope the Justice Department will back down.
Despite several high-profile arrests of medical marijuana users and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that while criminal prosecutors are unlikely to break into doors to seize smaller quantities of the drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado aren't even waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, even though they could not open for another year or so.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, passed a six-month ban, which will likely be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license somebody and then have a big problem at the federal level", said city councilman Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
We are guided by what the community has decided, not by what the state has decided.
There are still many questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm a Tory.
It is not only university students today who are attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended that university that I once thought was the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization -- free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of entering Worcester College in the late 1980's - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again, and thus caused the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with classmates having sex in the next room.
Author A.N. Wilson mischievously explained that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I was systematically bullied and threatened.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been bullied for one reason only - one that seemed all the more narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I bringing this up now?
Well, recent reports are that a new generation of students on the moderate right is suffering similar persecution.
The organised and growing hatred of Tory students in Oxford has now reached such proportions that a group of them last week called for equal protection for gays, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked, and marginalized".
They're asking for a seat on their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was made worse by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
It featured a graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Oxford University student union, in a Rolls-Royce, sporting a silver suit and silver-plated cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being considered "scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees".
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the conservative student union at Nottingham University, told a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing left-wing tendency at universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student in Corpus Christi who initiated the request for greater protection, believes such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of Oxford's conservative student union, says she has observed a growing rejection of moderate-right students among JCR members.
"This is a danger to intellectual discourse and to the wellbeing of members", she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was in that minority.
I arrived in September 1986 as an incredibly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
The university had voted last year to disqualify Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared even Stalinists.
In the first few days of the first semester, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a taste of what was to come.
I found that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even happily participated in it.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the government's rejection of sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa found their way into the wooden-panelled rooms of the tutorials.
My first of these events was to translate 18th-century French texts into English, and I wasn't prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "translate the first paragraph, please".
I tripped.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite obnoxious.
"Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students chuckled.
Tears filled my eyes.
"I suggest you take a few French lessons in your free time - if you're not too busy with your social activities", Pitt growled at me.
I went back to my room with my head hanging down.
That night, I was sitting alone at the college dinner table when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student union.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is harassed.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be Labour.
I tried to impersonate him later at a local pub.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick was to prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics who had ironically attended Eton College, which was considered conservative, said to me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're dirty. You're not clean.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" someone asked me.
They're beating each other up, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and have to suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years ahead of me stretched before my mental eye into a purgatory of banishment and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based at my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents' house, and I found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said in a low voice.
They would never do that, not in my city of dream towers.
Even my Communist friends always had good manners.
His wet eyes were clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory, had given in to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, where another history teacher had seriously claimed that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly ashamed, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me, calling me "old fool".
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who struck the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week for the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my hoods gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a weeping limp.
But no 18-year-old should ever be subjected to such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic is that it was Oxford -- a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but that still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture" which opened this week in London, ABC will speak with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of Valentino - Master of Couture, a grand retrospective that features more than 130 Haute Couture dresses created by his "Maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stifling and distant world of the nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the most distinguished aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from humble fashion designer in the northern Italian city of Voghera to international jet set idol.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't kick their dicks out on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all very happy to be invited to his house in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also remembers the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of his apartment, the decorations, the food and the music, was recognizable and felt his influence.
"All the guests felt important and loved", recalls the "top model", who started her career at the 1995 Paris haute couture week.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of mutual love.
He likes people with good manners and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious, 200-foot-long runway that offers a role-change: the user takes the role of the model and walks along the runway to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg radiate.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I remember perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest of the "Gillette" type and a jacket from the autumn/winter 1971-72 collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he brings out our beauty", adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally being old enough to wear one of his evening dresses...
In the late 1990s, it finally came to pass.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a decollete that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not fashion-dependent, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps her evening dresses from the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not just a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were needed to make this ivory-colored silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroidery and a four-and-a-half-meter-long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority on the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture in the late 20th century, "the return to the customers of the upper society".
After years of being marred by the elite's "savoir-être", Valentino is now their best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always been impressed by his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance", admits D'Arenberg.
I saw him last a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace of him".
And this is from a princess...
The world's toughest job: the human work animals of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the volcano's carriers risk their lives and health to carry 70 kilograms of sulfur over steep rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others who work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano on the eastern Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he has to climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfur gas emitted from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking large stones of sulfur, which can weigh up to 130 pounds [70 kg], he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders over the steep stone paths.
Although it is only a quarter mile to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 8,050 feet [2,386 m], the weary carriers take more than 40 minutes to ascend at turtle-like speed, balancing and carefully setting their steps so as not to slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract.
Once at the top, they cut their way through the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and run the gruelingly heavy baskets three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1,850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcano's resources and (never better) its workers since 1960, paying 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilo of sulfur.
They then sell it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 cents), because the mineral is widely used in everyday life to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even sugar bleach.
"We usually carry 70 kilograms [70 lb], so we get about 46,000 rupees [US$3.80, U.S.] each way", explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
He takes three hours to complete each run, and by the end of the day, he has 138,000 rupees.
What seems like a miserable reward for such a barely human effort is three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily wages of the miners here, who are paid 15,000 rupees ($1.50) a day for the coffee harvest and earn an average of two million rupees ($1.90) a month, are very high", explains the porter, who formerly worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (US$6.2), and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, frequent coughs and irritated eyes from the toxic gases.
For three years, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen, where sulfur has already left its first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, frequent coughs and eyes irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay for achieving his dream.
"I'm going to work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than acceptable English.
This nice and intelligent young man, but under sentence of life, could be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he's doing the job of a porter.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up at two o'clock every morning because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color glows blue in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanised sulphur extraction to save costs and has not supplied any equipment to the miners, who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive the 30,000 rupees ($1.50) camera fee that the park's guards charge, along with the 15,000 rupees ($1.50) entrance fee for tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human torso.
"This work is for animals and not for people", protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kilograms and says he will continue "as long as he can", because he needs the money to raise his three children, ages 10 to 18.
I'm not retiring. I'm dying here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and itches the eyes, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick columns rising from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains of serious illnesses... except, of course, the usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, at 53 years old, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Each day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks along a goat trail through the bush to the Tamansari camp, 11 miles [18 km] away.
"I'm not retiring, I'm going to die here because the volcano was my whole life", Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
The eldest of his five children, at age 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but the poverty continues generation after generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world: that of those who work as human burden-bearers on the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame their lack of children on their careers, stress, and the cost of real estate and child rearing.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife: let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a mint candy commercial, but even so - or because of that - they went viral on YouTube earlier this year in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rap song that uses local sayings such as "Showing a bao in the oven is a way of mocking the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, hopes that the commercial will bring attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty".
This is just for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproduction, so we realized that this was an issue we needed to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing pheromone perfume or organizing speed dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why not do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like compose a rap?
Children 1.2
The Singapore government is the one who is not taking this issue lightly.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policy measures to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But so far, little has been achieved.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population agency, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Wei Tan Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Agency, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have much more options in terms of goals and priorities in life, in addition to getting married and starting a family", she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay in marriage and birth, which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to counter population decline has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that have a thinly veiled xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore's ruling party scored its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem by increasing contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small apartments are built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square metres and are very successful.
However, there is concern that they may encourage the single-person lifestyle and discourage construction companies from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They're so popular, and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give clearer guidance to developers who have previously been hindered when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial sector suggest that they will not have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, housing is expensive, and education is expensive, so many people are putting it off", says one young manager.
The kids can have others.
"It's important to me to have my own money and time", says another man in his early twenties.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - there is so much the government can do.
The offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, it is the property of privacy, or "that area of one's private life where one is entitled to protection from any interference".
What's private for someone under 16?
How does this definition apply to his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposing himself to by posting things on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers aged 10 to 15 who are frequent users of the Internet.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal" at a personal level and "on the password and the user" when applying it to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world", he confirms.
I'm posting pictures of pretty things on FB or games.
I also spend my time with friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that wasn't of me or someone who was being a jerk", he says.
The boy is well aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of naked people, of crimes, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to have 35 friends on Facebook and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I logged on to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone will answer me, I just upload them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, and I can quickly talk to distant relatives or friends", he says.
When asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if someone recommended a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in Ask he admits not knowing 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"That doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music", he says.
According to the boy, no one hinted at him or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If someone harasses me or asks me to do it, I simply remove them from my user account", he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend's friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was", he assures us.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He was just doing it privately".
It then explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this youngster would upload photos of people he knew in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if he was unpleasant or I wanted to kick his ass.
"But I know it's cyberbullying", he explains.
The key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that to guide children and young people, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was created as a medium for finding information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, a master's degree holder in education at Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and teenagers who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them when we are still learning", he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion of what can be spread, published or said at an age when maturity is not sufficient".
"They should also be picky when it comes to being popular, having thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and teens about privacy is to ask them thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work", he says.
Porras then goes on to give some possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger.
Or, would you like to see a photo of you posted, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what the others are posting about you?
Did you ask permission from other people before you tagged photos of parties?
And one more question: does everyone have to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet is acting with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must be true for social networks", he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, elementary school teacher, and educational consultant, comments that it is vital that parents carefully review social networking policies.
If they understand all the sections, they will have a solid basis for talking to their children about the importance of having an Internet account.
"For example, age, or what you can share or post", he explains.
Guardia says the kids need to be reminded of the lesson "You're not supposed to talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the UNASUR Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier and was supposed to be signed by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur.Sources in the State and Presidential Office initially said they would hand it over after the examination, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian government website at some point.
When asked about the text, they said that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, the press room only broadcasted the picture of the presidential meeting without sound with the message "private session, limited audio".
The few pieces of information that were circulating among journalists were obtained by the press officers of some of the UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press officer.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of the participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
The Peruvian presidency then sent an email to the media with the summit's "concluding statement", but it was Humala's statement and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the third Summit of South American Arab States (SASA) and, despite press calls, the so-called Lima Declaration announced earlier was not published.
The official website of the ASPA shows that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems were in place for journalists, but they severely restricted access to information.
The summit also ended with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Court of Justice of the Hague which settles a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the International Court of Justice, which opens Monday in The Hague, to hear the pleas of both sides in the Lima v. Santiago trial.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences we are presently presenting to this international court", Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will remain a country that respects international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts", Piñera added, shaking hands with Humala in front of the flags of both countries.
The two presidents confirmed their submission to the ICC after Colombia filed a complaint against the Bogota Convention following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua which it considered a grave error, agreeing to submit to the judgments of that international court.
The summit was attended by the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since the 2011 ouster of its president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit in Lima shortly after noon.
The Head of State read the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions had been taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries had been defined, with a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
He said the decisions taken by the UNASUR countries would "take important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we extend the Residence Decisions".
He said that action would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, and to improve access to low-cost medicines and the Internet in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take a triumphant turn, but serve to expand our production capacity and show our peoples a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects to improve spatial connectivity in South America, especially in rural and border areas...thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms", the Peruvian president said in a statement read out.
Among these projects were five Peruvian projects, which are located on the cross-axes of his territory from the coast to Brazil, and two of which are to provide better connectivity with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasised at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he began his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in Mexico on Saturday to deal with the maritime conflict respectfully following a ruling by the ICC that was questioned by Bogotá.
"I will probably meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)", Santos said.
He said that the EU had to be prepared to take on board the new challenges and that the EU had to be prepared to take on board the new challenges.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will handle this matter as civilized and respectful as possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are due to meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers also met in advance to adopt the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the region's defence.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from the integration of its citizens", says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with which "South America can actually learn something from Europe".
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans "killed each other in World War II and other conflicts" and "are practically a homeland today".
In this sense, he defended the project of creating a South American citizenship that the member states of Unasur are pushing forward.
'Freedom of movement for citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to the past,' he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon countries and taking into account those that have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
The teachers never make a commitment, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and is funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because he did not betray his principles, but he followed his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were 'reasonable grounds to believe that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his case would not be followed'.
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to be interrogated on its territory for an alleged sexual offence, while 'Swedish law allows this to be done by videoconference, which could have been done via the Ecuadorian embassy in London'.
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be affected.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he has a mild lung problem, but not a serious one", the Ecuadorian head of state said.
However, there is a risk of physical and psychological harm because he is confined in a confined space and cannot exercise outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person", he added.
Correa said the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was to grant him a free pass to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in different European courts", he explained.
And if Britain grants this waiver tomorrow, I think that's settled.
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish law allows and has been done in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa took the opportunity to assert himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the malice and the lies that undermine freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself that Ecuador is no longer ruled by such journalists "nor by the bankers or hegemonic and squat bourgeois countries", and predicted that if re-elected "he will deepen the revolution to continue on the path in this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must remain tough and must not give in to opportunism and a coup disguised as legal" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay".
The President of Ecuador also considers that his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, is 'absolutely justified' in wanting to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favoured Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
This judgment is not currently being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be addressed comprehensively so that they can be overcome and looked at in the future.
He also hoped that the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile would be settled by the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh".
Regarding the possibility of him running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive term, he said he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from political life.
I have never personally been interested in power, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this probable victory, so I have to fulfill this responsibility", he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, after which I will retire from public life.
This is true even if we lose.
"That's decided", he explained.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to the Vice President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he had traveled there for a scheduled, routine treatment, and that he was expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any way mean a relapse in President Chávez's health", he commented.
The Ecuadorian President took part today in Lima in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of one AIDS death today is too late to be identified
Fabrizio was 21 years old when his test result was confirmed: HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb went off", he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "weaken" with no apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to educate himself about it, and he did so with such dedication that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he entered in 1994 after several struggles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At the time, even the director of one IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end".
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic unaware of their illness, and in whom the virus has already done damage and depleted their immune systems, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the world's first reported cases of AIDS, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time is exactly the same as that of the general population", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the HCG, adding that this information was backed up by a respected scientific publication in April of this year.
Infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva said that scientists have concluded since 2008 that while AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the people's immune system when they start treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent have a better chance: up to 30 years with a CD4 count of 200 and 50 years with a CD4 count of 500.
Simply put, the above statements mean that a person diagnosed HIV-positive at age 25 can "live to be 75 without any problems, as long as it is under control", he explained.
To properly classify this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even though the death rate has fallen significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of AIDS deaths has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and as of May this year, 187 have died, but it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- So why are people still dying?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and this is how it is in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we have not had a problem with the supply of medicines, but the problem is that people come in very advanced stages because they don't know their infection, which is very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of 10 patients come to us with an underlying infection, and to affect global mortality, we need earlier detection, which means that we need to offer massive screening to all those who need it".
This proposal is supported by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (State Committee for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco) and also by patients like Fabrizio, who had his test done in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had made a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi's sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), one of the common complications.
Everything's different when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die, and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times", they say in my case.
The change was to better myself, I eat well, exercise and take my medication.
Today, his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and the health of the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO to encourage those who are afraid today on World AIDS Day.
They should get tested if they're at risk, and the sooner they know if they're HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are huge gaps between health programs and the average citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has covered HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this purpose, "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; they used to be given out individually, now they give us packages of a hundred, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom", he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a common mocking question from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy workers and health care workers who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution, with condoms not just being located behind the counter but in dispensers in public toilets in facilities frequented by young people.
Promiscuity is not to be promoted.
It is not to pay for the beer and the motel, as Governor Emilio González said when asked if condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not like that; the best thing to do is to bring condoms closer to those who are already having sex", he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of cases are sexually transmitted, 6% are blood-borne and 2% perinatal.
It's estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV because for every recorded case, there are four or five people who don't know it.
The United States Court of Appeals upheld a ruling not to recognize the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities, which was achieved through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, setting a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So you could say that the procedures for the survival of companies that Mexican laws allow are not valid in the land of stars and stripes, in violation of international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale on June 15 in the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies helpless to face the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door for Mexico's largest glassmaker to appeal to the United States Supreme Court over three inconsistencies.
While the judge in the case points out that the creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, based in New Orleans, says first that the main proceedings concern commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, using the American Law Institute as a mediator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies, after the recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate, which Vitro's subsidiaries had with their parent company, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, in vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities to group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who brought the case against Vitro before the United States courts, i.e. the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37 percent.
The Court of Appeal does not take this into account.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country hard.
The González Sada family therefore appeals to the same Court of Appeal to have the vote taken in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal is filed, seeking review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The Court of First Instance, in its judgment of 14 December 1997, in Case T-48/98, T-48/98, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48/99, T-48 T-48/99, T-48 T-48 T-48 T-48 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49 T-49
It is also noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-way car bombs: a blow to the in vitro and to the country.
The general balance sheet
After months of unsuccessful complaints by the Mexican airline unions against the former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Pilot Union) has finally made progress.
The petition, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of obstruction of justice.
The Authority has systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the operator to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 depositary account of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid is compatible with the internal market.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the major shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Caribbean University forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society decided to form a broad front to oppose the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In the meantime, the Canacintra (the national chamber of manufacturing) has managed to unite the governors in the southeast to oppose the monumental installation that destroyed partly protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead.
Because the government has not complied with a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by the acronym ACTA, the matter has already been closed, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, Homex, a construction company, is marketing 500 million pesos worth of stock certificates.
The issue is the first of four similar issues that promise an interest payment every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
A group of companies, formed by the leading information technology companies NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, was set up under the name Competival, with the aim of serving the software cluster market in Central and South America.
The investment in this area is over 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
World-renowned basketball player Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been involved in basketball for over 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a vast intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes spent six years in the sport, playing in the lower leagues, the first national league, representing and managing the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón and as president of the Basketball Association.
"I've worn many hats in basketball my whole life, even several at once when I was president of the BSN, CEO of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s", Reyes recalled when Primera Hora visited him at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career, and they testify to it.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player to 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or CEO of the club.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I was part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as general manager, co-manager or coach.
It was a lot of fulfilling years, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From then on, Cuco took over from Ortiz, who was a very good manager", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here and who worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, saying to me, "I have a very strong, six-foot-tall player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was a naturalized citizen and one of our best pitchers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made a championship possible for Bayamon, Gausse would have made another.
The Vaqueros with Gausse championship was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the association in 1988.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's executions on the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze, if it hadn't been for that Canadian referee who let us repeat the last move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was that group from the 1990 World Cup the best national team you ever saw?
She's one of the best, like the one that won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the 1991 Pan American Games team in Cuba, where we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fight, like when they won bronze against us in the World Cup.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were back in that team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not play in 1990 due to a knee injury.
One team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina, in 1995.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruiter as substitutes for the players suspended for the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level like Piculín.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he's played in.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question to ask.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best thing you've done in the league?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which in the early 1990s included up to 17 teams in a season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
Like the boys in Ponce, they only play in their territory and they only play in the national playoffs against teams from other parts of the island.
Today, children travel and play unnecessarily.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch YouTube videos of music from my time, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". on the television series Dallas, where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of the greed of the '80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family news release to The Associated Press from Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he was once again playing the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played Hagman's wife in the original and sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted to drinking heavily over the years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before Dallas, Hagman became known on television as a nice guy in the 1965-1970 NBC sitcom Charming Jeannie.
There he played astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Genie" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly despicable J.R. That made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other figures in their environment aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot J.R.?" commercial, which was meant to create anticipation for an emotional episode where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered at bookmakers.
The series thus reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1990 episode, it was watched by an average of 41 million viewers, making "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, J.R.'s sister-in-law, who shot him.
J.R. had her pregnant and threatened to expose her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were other reasons to want him dead.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a treacherous businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to institutionalize his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what to put on J.R.'s headstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the Honorable Citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge personality on and off screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of admirers around the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago on the TNT television channel with great success.
Filming for five episodes of the second season was completed and a sixth episode was in the works, the network said.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how the loss of Hagmann would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their homes.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything that I thought would hurt or affect anyone in any way", he told The Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became involved in liver donation and volunteered at a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I counsel them, I encourage them, I meet with them when their operations are coming up and after", he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religion professor decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishing hook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have dubbed "Deudarmageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor teaching courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which should be the last in history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We are analysing why these ideas spread over time", he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behaviour.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
"I tried to inform the students about what is possible, likely, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to offer a course simply titled "The End of the World".
"We are not recording 2012 so that we always have the option of resetting course in case the world doesn't end", said Restall.
Despite the "imminent doom", students must study, write projects and take final exams.
Penn State's final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to "work until the night when the world supposedly ends", said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours, there were no more seats", said Restall of his high-school class, which filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the semester started, we received e-mails from students asking if there were any seats available.
The students, for their part, assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Rutgers Camden student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or lack of it.
25-year-old psychology and nursing student Will Wekesa says he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class that teaches this", he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone a professor - declared that they believed in the December 21 deadline.
"Our first project was on the Mayan prophecy, and in a way we're discrediting it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has fueled this speculation.
"Other places, people don't think that way", he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would take a course on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not part of the end of the world", he wrote, suggesting a higher court exception.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years there was much talk of the Last Judgment, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call some friends and we can laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
