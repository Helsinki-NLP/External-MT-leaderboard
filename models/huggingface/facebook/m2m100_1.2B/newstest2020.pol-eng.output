Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in white clothes
He is charismatic.
At the holy Mass for liberation and healing he celebrates crowds.
He was a few years old when something unexplained began to happen in his life.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
At the Holy Mass for Liberation and Healing celebrated by O. Witko, crowds are coming
One day, the parents of a 7-month-old child came to him with a 7.5mm hole in the heart.
He should have been operated.
Father Josef Witko prayed for him.
The same day the boy was taken to the hospital for treatment.
Surprised, the doctors said: “Operation is not necessary, the loss is only 1.5 mm.”
My parents were crying of happiness.
After another prayer, the Franciscan hole disappeared entirely.
The spiritual extraordinary actions of the Creator began to experience as a teenager.
In his dreams, the purifying souls came to him to ask for help.
I was awakened at night and urged to pray for the dead and those who were dying at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what is happening to a man who commits a mortal sin.
“My body began to change.
I lost human qualities and started to look like an animal,” she says.
An invisible force lifted him up, he could not make a voice out of himself.
He felt he was lost.
Then God showed him salvation.
“Drained in the waters of the river symbolizing the holy baptism, I was released and returned to human form...”
He didn’t tell anyone about his strange experiences.
It was a calling in it.
He was 16 years old when he joined the Franciscans.
In his sermons he didn’t just talk about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience Him alive.
Charismatic Community of the Renewal in the Holy Spirit
At the Mass for healing celebrated by Father Witko, many people attend who hope to get rid of the disease.
However, the cleric emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
Kolping's first defeat FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26) afternoon, the team of Kolping FRAC deserved to be home to the current champion of Poland Dartom Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Super League of Table Tennis.
The Yaroslavl in such a personal ranking as they presented with the Grodzistans, have little chance of winning with the sovereigns of the league.
He played a duel with Dart Bogoria.
The team’s leader is Chen Jingqi.
Per with him in the composition of the Yaroslavl would reach for the third consecutive triumph in the new season.
Young Asian Qiyao Han probably hasn’t grown up yet to win against souls like Greek Panagiotis Gionis or Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, namely Mark Badowski.
The player from Hellady was the biggest star of the duel in the MOSiR hall near Sikorski Street in Yaroslavl.
Both in the confrontation with Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei was a class for himself.
After three duels, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowski, and Daniel Górak after an exciting, five-set fight – Pavel Sirucko.
But then it was worse.
Gionis did not give Leia a chance.
You could still hope to win for two points, but Qiyao Han did not meet Badowski.
There will be no additional studies for seniors.
Why ?
According to the announcement of Rafał Trzaskowski, in Warsaw was to be introduced a program of free preventive tests for seniors aged 70 and 80.
However, the idea will not be implemented because it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its subordinate Agency for the Protection of Medical Technologies and Tarification.
The agency explained that the target group was poorly selected.
“The above actions may even result in the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to aggravating the difficulties in accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false-positive test result.”
The decision is not understood by the head of state.
“The money is ours, we have the money for it.
Only the government is afraid that if people are examined, they will later go to the doctor, which is absurd, because it is just about leading to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
All experts know that it helps when it comes to burdening the health system, because it helps in the rapid detection of diseases and in a reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand,” said Rafał Trzaskowski.
“It’s hard for me to imagine that experienced specialists say, ‘Let’s not be examined, because there will be longer queues with the doctor, and if such specialists advise the government, then I’m not surprised that this is the state of the health service,” he added.
Palestinians respond to Israel: We will break all agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Thursday at the UN General Assembly he would break any agreements with Israel if the future government of the country attempts to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge to annex occupied Palestinian lands.
“If the future government of Israel, whatever it arises, proceeds to implement this plan, we will cancel all signed agreements (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made,” he said.
“We will completely and completely reject the entire plan,” Abbas threatened.
“It is our duty to defend all our rights by all possible means – no matter what the consequences will be – by fully engaging in the enforcement of international law and in the fight against terrorism,” he said in a statement.
Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister, was re-elected after the September 17 election to form a government.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would announce the annexation of the Jordan Valley and intend to incorporate all Jewish settlements in the West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, then led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also vowed to hold general elections in Palestine.
The last one took place in 2006.
“When I return home, I will hold local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, and all who oppose them will be held accountable before God and the international community,” he said.
In his speech, Abbas defended the rights of Palestine, regarded as a permanent observer in the UN, to exercise the powers of “full members of the UN and all its bodies and institutions.”
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to “force Israel to comply with the resolutions of the United Nations with full respect.”
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas’ speech, stating that the Palestinian leader “will focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority’s efforts against Israel rather than fighting calls for terrorism in the Authority under his leadership.”
Danon, however, noted that he did not refer to Netanyahu’s announcement of the annexation of occupied Palestinian lands.
Rescue workers want defibrillators at neuralgic points
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save human lives.
The State Emergency Rescue Station in Przemyśl wants such devices to be located in the city’s neuralgic points.
The officers received congratulatory diplomas from the Provincial Emergency Rescue Station in Przemyśl.
Applicant Daniel Cyrnek, senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpacki Customs Office in Przemyśl.
On August 28, they served at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medice. A Customs and Treasury Service official noticed an unconscious man lying in a pedestrian traffic zone.
The Chinese activist died in prison as a result of torture.
To exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution.
Cao Shuxia, the activist’s wife, was called by a Communist Party secretary from her native village on September 23 to inform her that her husband had just died at a military hospital in Hengyang.
What caused his death, he did not reveal.
In the bar, Cao saw her husband’s body massacred, unrecognizable.
“His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in blood,” the woman said.
“They didn’t let me take my cell phones with me, and there were a lot of policemen around me who didn’t let me get close to Wang.”
Police pressured them to sign a statement stating that the husband was seriously ill and died as a result of a “unfortunate accident”.
$105 million for video game companies from the National Center for Research and Development
Nearly PLN 105 million will be funded to companies from the gaming industry, creating innovative solutions.
The National Center for Research and Development announced on Friday the results of the 3rd edition of the GameINN program.
Among the 30 projects supported by NCBR was the development of a platform for field-based gaming based on an AR game engine that creates a real-world map with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test-training platform for verifying practical skills at work and professional improvement using VR and AI; an innovative game simulating real-world production management using a ground-breaking gaming model based on the interaction of the virtual world with the real-world using the concept of Industry 4.0.
The aim of the GameINN sector program is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game manufacturers sector in the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game industry is already growing at a rate of 10 percent annually.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 amounted to PLN 1.85 billion, and the forecast for 2019 is 2.23 billion.
“The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the support for entrepreneurs already reaching PLN 300 million under this sectoral programme constitute an important impetus for the continued, dynamic growth of the Polish gamedev,” the statement reads.
The video game industry is an excellent example of the efficient use of the potential we have in Poland.
“The government’s incentives for innovative entrepreneurs, such as R&D discounts, competence improvement programmes, IP box and NCBR support programmes drive the innovative activities of companies and allow them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market,” said Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education.
The head of the science department points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project co-financing, but also remains in their pockets – three-quarters more entrepreneurs benefited from the R&D relief in 2018 than a year earlier.
The amount of deducted costs for B+R operations amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which provided more than PLN 300 million savings for companies benefiting from this relief.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by the NCBR in three editions of GameINN,” said the Deputy Prime Minister.
Director of the NCBR, Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki, recalls that in the previous two competitions, funding of a total value of more than PLN 211.2 million was awarded to 78 innovative projects.
The huge interest in the third competition and the variety of applications submitted show that the video game industry has the ideas and competences to further develop and enhance its competitive advantage.
“We are pleased that among the projects that have emerged – like in previous editions – there are projects on solutions that serve not only entertainment, but also related to Industry 4.0,” he adds.
In the third GameINN competition, entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units could apply for funding of up to PLN 20 million.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of approximately 317 million PLN.
The competition budget at the time of the announcement of the competition was PLN 100 million, but was increased, so that 27 projects were granted almost PLN 105 million in co-financing.
Detailed information about the results of the 3rd GameINN contest is available on the website ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sector program is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Program.
NCBR launched the program in 2016 in response to the initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga Admits to Stealing Kasper Dolberg Watch
The incident occurred on September 16.
Dolberg, who travelled from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice in late August, noticed after training that his clock had disappeared from his dressing room.
It is worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish man did not appear in class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
It was mysterious from the beginning.
Football players in the dressing room have private safe at their disposal, and the club’s terrain is monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga admitted to the robbery.
The 18-year-old has already apologized to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised to return the money for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young players in France.
He came to Nice at the age of thirteen, to debut in the first team three years later.
He played seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but – as by the newspaper “L’Equipe” – the club is likely to terminate it with immediate effect.
He has initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player.
Nice, at least officially, declined to comment on the matter.
Check if you wash your hands properly.
We all know that they need to be washed (e.g. after coming home or before eating).
But not everyone knows that in order to actually get rid of germs, you need to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for washing enough to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands.
Most of us are washing less.
Just warm water and regular soap – it is not true that it has to be antibacterial (many doctors even discourage it).
When washing, we rub not only the bottom and top of the hands, but also: the toes (combined or individually) – rub them with circular movements on the inside of the other hand, the spaces between the fingers (wrapping hands, rubbing fingers on each other), thumbs – each thumb we embrace with the other hand and in such an embrace we turn it for a moment to the right and left.
In an emergency situation (when you cannot wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet towel, and then use an antibacterial gel (in pharmacies, from 5 PLN).
After using the public toilet, do not touch the doors or doors with washed hands (recommendation of the Health Inspectorate).
Open it with a paper towel.
Iran's president says he has rejected a proposal for talks with the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not hold talks with the U.S. during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the U.S. offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hasan Rowhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump has commented that it was the Iranian side that requested the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the US has offered to lift all sanctions imposed on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran’s nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rohani: Iran will not negotiate under maximum pressure
The Iranian president said he refused to hold the talks because of the “toxic atmosphere.”
He said he met with U.S. diplomats because he suffered pressure from France, Germany and Britain.
However, he stressed that Iran will not conduct talks in an atmosphere of “maximum pressure.”
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in the 5+1 format, nobody can predict what the final outcome will be," Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader said he did not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European parties to the nuclear deal of favouring U.S. sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal “are a prerequisite that does not allow” for dialogue.
If we can remove this prerequisite and if America lifts sanctions and maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America,” he said.
He added that he did not rule out a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, although he did not agree to such a conversation at the United Nations General Assembly last week.
Trump: Iran asked, I said no
Donald Trump tweeted that he had rejected the Iranian request.
“Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them so that we could meet.
Of course I said ‘no!’,” the US president tweeted.
Tensions in the nuclear deal
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to ease tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 Iran agreement they were signatories to.
In exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions, Iran will give up its nuclear weapons program and submit the nuclear sector to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the withdrawal of the United States from the agreement in May 2015, the other signatories have repeatedly confirmed that they want to keep the agreement in place.
So far nothing has come out of it.
Washington uses the tactic of putting maximum pressure on Iran, and the sanctions include a full oil embargo on Iran.
Tehran has said that if it does not get permission to export raw materials, it will reduce its obligations under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the District Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of heather Emilia, who – according to her words and screens from WhatsApp – participated in the stalking against the judges, was resumed on Wednesday for judgment by the NSA.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him, and therefore there is no basis to uphold the order of WSA President Wojciech Mazur to remove him from his duties.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation against Schmidt in late August, but it has not yet turned into an investigation against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the WSA president’s decision within a month of its issue.
In this situation, the judge, who publicly spoke about his wife’s psychological problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office due to suspicion of participation in the heather group, will return to the judgment and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Schmidt denies his involvement in the hexagonal group.
He claims that there is no evidence for this except for fake screens and the words of his wife, with whom he is divorced.
Exactly the same is stated by the other judges associated with the “Casta”: they are all innocent, there is no evidence.
Maybe they’ll bet on their own.
Because the prosecutor's office did not tick a finger to secure evidence from their electronic media, it is also silent about the contents of Emilia Schmidt's phone, which the phone stopped in June in another case.
Police did not tick a finger to secure the devices of persecutors, who were identified as persecutors in a February report by judge Waldemar Żurek.
There is no evidence – there is no Schmidt case, there is no “Casta” case.
There is also no case for the head of NIK Marian Banasia to rent the stone house to the sutners and hide the income.
The CBA checks his asset statements.
He will check when he checks.
The Parliamentary Ethics Commission will not deal with Banasi, because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Commission has somehow gathered to make a curious decision on dismissing Banasi’s deputy lawyers and appointing his lawyer, although the law does not provide for such a strange combination).
The whole reminds me of a movie novel, probably American, about how a wife comes home and finds her husband with her lover in bed.
She is so upset and upset that she can’t say a word.
He stands at the door of the wardrobe, and during this time the lover quickly jumps out of bed, clothes up and goes out.
My husband breaks the bed.
When the wife recovers her voice and cries: What is it?
Who is this woman?
My husband asks me, “What kind of woman, my dear?”
Only in the case of “Casta” or “Banasia” is a parody of the state.
And that is not funny at all.

Kamila Lićwinko in the final jump
Earlier this season returning to the competition after a maternal break, the bronze medalist of the 2017 World Championship in London, defeated 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92 in the second.
It was only achieved at 1.94 in the third approach.
“I am pleased.
I showed that I could fight because the first attempt was completely unsuccessful.
In the final I will have to jump better technically,” she admitted to the Eurosport camera Lićwinko.
The best qualifiers were the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karyna Demidik with 1.94.
Both players were the only ones who didn’t hit any heights.
The women’s final is scheduled for Monday.
Start at 19.30 Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is hospitalized in severe condition
He was admitted to hospital and his condition is described by doctors as serious.
He is conscious and conscious.
“We hope that he will win again.
We all pray that he will recover,” a close anonymous person, Kornel Morawiecki, told reporters at the “Super Express”.
In the upcoming elections, the Prime Minister’s father will run for the Senate.
“I am kept alive by my closest family and politicians,” Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview he gave to reporters of the “Super Express” two weeks ago.
In January, “Super Express” that the 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been sent to the Military Hospital in Wroclaw for examination.
“I had strange, disturbing symptoms and I went to the hospital.
I think I have yellow.
The worst was ahead of me.
When I was examined with a computer tomograph, it was found that I had pancreatic cancer,” the prime minister’s father said.
A few days later, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation at the MSWiA Hospital in Warsaw.
According to Moraviecki, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, priest Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and went well.
I know a lot of people have prayed for me, for which I am very grateful.
Fortunately, I don’t have any metastases.
I don’t know if I’m going to have chemotherapy.
I give myself to the hands of specialists who are rather good-thinking.
For now, after this difficult operation, I have to return to some usability state.
I hope that everything will be fine,” Kornel Morawiecki said in a January interview with “SE”.
“If I were to go too late, the situation would be tragic and I would say goodbye to the fall,” he said.

She was last seen at the Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklossa is 14 years old, 167 cm tall, has blonde hair and gray-blue eyes.
When she was last seen, she was wearing a shirt, gray pants and shoes.

The power of jumping.
The title of the report from the amateur sports competitions, played on Sunday afternoon 15 September on the hippodrome on Oleandry Street in Olav, may be confusing for some.
The way to real power is a long way, but this is the name of one of the types of horse competition.
The power jump competition involves the rider and the horse overcoming ever-higher obstacles that in the most prestigious international competitions exceed up to two meters.
The long-standing and still unbeaten world record, set in 1949 by the Chilean Albert Larraguibel, on the horse "Huaso", is 247 cm.
So high in Olav, of course, no one jumped, but the score of the best local amazons at 135 cm is also not the worst.
The competitions organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other JKS activists “In the Seedle” were a showcase part of the “Rainbow Riding Competitions” played there a little earlier, which we write more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
The competition was attended by eight amazons, training riding in the Olavsk JKS.
Four were competing on dogs and four on large horses.
In the first group, the best was Nikola Szołdra, who performed the crazy "Sprinter".
This small but dynamic wheelchair began by overcoming obstacles spread at a height of 40 cm and ended only at the station with the upper beam 125 cm away from the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive refusals was removed from the competition by the jury.
The second place was held by Amelia Pawlak, who performed “Famy”, and the third place was held by Lena Boruń on “Harmider”.
Ambitiously fought the youngest participant of the tournament - Inga Aksman, galoping and jumping through obstacles on the small carpet "Carmen".
Even more excitement was accompanied by the start-up amazons and spectators during the competition with large horses.
Dangerously-looking falls included Paulina Shevczyk, who accompanied the “Declaration” and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the “Lotka”.
Fortunately, except for minor crashes, neither the amazons nor the horses had anything wrong, so they continued to participate in the competition.
A lot of problems with the introduction of the young "Wineta" on the park had Weronika Łuczkiewicz.
It was either a coach’s assist, or another horse for the pair, behind which a little crazy “Vineta” was mocking.
After overcoming the obstacle from the parkour, she also descended in full swing, so at times it was dangerous in the boxes and on the stretch. "Everything is under control!" reassured Jan Sienkiewicz some of the scared spectators, especially the youngest.
Since the beginning of the competition of large horses, Marta Masalska, who is a beautifully presenting “Whisky”, has been well-written on the parkour.
This worthy knight, coupled with an experienced Amazon, after the second approach in the final phase as the first jumped 135 cm and this was the best result at the time of the competition.
After a while, however, the same height was also recorded by Paulina Szewczyk on “Declaration”, Weronika Łuczkiewicz on “Vineta” and Anastasia Abramenko on “Lotka”.
To decorate the flo and to receive real prizes in the form of riding equipment, all these competitors went together, and in the end, together with the amazons on the puppets in the takt of Radecki’s march, they performed an effective honorary round, ending these interesting and exciting competitions.
Thanksgiving
The Riding Sports Club “W Siodle” cordially thanks the sponsors of the jump power competition during the XVI “Riding Rainbow Competition”: the City Office in Olav, the Water Supply and Sewage Factory in Olav, the County Mayor and the company “Mustang”.
Max Kolonko, The Patriot Revolution by Max Kolonko
KWW Max Kolonko’s Patriotic Revolution is the name of the electoral committee under which Marius Max Kolonko’s #R Revolution political formation was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution directed its proposal especially to young right-wing voters.
Prior to the election, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiak or Pavel Kukiz, but none of these coalitions occurred, and the KWW Patriotic Revolution Max Kolonko himself was not even able to gather enough signatures to issue letters in any polish electoral district.
Now Kolonko announced on Twitter that he has terminated cooperation with KWW Max Kolonko's Patriotic Revolution.
“I’m going to wait for my name to be deleted.
I kindly ask you not to connect my person with the aforementioned entity,” he added and announced that he will provide more information soon.
It is not yet known whether the journalist will continue his activity or whether it will be the end of the #R Revolution formation.
On July 4, on American Independence Day, journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political formation – #R Revolution.
In recent years, Kolonko has become famous for running the YouTube channel Max TV, on which he commented on events in Poland and around the world.
“We’ve had enough of politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It is time for the authority in the state to be taken over by the people and ruled for the good of the people,” Kolonko said.
The party’s agenda included, among other things, issues relating to the judiciary (it should be elected in general elections), tax changes (equalizing the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military assistance to the countries of the eastern flank of NATO, with a special focus on Poland), the holding of a referendum on weapons, the limitation of the number of deputies or the introduction of single-mandate electoral districts.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political formation, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiak.
In late July, Kolonko posted on his social media profile a message suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15 movement.
However, none of these coalitions eventually succeeded.
UBS: Gold close to balance
“The euro will remain around the threshold of 4.35 zlotys in the coming months, which will be accompanied by weak economic conditions in the global markets,” said Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
“The expectations ofining a solid pace of economic growth and a stable monetary policy speak in favour of stabilizing gold quotations at the current ceiling,” the expert said in an interview with Bankier.pl.
Despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council will not decide to raise interest rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are softening policy.
“While gold is properly valued – euro quotations should remain around the ceiling of PLN 4.35 in the coming months – Polish bonds are not attractive, according to him.
Much more favorable yields than Polish securities are offered by bonds from emerging markets,” said Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to experts, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
“The global slowdown may continue, but there should not be a severe recession, or at least a slightly below-zero GDP,” Bolliger said.
“Investors should be discouraged by global actions, which may be harmed by the lack of prospects for a settlement of the US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment procedure of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Among the stock markets, Europe should be the relatively weakest,” says Mark Haefele, chief executive of UBS Wealth Management, in the latest letter to investors.
“Eurozone stocks should behave worse than U.S. stocks because they are more vulnerable to increased uncertainty surrounding global trade and fears of a slowdown,” the report said.
According to Michael Boliger, after the hose in the bond markets of the safest countries pushed the yield of the German 10-year even to minus 0.74%, it is still possible to deepen the decline in yield.
However, the long-term profitability of long-term securities should no longer decline, but only short-term securities, due to the easing of bank monetary policy.
The Fed has the biggest room for interest rate cuts, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency in the horizon of the coming years.
The long-term balance point for euro quotations is the $1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19-percent potential strengthening of the single currency against the dollar.
We expect further Fed interest rate cuts, which will result in a reduction in global monetary policy disparities.
“The long-term strength of the dollar may not be allowed by current and budget deficits,” says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr loses its weapons.
Confidential report of German MON
Since the beginning of 2014, the Bundeswehr has recorded the disappearance of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of weapons and 19,445 pieces of ammunition, according to a confidential report compiled by the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation.
This was by the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
According to a document from the office of the parliamentary secretary of state at MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two arms, one part of the weapons and 3,474 pieces of ammunition have so far been recovered.
Among the military equipment that is still missing are: six MG3 universal machine guns, 11 G3 automatic rifles, four G36 automatic rifles, six signal pistols and two P8 pistols.
In addition, there are 30 fighters missing for the MG3 machine guns.
This was stated by Left Party Vice-President Martin Renner.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing arms and ammunition is “stunning.”
As a result of the investigation, only a small part of the missing equipment was found.
Martina Renner summarized the effects of these actions as a “bad balance sheet.”
She also criticized the fact that the list does not indicate whether there is a weapon found there during the investigation against Bundeswehr Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the federal prosecutor’s office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence threatening state security and violating the provisions of the firearm law.
The officer was accused of preparing attacks on leading German politicians on far-right and racist grounds.
His “black list” of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor’s office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights activist and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco A. illegally took possession of four pieces of firearms, more than 1,000 pieces of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Children crying in the plane.
How to avoid them?
There is solution
Japan Airlines has recently introduced a feature designed for those whose travelling with a crying child is a nightmare.
Through the airline’s website, it is possible to check the seats on the plane.
If a minor under the age of two is travelling on the route, the “child icon” will appear on a specific seat reserved by the parents or guardians.
Thus, the person using the services of the carrier has the opportunity to choose a seat away from that occupied by the child.
The BBC reports that the airlines have already the imperfection of this solution.
The “Child’s icon” will not appear if the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the airplane has been changed at the last minute.
As you could expect, the idea divided the internet.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved with noise-reducing headphones.
They are children, they were once.
“We need to learn to be tolerant because we will soon need maps of seated places for mouth-breathing, salivation, or drinkers,” G Sundar wrote.
Another internet user noticed that he was once bothered by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of Japan Airlines.
“Thank you for warning me of screaming children during the 13-hour journey,” Rahat Ahmed wrote.
The bankruptcy of Thomas Cook’s travel agency
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be able to travel to Mallorca in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced on Monday by travel agency Thomas Cook.
As spokesman for the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands, Marc Pons, said on Friday, among the 25,000 tourists who will not be able to take advantage of the October vacation in Mallorca, there are also people who were supposed to travel with companies indirectly related to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80 percent of the expected vacationers who had to give up their holiday on Mallorca next month due to a British company’s bankruptcy were citizens of Germany and Scandinavia.
However, according to Pons, because Thomas Cook did not drive tourists to the Balearic island in November-April, the losses for the local economy will be less.
He revealed that the Balearic government has already begun negotiations with international operators on “entering the market of Mallorca” after the bankruptcy of the British operator.
The newspaper Diario de Mallorca estimates that more than 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourist crisis in Mallorca.
About 800 employees at the Thomas Cook office in Palm Beach have been fired.
The rest of the workers will lose their jobs mainly in the hotel industry.
On Monday, with the announcement of Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy in several hotels in Mallorca, property owners demanded guests to pay an additional accommodation fee.
Dozens of tourists from Poland were involved.
The Balearic government estimates that by Thursday, dozens of hotels in Mallorca had stopped operating at least until the end of October due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its partners.
According to the newspaper Diario de Ibiza, the majority of hotels in Ibiza that have partnered with the Thomas Cook Group are not planning to shut down in the coming weeks.
The newspaper reminds that on this Balearic island the British bankrupt co-operated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous authorities of the Balearic Islands announced that they would ask the Spanish government for support of the region in the amount of €100 million to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the most affected tourists in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, are located in Mallorca.
According to data from the Balearic government, Thomas Cook owes local travel companies, mainly hotel operators, about €5 million for the execution of contracts for the July-September 2019 period.
FIFA Women’s ranking.
Poland remains 29th, the United States at the forefront
The women’s national team is ranked 29th in the International Football Federation (FIFA) ranking published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Milos Stępiński was classified in the previous, July draw.
Weak team matches.
How is it in October?
The leaders remained the Americans who recently defended the world championship title.
The second place was held by the Germans and the third was held by the Dutch.
The teams are preparing for qualification.
They were scheduled to start the match with the Czechs on September 3.
The meeting was postponed for a year due to food poisoning.
In this situation, the Poles will open the qualification with a meeting with the Spanish on 12 November in Lublin.
Earlier, the “White-Red” will play two friendly matches – on October 3 with Cyprus, and five days later in Kielce with Brazil.
In the group of Poles rivals are the representatives of Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
The group winners and the top three teams from the second place will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six teams from the second place will play in barracks for the last three passes to the European Championship.
The wager of 16 participants will be supplemented by the host – England.
Poland’s men’s national team in the September FIFA ranking fell from 20th to 22nd place.
“Rz”: Smog crushed the government
“The effects of the Clean Air program are tiny, and the coal furnaces will crack this winter as if nothing,” we read on the front page of today’s “Rzeczpospolita”.
So far, within the framework of the Clean Air programme, 82,000 applications for funding of a total value of PLN 2 billion have been submitted, of which 48,000 decisions have been positive.
The approved proposals amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million”, reports “Rz”, citing data from the spokesman of the Minister of Environment.
As stated in the report, only part of the costs are reimbursed.
The results of the announced bullying program the newspaper judges as “modest”.
Local government officials, quoted by “Rz”, see the failures of “Clean Air” among others in too much bureaucracy.
“The program should be much simpler: electronic application, sending invoices by mail, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve the operations,” says Jacek Wiśniowski, mayor of Lidzbark Warmiński.
Activists from Polish Smog Alarm note that in the first year of operation, less than 1% of the target of replacing 3 million boilers was achieved.
As "Rz" notes, although the program's budget is 103 billion PLN for 10 years, or 10 billion PLN annually, this amount is virtual.
“In the budget of the National Fund for Environmental Protection and Water Management for this year has been reserved a raft of PLN 1.4 billion,” we read.
Congress approves F-35 for Poland
Negotiating prices now
The U.S. Congress has approved the sale of 32 F-35s to Poland.
“This is one of the last steps before the conclusion of the contract, but not the end of our work,” Błaszczak wrote on Twitter.
“We will negotiate hard to the most favorable price possible,” the Polish minister added.
Polish F-35
Polish Air Force is targeting 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters manufactured by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the U.S. State Department approved their sale to Poland.
The investment will support the national security and foreign policy of the United States by improving the security of the NATO ally, which is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland has to pay $6.5 billion for the aircraft.
However, this is not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also cover the supply of spare and repair parts, training equipment, performance of engineering, logistics and human resources services and related logistics and program support elements and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35
The F-35 Lightning II, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is a single-seat and single-engine multi-task fighter of the fifth generation.
The aircraft is capable of carrying out close-support missions, bombing and typically fighter air combat tasks.
Thanks to the use of stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable for near-range radars.
Recently, the F-35 was purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the ageing F-16.
Other U.S. allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering the purchase of U.S. fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Gender dolls
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
This is how we fight stereotypes.
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls
In addition to Barbie with different skin colors, figures and hairstyles, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls for sale.
Toys from the “Creatable World” series wear wigs.
Children can choose whether their Barbie should have long or short hair.
Their wardrobe consists of both pants and dresses.
In an instant, dolls can turn from girls to boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colors and with different clothes.
It was also discontinued to emphasize the characteristic gender traits – gender dolls no longer have full lips, long eyelids and thin waist, or – in the case of Ken – wide arms.
The company believes that children don’t like when their dolls have gender norms imposed, and some parents and feminists are convinced that toys made with a specific gender in mind inhibit girls’ ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
“The new dolls will make all children feel free,” Mattel said.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high heels, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting “unhealthy female stereotypes,” such as unnatural body proportions.
The group has responded to the criticism and has already introduced dolls with different skin colors, as well as more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: Circle or Club Together may have dozens of members
Zandberg asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party can get into the Seimas from the lists of leftist parties (KW SLD whose letter starts the candidates to the Seimas SLD, Spring and Left Together, starting with the common logo “Lewica”), replied that it depends on the outcome of the committee.
“I believe that the result of the Left will be very good, because we feel that people associate hope with the fact that the Left is not only right, but also has strength,” he said.
According to Zandberg, it follows that the left could have 60 to 80 deputies.
“It could mean that a circle or a club Together will have a dozen members.
It depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I’m not going to guess and say how it will happen,” he said.
Asked if the Left Together would have a separate circle, Zandberg replied: “We are committed to being different, and we will not pretend that this diversity does not exist.
I think that this diversity was rewarded by the Poles, because we showed that by being different, we were able to agree on a common program.”
Asked whether the biggest beneficiary of the joint start is the leader of the SLD Vladimir Czarzasta, Zandberg replied that he believes that the biggest beneficiaries are the center-left and left-wing voters.
In turn, noting that it is the SLD that will receive the entire subsidy, he replied that “the goal of a political party is to represent its voters.”
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the Seimas elections.
During the election he said he was thinking.
“The offer is diverse and in this offer there are candidates and candidates to whom my heart is closer, but there are also those to whom my heart is further,” he said.
“I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in the 44th Senate district, I would take my ballot certificate and vote in another district,” he said.
“I probably’t be tempted to vote for Minister Kazimierz Ujazdowski,” he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski start the leader of Citizens of Poland Pavel Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a massive mosque, considered to be the largest in West Africa.
Muslims arrived by buses, cars and walking to the Bopp neighborhood, where a new mosque could accommodate 30,000 believers stood.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, which belongs to the Sufi Islamic stream that dominates Senegal.
The work on the mosque began ten years ago on a six-hectare wetland granted by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan Mosque ("Roads to Paradise") comes from the title of the poem of Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th century founder of the Brotherhood, worshipped by believers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with marble and has five minarets.
The highest is 78 meters.
The mosque can accommodate 15,000 believers inside, while the second can accommodate 15,000 on the outer esplanade.
In the richly decorated interiors, you can admire the golden dome, giant lanterns and decorations hand-made by workers from Morocco.
The builders claim that the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the mosque is not comparable to mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II Mosque in Casablanca can accommodate 105,000 believers.
The construction of the mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to land, the government funded lighting, sanitary equipment and road works worth 10.5 million euros.
Trainer Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
A pass of eight league matches without a win the Crown players will try to interrupt in Friday's meeting with the vice-leader of the extreme class Śląskiem.
“Our problem is not Wrocław, but we ourselves, we have to work on what we play,” said coach Mirosław Smyla.
The Crown players last and so far the only victory in the league recorded in the first round, when at the departure they defeated 1:0 Benjamina games Raków Częstochowa.
Later, the kielczanie recorded two remises and six losses, and on Tuesday they lost 0:1 to Zagłębie Lubin in the 1/32 final of the Polish Cup.
“I am optimistic that in the last seconds of the cup game, the players were fighting for a goal, they wanted to finish.
Their fall on the fence after the last whisper was not due to the collapse, it was just a fall of anger because they were so close,” Smyla said.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, so it will sensitize the team to play in the side sectors of the pitch.
“We are aware of the quality of the opponent, but we are also looking at what we want to play,” added the coach.
On Friday's match in Korona, Ognjen Gnjatic will not play a pause for the excess of yellow cards, in the frame will also miss the injured Jakub Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski.
It is interesting to see a few players in the game with the desire to play.
“We have a headache, recently it seemed to be gone, and now it is,” Smyla said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the pass of eight league matches in a row without winning, while in the extra class anyone can win against anyone.
“We are a good team.
We may not have shown this on the pitch in recent weeks, but the moment will come when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday,” he said.
After nine rounds, the Crown with five points occupies the 15th position.
He scored 12 more and is in second place.
Friday’s match will start at 20:30.
These trees could disappear from Europe
“42 percent of the tree species in Europe are endangered,” the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) warned in the Red Book of European Trees published on Friday.
At the top of the list are chestnut and jarzobina.
IUCN, an organization based in Gland, Switzerland, has published a list of endangered European tree species for the first time.
It was compiled by experts who, on the basis of research, concluded that of the 454 species of trees found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world) 42% are “highly endangered”.
Among the causes, the Red Book lists the rapid expansion of urban agglomerations and global climate change.
However, the most threatened are those trees and bushes that occur solely or mainly on our continent.
According to IUCN experts, 58 percent of species are endangered and 15 percent, or 66 species of trees and bushes, are at risk of extinction.
Among the main causes of deforestation, the Red Book lists errors in the use of timber, accelerated urbanization, excessive cutting of trees, followed by forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
According to the authors of the report, the existence of many European varieties of bushes, mosses and rivers is also seriously threatened.
“Human activity is leading to the gradual extinction of European plant species and poses the danger of extinction in Europe of important and underestimated varieties that form the foundation of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet,” concluded Luc Bas, head of the European Office of IUCN.
Mr. Schetyna: I don’t promise 600+
“Today PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a loan for freedom, which future generations will have to pay back,” Grzegorz Schetyna said in an interview with Rzeczpospolita.
According to him, “All politics is shit.”
At the same time, the politician promises that “what is data will not be taken away.”
Schetyna assures in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It is about the mobilization of the electorate at the polling stations.
According to him, the opposition has greater potential in this regard than the Kaczynski party.
“Today there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are supporters of PiS, a party that has defrauded from the declared values of humility, humility, transparency,” Schetyna said.
The leader of the Citizen Coalition and the chairman of the Citizen Platform also highlighted the basic principles of the electoral program.
“First, nothing will be taken, but it is necessary to set the direction for the future, because PiS deals only with the situation here and now, there is no plan for Poland, which can be seen even after dramatically low investments,” he said.
Second, it is about “activating the energy of the Poles, helping and investing in those who work honestly – and those who are entrepreneurial.”
Schetyna explains that the KO program included, among other things, a project that will give the least-earned Poles more of PLN 614 per hand, and the more-earned – also a few hundred.
The politician also stated that he did not want to compete for the distribution.
As he said, he will do as much as he can, but he won’t promise 600+.
“I will never allow the Greek variant, where the rulers were bidding with the opposition for the distribution, until the country’s financial collapse finally occurred,” he said.
Schetyna in an interview with "Rz" also stated that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Margarita Kidawa-Blońska.
“We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda,” he said.
Pride precedes fall.
Kaczynski is such a man of state as Banas is crystal,” he added.
The leader also said that he has not yet decided whether he will be applying for the chair of the platform.
Argentina: Six dead condors
Six large condors have been found dead in the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, reports TVN24.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
Large condors were probably poisoned with a drug to kill predators such as pumps, foxes, or wild dogs.
Animals may have eaten toxic waste.
In addition to one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
“This is a huge loss for the environment, as the condor must be 10 to 15 years old to become fertile and able to reproduce.
So we are losing a protected species, an endangered species,” said Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
“I think the use of toxic attraction and poison puts not only this species at risk, but all other forms of life, including human health,” he adds.
“Rz”: They want a jewel for the president
The work on awarding the head of the state of the value chain has begun.
The idea was supported by the office of Andrzej Dudy – we read in “Rzeczpospolitej”.
As the newspaper explains, it is the golden chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called in the interwar period the jewel of the Republic of Poland.
This was the last time President Ignacy Mościcki used it.
“Rz” reports that such a chain may soon hit the shoulders of Andrzej Duda.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, Rule of Law and Petitions voted on Wednesday on a proposal to begin work on amendments to the law on orders and honors to restore it.
The newspaper writes that this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was rejected by one vote.
This time the work is quick.
At the beginning of August, the senators devoted a few minutes to the matter, acknowledging that they would consult the President’s Office.
It came in mid-September.
“I kindly inform you that the Office of the President of Poland does not comment on the position presented in this petition,” wrote the President’s Minister Andrzej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee continued the matter and once again devoted little time to the matter.
“The office of the President answered us briefly: it is in favor of restoring it,” said the head of the committee Robert Mamutov of PiS, quoted by “Rz”.
He submitted a proposal for legislative work, which the Commission endorsed.
Police will teach drivers how to drive through crossings
A police operation will be carried out, among other things, at the intersection of al. Ciepliński with al. Piłsudski.
The actions of the uniforms are somewhat related to recent complaints by the city authorities about drivers who are not always able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, September 27, the police in Rzeszów start the preventive action “Crossroads”.
It is about eliminating obstacles in traffic: entering a crossroads without the possibility of descending, failure to observe light signs or road signs.
“We often think that we are alone at a crossroads, and we actually make life difficult for other drivers,” said Marek Ustrobiński, vice president of the city a few days ago.
His words were heard at the press conference of the town hall, at which the city authorities presented examples of inappropriate movements of cars along intersections, which as a result creates traffic jams.
At the time, the president appealed to travelers to be prudent on the road and, among other things, to move faster on the lights or not to write SMS while driving.
The issue has been taken over by the Rzeszow police officers, who are starting the “Cruising Crossing” operation today.
What is it?
The aim of the action is to eliminate the phenomenon of restricting traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing driving.
This is a frequent violation that contributes to increasing obstacles in movement and the formation of congestion.
He is threatened with a penalty of 300 PLN and two penalty points.
In addition, uniforms will pay attention to non-compliance with light signals or road signs and incorrect parking in the area of intersections.
They will also observe a lack of smooth driving, late starts from the signals, slow crossing crossings and leaving too long distances between vehicles.
At what intersections will action be carried out?
Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellońska street; Cieplińskiego street from Piłsudski street; Targowej street from Piłsudski street; Śreniawitów square from Dąbrowski street or Hetmańskiej street from Warsaw Insurgents street.
This type of action in the capital of Podkarpatia will be held on the next Friday of October.
Inspected company disposing of waste from “Cajka”
“Employees of the Department of Environmental Protection of the Mayor’s Office of the Wołominsky County and the District Inspectorate of Construction Inspection inspected on Friday the facility in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste is disposed of from the wastewater treatment plant “Czajka” in Warsaw,” said Karol Szyszko, a spokesman for the mayor of Wołominsk.
Inspectors from the mayor of Volomyn conducted inspections in the plant located in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zielonka.
Private Commercial and Transportation Plant “Dar-Trans” under the contract with the capital wastewater treatment plant “Cajka” performs the services of waste management.
“Installation inspections were carried out, and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation related to his activities,” Szyszko said.
The report will be submitted to the Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in Dar-Trans was carried out by the Voivodeship Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw between December 29, 2015 and February 11, 2016.
It was then established that the company did not carry out sampling, measurements and tests of groundwater, and also did not have the results of tests of stabilized municipal wastewater deposits from the sewage treatment plant "Cajka".
After the inspection, Dariusz Sobota was asked to stop violating the conditions of the decision.
Dariusz Sobota’s private trade and transport facility “DAR-TRANS” is one of the companies receiving waste in the form of stabilized municipal wastewater deposits from the treatment plant “Czajka”.
According to the decision to conduct waste disposal at the site, up to 60,000 tons of waste is processed in the forests near Zielonka per year.
Warsaw City Enterprise of Water and Sewage informed on Thursday that at the turn of November and December 2018 STUOŚ was disabled, which was related to damage to one of the combustion plants.
The monthly cost of their export is PLN 1.7 million (calculated on the basis of export costs from 01.01.2019 to 31.08.2019).
Lech Wałęsa supported Margareta Kidawa-Blonskaya.
“You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support,” Lech Walesa told Margareta Kidawa-Blonsk on Friday.
“Mr. President, for me these are very important words,” replied the candidate of the Citizen Coalition for prime minister, the leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that when it comes to the situation in Poland, it is now "only a retired fan."
Margaret Kidawa-Blonskaya met with former President Lech Wałęsa in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk on Friday.
In the brief conversation behind closed doors also took part the son of Wałęsa – Jarosław.
“You have taken on a difficult task,” Lech Walesa said after the meeting.
“You can count on my full support,” he added.
“The problems facing Poland are known to all of us.
Therefore, there is a great hope that you as a woman will cope with these problems, and we all – those who love Poland – will support your actions as much as possible,” the former president said, addressing Kidawa-Blońska.
Very important words
Kidawa-Blonska thanked for the support.
“Mr. President, these are very important words for me, because no one like you can talk about freedom, about the Constitution and knows how important it is,” she said.
“Let’s show that we can make a different, wise policy, together, but in accordance with the constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you did your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland,” Kidawa-Błońska said.
Kibic Retirement
Wałęsa told reporters that he is now “only a retired fan.”
“Of course I’m watching it.
I hope that we will reverse the course of events, that what was good, tested, (to that) we will return.
The triple division of power is the most important, the constitution is the most important, the courts are indispensable.
And all this needs to be cleaned up, all this needs to be restored to normal operation and I believe that this time we will do it.
Because if not, then we are waiting for a street criterion,” Lech Walesa said.
This is why it is so important that the Poles go to elections, think and make their own decisions.
And that’s the most important thing,” Kidawa-Blonská said.
“This is the last chance that we can improve the situation in Poland,” the former president said.
“We need to build a new foundation.”
Asked about the most important changes that should take place in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: “The president said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no tripartite power, since the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and let everyone know that otherwise Poland will not move a step forward.”
Slovenia – Poland 3:1 in the semi-finals.
On the hot terrain in Lublan, the Polish netizens met the Slovens in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussion with the judges, with Polish coach Vital Heynen in the lead role.
The Red-White team lost 1:3 and will play for a bronze medal.
Senate approves key laws
The Senate passed without amendments the law on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials and on the flights of the most important persons in the state.
52 senators voted in favour of the amendment to the Law on the Property of Families of State Officials – without amendments – 14 voted against, three abstained.
Thus, the senators decided to reject 12 amendments, submitted during Wednesday's debate by Senator PO Sławomir Rybickie.
According to him, the amendments were intended to “civilize” the law and limit the scope of the information given in the declaration on the property situation of their own children, children of a spouse, adopted children to cases where children remain in the common household with the person obliged to make the declaration.
The bill on the disclosure of the property of the families of the most important state officials, which was drafted in the Prime Minister’s office, was passed by the Sejm on September 11.
The provisions stipulate that, among others, Prime Minister, Ministers, MPs, MPs, Senators, Presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as persons leading other state institutions will be required to include in the asset statement information about the personal property of spouses, children and persons living together.
The Senate has also not proposed amendments to the law on the flights of the most important persons in the state.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can be on board government aircraft along with the most important people in the state.
The law also specifies who is responsible for managing the Central Flight Register.
For the bill, without amendments, 55 senators voted, 12 voted against, four abstained.
According to the law, every flight of the president will be a flight "executed in an official mission".
The president’s flights will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the president.
On the other hand, the flight of the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Marshals of the Seimas and the Senate will only be carried out "in order to carry out tasks directly related to their duties".
The law also clarifies the list of people who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
According to the regulations, members of the delegation – invited MPs, senators, representatives of public authorities and experts; persons providing technical, medical or organizational support; as well as journalists – may be on board.
According to the law, in case of doubts related to the flights of the Marshals of the Seimas and the Senate, the head of the KPRM will ask for their explanation.
If such doubts are not clarified within the specified time, the head of the KPRM will be obliged to notify the heads of the office of the Sejm or the Senate of the inability to organize such a flight.
New Sports Commissioner
Waldemar Paluch has appointed his Commissioner for Physical Culture, Sport and Tourism.
He became Artur Świątek, long-time chairman of the University Club AZS PWSTE Jarosław, for the last 4 years director of the Office of the Rector of the University of Yaroslavl.
Bartłomiej Pacek Artur Świątek recently was heavily involved in the project of reactivating basketball in Yaroslavl.
Artur Świątek is not an anonymous figure in the Yaroslavl sports environment.
Graduated from the Academy of Physical Education in Biela Podlaska since 2002, he has been an instructor at the State Higher Technical and Economic School in Yaroslavl and has served as president for 15 years.
The Poles after the first training in Paris, waiting for the last rival
Polish footballers held their first training in Paris on Friday, where they will play a match for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heynen's way to the title was closed by a loss against Slovenia 1:3 in Ljubljana on Thursday.
There was noise about their trouble traveling to this duel.
This time it went without such problems – on Friday morning they went with the Slovens by charter to Paris, and a few hours later they had a training in the famous Bercy hall.
According to the reports of the people present at the classes, the coach of the world champions was nervous.
As Heynen’s assistant Mikhail Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not the exercise of networking elements.
“We went to the hall, but most of the time it was time for the team.
It was more about spending time together than training.
Talk, think about how to rebuild it all as a team,” he said.
He confirmed that the semi-final defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the training staff.
“We were brutally brought to earth.
Without a doubt, we are disappointed.
We always thought we would go back to this game.
We talked about this game with each other in the staff, the coach talked a lot with the players.
As two main causes of defeat I would point out inefficiency in attack and much worse than usual dealing with situation balls.
In this regard, the Slovenians were much better than us,” he said.
According to him, “White-Red” was not hindered by the stress associated with the performance against the hosts of the tournament supported by a loud and large audience.
He admitted that the world champions could have slept a smooth path to the semi-finals.
“Maybe if we had a similar defeat in the group stage, we would have analyzed the lesson sooner and later played differently in the next stage of the tournament.
“It’s just a whistle,” he warned.
Gogol hopes that the anger associated with the Polish defeat on Thursday will turn into aggression in the bronze match.
I hope we can show our true face.
There is something to fight.
The last time I won the medal was in 2011,” he said.
Paris is the fifth city and France the third country visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group phase they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two meetings of the group phase they went to Apeldoorn, and in the semi-final they moved to Ljubljana.
Nick Kyrgios: Strong punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player has received a 16-week ban and a $25,000 fine – in a six-year suspension – for blatant words, gestures and actions during the recent ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour activists are losing patience for Kyrgios, but still give him a chance to improve.
The summary of the crimes of the most indefinite professional tennis player of recent years looks dangerous – 16 weeks of break plus a substantial fine, but nevertheless both penalties are suspended for half a year – a trial period during which the hard-hearted athlete will be able to improve.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he has been breaking a long time and has set a world record in tennis – he had to pay the highest single financial penalty in the history of the discipline for breaking the rules of behavior on the court and next to him.
Loud curses, strange gestures, athletic behavior, insulting the referee and spectators, breaking two rockets during a losing match with Karen Chatshanov – for all this after the August ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati he paid $113 thousand.
At the US Open 2019 he also didn’t play for a long time, but he managed to publicly say that ATP activists were “corrupted”, which hurt the organization’s authorities so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks issued the aforementioned verdict on the suspension of the starts and another fine.
He was forgiven after hearing the accused and knowing the context of the statement.
Tennis activists stated, however, that the investigation revealed that Kyrgios’ behavior over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted a continuous violation of the rules, that he continuously insulted in a vulgar way tournament-related persons and spectators, hence a high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the execution of the verdict, ordering several conditions to be met within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the rules of the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular, can no longer curse, destroy the rocket, quarrel with the judges and the audience, or any other way behave dishonestly and vulgar.
He was also advised to seek “continuous support” from mental coaches during tournaments and also outside of the season to consult with people who specialize in solving problems of athletes who fail to cope with proper behavior.
Nick Kyrgios’ first comment (in social media) on the verdict was: “Hey everyone, I can still play.
I just have to control my behavior, that’s all.”
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, because in the Lavera Cup his shoulder injury worsened, so he had to give up the upcoming starts in Beijing (30 September – 6 October) and Shanghai (6–13 October).
In the ATP ranking Kyrgios is ranked 27th.
This year, he won two tournaments – in Washington and Acapulco, earned more than $1.3 million, so even after fines he will have a lot of money.
Poland: Life is getting better
According to a report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday, 44% of households assessed their material situation as good or rather good in the last year.
A year earlier, the percentage was 37.2%, in 2016 33.5%, and since 2009, when the Statistical Office first examined subjective assessments of households, it has never exceeded 30%.
A total of 8.1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11.2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best situation is for self-employed households.
More than 70% of respondents consider it good or good.
On the second pole are the households of the Ranceists, where the percentage of such responses was only 18 percent.
The number of children also has a significant influence on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is for single parents raising offspring, of whom a good or rather good material situation declares 32 percent.
Among couples with children, this percentage ranges from 55% to 60% (depending on the number of children), while among households without children it is 48.8%.
These statistics clearly show the effect of the 500+ program.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst assessment of their financial situation was made by single parents raising offspring and multi-child families (with at least three children).
The improvement of subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles is a reflection of the rapid growth of incomes, primarily from work.
However, this is not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good is growing faster than their real income.
Furthermore, there is no clear relationship between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best ratings are formulated by the inhabitants of the Opole Voivodeship, where their situation is considered good or rather good by 48,9% of respondents.
The following are the Lubuska Voivodeship (47.7 per cent), the Silesian Voivodeship (47.6 per cent), the Mazowiecki Voivodeship (47.3 per cent) and the West Pomeranian Voivodeship (47.1 per cent).
Meanwhile, the disposable income (i.e. after payment of taxes and contributions) was less than 94 per cent of the national average in the last year, and 98 per cent in Lubusk.
The highest incomes were in Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesian (104 percent).
On average, the disposable income per person in Poland was 1693 PLN in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4.3% compared to 2017.
Compared to previous years, the result is relatively low.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7 percent, and a year later by 6.3 percent.
While income growth slows down, it also slows down spending growth.
These per person amounted to PLN 1187 in the past year, which means that in real terms they decreased by 0.7%.
This is the first such case since 2013.
In 2017, per capita spending increased by 1.9% and in 2016 by 4.3%.
Studies of household budgets suggest that statistical households now spend 70.1 per cent of their disposable income, compared to more than 80 per cent in 2014 and more than 90 per cent in 2006.

Three U.S. Aircraft Carrier Crew Suicides
Three sailors committed suicide on board the USS George H. W. Bush last week, the U.S. Navy said.
Over the past two years, five crew members have been killed.
The previous suicide occurred in July of this year, and the previous in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of these events occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush landed off the coast of Virginia.
Third parties have so far been excluded from the case.
In addition, deaths are not related.
“Everyone needs to be involved in making suggestions and ideas about how we can prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help,” Captain Sean Bailey, the ship’s commander, wrote on Facebook.
Criticism of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing.
In a conversation with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski emphasized that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
“Each of his opinions was accepted.”
There was criticism of some of his actions.
For me, the fact that John Paul II was unable to eliminate the harmful activity of Rydzik is placing a great shadow on his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist – the perpetrator of the Church and Poland – developed his media to the best even during the life of the Pope Polak,” he explained.
The former PO politician admitted: “There were flashes of dissatisfaction, the pope said something, once he did not accept Rydzik, but he had power and for politicization he could simply throw him out of the Church or send him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to collect money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not do this, as did his successors,” Nieselowski explained.
In addition, there has been this fatal case of pedophilia and the Church’s activities, and indeed their absence.
I thought a little ahead, but I wanted to pay attention to the whole of his life.
The scale of pedophilia in the Church has been known for quite a while.
The question arises, how is it possible that John Paul II, being the head of the Church, did not know about these disgusting things,” he said in an interview with the journalist.
According to the former politician PO, the Polish Church is an ally of PiS.
“We must admit that in the period of Solidarity, the Church was our most important ally.
All celebrations began with Mass, crosses were hanged everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they have become a symbol of dictatorship – a sign of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about this and that today the Church is an ally of PiS.
It is a black chapter of the Polish Church, for which it will come to pay salt,” Nesiołowski said.
“I hope that Pope Francis will persecute Jadraszewski, Rydzyk and a few others of this kind,” he said.
590th Anniversary Celebration Tomorrow
There will be concerts and auctions.
The event will be held at the Hrubieszowski House of Culture.
At 10 a.m. in the Church of St. Nicholas the Mass begins.
The official opening ceremony will take place at 11:30 in HDK.
The Song and Dance of the Land of Hrubieszowski.
Stanisława Staszica will present the spectacle entitled “Powiat Hrubieszowski: Stąd rod mój – tu żyję”.
They will be awarded the Medal of Merit for the Hruščovsky district.
At 16 a.m., the event will be transferred to the town hall, where the concerts “Hrubieszów charitable for Angelika Zińkiewicz” will take place.
There will be disco polo bands – NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and evening star Mig.
There will be auctions, including pencil and porcelain of the President of the Council of Ministers.
The PZPN is punishing for burds in the stadiums.
Grif Disqualified
The match in the framework of the Polish Cup between Griph Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk for a little hair did not end tragically, when the shot off by the fans of Wejherowa raca by millimeters passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatana Alomerovicia.
After the incident, the match was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN commission investigating the case imposed a harsh penalty on Griff, excluding him from future competitions.
The club will not be able to compete in the 2020/2021 Polish Cup.
In addition, fans will not be allowed to enter their own stadium in the next match.
They will not be able to participate in the league matches until December 31.
Burdens at the Widzewa Łódź stadium were also provoked by Silesia Wrocław fans.
Here, however, the PZPN judgment was milder, because Silesia warned that similar events could occur and sensitized the relevant authorities on this issue.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the boat fans sector to be thrown with rabbits, chairs to be burned and the hosts sector to be forced.
The game was interrupted for eight minutes and the police were forced to use a water gun.
PZPN punished Silesia with a one-time ban on the stadium in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of PP.
The ban also covers league matches, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
GDDKiA plans to exchange marking on the entire managed road network by the end of 2020.
GDDKiA Rzeszów
In Podkarpatsk, the implementation of the amendment of the Regulation of the Ministry of Infrastructure on, among other things, recording the names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish began.
For example, “Lion” will appear next to “L’viv”.
In our province, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and domestic roads: DK19, DK94.
As we hear, it should be easier, clearer and simpler.
Regulation of the Minister of Infrastructure on specific technical conditions for road signs and traffic safety devices.
“We should remember that the names of towns in neighboring countries often have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the changes we have prepared in the law, they will finally appear on road signs along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking starts from the Podkarpatsk section of the A4 motorway,” said Infrastructure Minister Andrzej Adamczyk.
In Podkarpatsk, the changes will be introduced on 94 road signs set at the A4 motorway and domestic roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of investment?
200 thousand pounds.
First, the new marking will be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is scheduled for 1 November 2019.
How does the idea look like?
It will be done without exchanging tables, on the basis of stickers.
They will replace the existing names of the towns with new names written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line – first in Polish, then in the original, in a slide.
This will be a great facility for those who do not know the spelling of foreign town names in the language of the country in which they are located.

Someone shot a man from the windshield.
In a pond in Zamecznie in the Lower Silesia, residents noticed a labyrinth having problems with wings.
After catching and visiting the veterinarian, it was discovered that someone had targeted the animal – in his body was found a straw from a windmill.
“The information about the wounded bird was received from the villagers of the Wildlife Rehabilitation Center in Nowej Soli.
It was that the animal had broken wings.
We went to place.
It was immediately apparent that something was wrong with him.
We acted quickly and accurately so as not to hurt him or expose him to additional stress.
The dog was caught and taken to the veterinarian.
After the first RTG photo, it was already known that someone had made a shooting shield from him.
There were fragments of scrape in his body,” says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, which manages the rehabilitation center.
Staying in the Center
“The wounds have been cleansed, the bird has been given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the resort where it will spend the whole winter.
We try to strengthen it.
He is not yet able to fly.
Releasing him now would be associated with the fact that he probably’t survive the winter,” Walasek added.
The staff, after submitting the labyrinth to rehabilitation, intends to release it to the same pond in the spring.
After receiving information about the cause of the animal's ill health, the authorities of the Zhukovice municipality intend to inform the prosecutor's office of the case.

Gowin: “We need to stimulate Polish, small trade”
“Effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, it will be necessary to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” said Jarosław Gowin, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, and leader of the Agreement.
Gowin, during a conversation in the "Signals of the Day" on the radio station Jedynka, stated that trade is dominated by international networks, which impose Polish producers so low margins that Polish companies can not actually grow.
Noting that this problem is very difficult to fight, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government tried to deal with it at the very beginning of the term, but received “contra from the Commission”.
“We won the court of justice and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will return to this topic,” he said.
He noted at the same time that “effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of Polish, i.e. small trade.”
“On top of that, it will be necessary to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade,” Gowin said.
In May, the European Court of Justice ruled that the European Commission had made a mistake in determining that the Polish retail tax was an unauthorized state aid.
The Retail Sales Tax Act envisaged the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0.8% on revenue between 17 million PLN and 170 million PLN per month and 1.4% on revenue above 170 million PLN per month.
The tax had been in effect since September 2016.
In September 2016, the European Commission opened an infringement proceedings against Poland.
Brussels then argued that the tax design could favor smaller stores, which could be regarded as public aid.
It was then stated that the tax was implemented unlawfully.
It also ordered the suspension of the tax until its analysis by officials in Brussels has been completed.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the collection of taxes was suspended.
The EU court’s decision in May paved the way for the reintroduction of the tax, but did not end the case.
On 24 July, the Commission appealed to the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the press service of the Court of Justice of the European Union said that the case is now in the written phase, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government are presenting their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known if and when the oral proceedings will begin, i.e. the hearing of the parties and the possible hearing.
It takes a few to a dozen months from the appeal to the announcement of the judgment.
“Such proceedings take an average of a year,” a source at the court in Luxembourg told PAP.
How to dress a child for baptism?
We offer some practical solutions.
Baptism is a very important celebration in the life of the baby and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around the child, celebrating together his appearance in the world.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the newly baked mom and dad want their comfort to look as good as possible on this day.
However, before you make the final decision about your child’s clothing, consider whether it will also be comfortable.
In the shops, you can find a lot of clothing sets that do not provide the little one with adequate comfort.
What should we pay attention to?
The main criterion for choosing clothes is the age of the child.
Until recently, several-week-old babies were baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same beets or large pillows.
Today, children who attend the sacrament are often older: several months old, one year old, and even older.
It is not hard to guess that such a great consolation needs a slightly different dress for baptism.
Therefore, if your child is 3 to 4 months old on the day of baptism, he will probably spend the celebration in a wheelchair or on the hands of his parents or baptists.
The best solution will therefore be to decorate it in comfortable, cotton beds or sets.
Although this item of the wardrobe is considered to be everyday clothes, it is enough to look for its festive variants, for example, with a falbank or a plywood.
For the boy will be ideal body with printed musks and shells.
For older children, you can afford more imagination in clothes.
The girl will look beautiful in a straight, tiled dress
Many parents of girls look with longing toward richly decorated, woolish dresses for baptism in a set of coats, straps and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials for their products, in which the child is simply uncomfortable.
In search of the right clothes, it is better to look at the Asanti for Kids store, which offers elegant costumes on cotton blankets.
Delicate, tiled sweaters, satin dresses, curls, apps and lovely sets will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect dress for a little gentleman: cotton garment
Until recently, among the parents of boys prevailed fashion for costumes being a copy of “adult” models.
Polyester shirts and pants, stiff collars or helmets often caused young elegants to voice their dissatisfaction.
Fortunately, today they have been cut off by comfortable, cotton sets.
Just look at the kits available in Asanti for Kids, i.e. soft, dressed trousers, and for this, a blush decorated in the front of the shirt.
These clothes look extremely festive, and at the same time do not disturb the movements of the little boy who knows the world.
Kristina Pawłowicz publishes property declaration
Kristina Pawłowicz has filed a declaration of assets at the end of her term.
According to him, he has collected $110,000 in savings.
Pavlovich has announced his withdrawal from politics.
At the end of his term, he has a total of $110,000.
As stated in the statement, she receives a monthly pension of PLN 4,7 thousand.
Pavlovich owns an apartment worth 570 thousand PLN and a slightly smaller one, which he rents, charging 880 PLN per month.
The MEP also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150,000.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also issued a declaration of property.
Voting on the interruption during the Conference of the Conservative Party
British parliamentarians voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons for the Conservative Party’s annual program conference, as requested by the government.
289 voted for and 306 against.
Usually, the House of Commons does not deliberate during party conferences, so that deputies do not have to resign from participating in them or from parliamentary meetings.
However, the opposition parties agreed that in such a critical time as the last few weeks before the UK’s planned exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt the debate.
289 MPs voted in favour of the proposal, 306 opposed.
Two opposition parties have signed conventions.
Failure to agree to the break could be seen as political revenge by the opposition on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (the decision was found unlawful and unprecedented by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and for not apologizing for it after the judges ruled.
Following this decision, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, with the most important event of the day being Johnson’s speech and the subsequent tumultuous debate.
Johnson has accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
“It is time for Brexit.
It is necessary to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Brexit must come so that we can reach an agreement on citizens’ priorities, health care, cost of living.
Brexit must be done so that we can unite this country,” Johnson said.
The Conservative Party conference will begin in Manchester on Sunday and last until Wednesday, October 2.
The two main opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already met.
One of the excuses that Johnson offered to explain the long suspension of parliament were party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
“President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders,” foreign media.
The president’s spokesman strongly denied this report.
“This is simply not true,” Błaże Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
Israeli media, such as “Haaretz” and “Jerusalem Post”, citing “Jewish Insider”, write that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, stated that it was Israel that was responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
He said the rise in anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a reaction to the anti-Polish rhetoric of Israeli leaders.
He referred to the words of Israeli Foreign Minister Katz, who stated in February that “the Poles sucked anti-Semitism with mother’s milk.”
Andrzej Duda said he regrets that Israel has not apologized for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against Polish ambassador to Israel Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a man who shouted, “Polish, Polish.”
“The quote is not just inaccurate.
This is simply not true,” Błaże Spychalski wrote on Twitter.
He stressed that Duda “never said that Israel is responsible for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.”
According to the portal “they invented it.”
During the meeting, there was also a dispute between the Holocaust survivor, awarded the Commander Cross of the Order of Merit of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg was supposed to agree with President Duda’s words and say that it was the Jews in Israel “like Israel Kac” who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to sources, Boteach was supposed to interrupt Mosberg’s speech.
Who is he and what is his fault?
The stone house rented by the sutners led the journalist to discover negligence in Marian Banasia’s asset statements.
Another incident that shook the ruling camp.
TVN’s “Supervisor” journalists revealed that Marian Banaś, chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control, has not entered a 400-metre-high mansion in Podgórz in the last few years.
Moreover, his tenant had to run a sex business (and thus rent rooms for hours).
In turn, the building itself was allegedly secured for the repayment of the loan since 2016.
The irregularities were noted by Bertold Kittel in the program “Supervisor”.
The journalist revealed that Banasia's house was rented by people associated with the criminal world to use it as a place for "erotic meetings".
The clients were men who used the services of prostitutes.
He responded to the accusations in a blatant and blatant manner.
Interestingly, the stone house rented by the sutners led the journalist to discover negligence in Banasia’s asset statements.
The stone house itself was described in them unclearly, and the income from its rental was to be underestimated.
“The property of Marian Banasia and his wife could be worth between 6 and 8 million PLN.
In total, the spouses can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings [...]”, writes Money.pl.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the banasia house itself was already worth about 3 million zlotys.
The Central Anti-Corruption Office is currently conducting an audit of Marian Banasi’s asset statements for 2015–2019.
Banass announced that he would suspend his activity at NIK until the time of its completion. “I will speak to Ms. Marshal for free leave,” he assured.
The opposition is demanding explanations.
“We do not hear that the CBA has expanded its investigation or accelerated the investigation of Marian Banasi’s asset statements.
Therefore, we are forced to extradite state authorities and submit a notification about the possibility of committing a crime [...],” said MP Mariusz Witczak.
“If an ordinary Polish man had valued his property so dramatically low, he would already have 10 checks, tax clearance and criminal and fiscal proceedings,” he added.
He went high, he fell low.
Marian Banaś is the new chairman of the Supreme Chamber of Control.
He was appointed on 30 August 2019 for a six-year term.
His candidacy was submitted by Law and Justice and was approved by the votes of the party’s politicians.
Banass was previously associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005, and worked in this institution as an associate of Lech Kaczyński.
During the first PiS rule (2005-2008) Banas served as Chairman of the Customs Service and also as Deputy Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance.
Since 2015 he has again served as head of the Customs Service and since 2017 he has been the head of the National Treasury Administration.
For three months he served as Finance Minister in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki.
Cooler Master Launches Graphics Cards
Graphics cards can now weigh really a lot, and this naturally makes room for the category of products that it would be in vain to look for on the shelves a decade ago.
This is exactly the solution – the holder for the ELV8 RGB graphics card – presented by Cooler Master.
The new model of graphics card handle is not only a functional solution that allows you to maintain the graphics card more confidently without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The Cooler Master ELV8 RGB also has an additional function – decorative.
Police: Ignoring orders will be punished
According to the newspaper, disregarding the order of a certain conduct issued by a police officer is a new type of offence, threatened with a fine, imprisonment or restriction of liberty.
Trade unions want this change.
The proposal has been submitted to the Committee on Petitions.
“This is a serious case, since more than half a million cases of offences are brought to Polish courts every year,” he said.
“Rzeczpospolita” has determined that the petition that the Independent Trade Union of Police writes to MPs on the amendment of the Code of Offences has a chance to succeed.
The petitioners propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Criminal Procedure Code.
“Whoever does not obey the request or order of a public official, issued within the boundaries and on the basis of the provisions of the law, shall be punished with arrest, fine or restriction of liberty.”
“Paragraph 3 of this provision speaks of the same punishment for those who, by not fulfilling orders, prevent or hinder the performance of official duties,” the newspaper reports.
The sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told “Rzeczpospolita” that although he agrees with the main message of the proposed regulation, he fears that if implemented, it could be used in political matters of demonstrations.
“In situations of freedom demonstrations, this would be unfavorable and instead of softening the situation, it would even worsen it,” he added.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86 percent of citizens positively assessed police interventions in 2018 and that every month the services make 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Obama is worried about Europe
Jáchym Topol has writing in his blood.
Among his ancestors are editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important Czech postwar playwrights, now mentioned in a row with Václav Havel.
From the beginning, there was a curse of the talent that Jáchim was trying to use.
Eight years later, he returned with the “Sensitive Man.”
The heroes are Buras and Soňa along with two sons who, however, do not form a typical Czech family.
They are travelling actors, traveling around Europe.
He is a Shakespeare lover and a thief, she is a one-eyed translator who does not break up with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys did not make a sound from his birth, and for the second time he stopped in his infancy.
But the heroes are not the most important in this story.
They are all just a backdrop for observing a world where there is no longer room for artistic nodes.
It’s a world of a dull province, a society of old people, suspicious people, and loose youth.
“The sensitive man” sometimes turns into an absurd theater.
The narrative imitates didaskalia, and the conversations of the heroes create this world.
The scene is a Europe full of concerns about its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy
Although the British travel agency Thomas Cook has failed, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is operating.
The company has problems.
Brussels Airlines has announced that it will cancel 105 flights in October due to problems related to Thomas Cook’s bankruptcy.
Neckermann has also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but guests will be able to receive a refund.
A court in Ghent has also declared bankruptcy to three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
Currently, about 12,000 Belgians are travelling abroad on trips bought by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were expected to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company is now “fully operational” despite a bankruptcy announcement by the British parent company, which has caused concern among employees and customers.
The office then reassured that customers who bought trips in it would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the world’s oldest travel agency, has declared bankruptcy on Monday.
A direct cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that in addition to the £900 million rescue plan agreed in August, the company secure an additional £200 million as a security for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
However, the company’s problems have grown over the past few years, resulting in a debt of £1.6 billion.

Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for reviews
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion – such an extraordinary offer was prepared for the visitors by the German Görlitz.
This will help prevent the decline in the population of the city.
Görlitz is the easternmost city in Germany.
The beautiful pastel old town attracts 140,000 tourists annually.
According to The Guardian, the city is facing serious problems.
There are the lowest wages in Germany.
The city also faces a constant decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved to the west, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city’s population.
In 2013, it reached 54,000 people.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea to start offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted.
Two-thirds of them are inhabitants of large cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States and the United Kingdom were also interested in the program.
“When we applied, we thought the program was meant to persuade people to move to Görlitz,” said one of the project participants.
“Now we feel it doesn’t matter whether we stay here in four weeks or not,” he added.
The city has seven thousand vacant homes, and the unemployment rate is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to obtain feedback from program participants.
The information collected from interviews and questionnaires is meant to help revive smaller German cities.
“We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation was,” said Robert Knippschild, program manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents by offering them incentives in the form of accommodation.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a pay program that promised young professionals to live and work in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candelaria in Italy, or in the American Tulsa in Oklahoma.
