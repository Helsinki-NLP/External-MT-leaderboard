British WRIs are concerned about the appearance of labels'
There is some opposition amongst some MPs to the proposal that their entitlement should be changed to MWPs (Members of the BGB Parliament).
The dispute arose from plans to change the name of the assembly to the British Parliament of the White.
AMs across the political spectrum have been accused of being a silent trap.
One MP told the Labour Party that his groups were concerned that he was "rhythmically" with Twp and Pwp".
Note for readers from outside of Little Britain: twp means fool and pwp means fool in British.
The AM told Plaid Cymru that he was not satisfied with the group as a whole, and alternative recommendations have been made.
One person told the Conservative Party that their groups were concerned about the name change, but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and Muppet in English.
In this context the letter w in British is pronounced as well as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission which is currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes said: 'It is of course for the Members themselves to take the final decision on any rapporteurs under the name to be given to Assembly Members.'
The British High Commissioner was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals which received broad support for the assembly's designation as the British White Parliament.
As regards the title of the NAMs, the Commission's choice was Welsh Parliament Members (WMPs), but the MWP choice received the most support in a public consultation.
The AMs appear to be proposing alternatives, but the dilemma of coming to any opinion could be a concern for the Chief Executive Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to table a draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the dissolution of the Assembly and on the design of the committee system.
The final vote on what title they would be given when they debate the legislation will be taken by the HAMs.
We have a day of voting for the people of Macedonia in the referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country should change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was agreed as part of an attempt to end years of border resentment with Greece, which also has five countries named Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that its northern neighbours' name means a claim to its territories, and has staged successive protests against its EU and ECAT membership applications.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov, who is opposed to the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to pay for EU and ECAT membership.
Silence comes on St. Martin's Bell and a blast is coming on Chapel in Harlem
"Historically, the old men I spoke to say that there was a pub and a church around every corner", said Lord Adams.
"Neither of those exist today".
He said that the action was understood.
"People go out in different ways" today, he said.
"The bars are no longer the public seating areas that people go to on a regular basis".
As for the chapels, he worries that the money from asset sales will not last as long as leaders want, "and they will be right back where they started sooner or later".
The church could be replaced by a barracks, and the neighbourhood is full of the kind of people who don't help the wool of the woods.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people", he said, "and they will therefore accelerate the day when these churches are completely demolished because most of the people who move into these buildings are unlikely to be members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white-collar communities before Harlem became a blue-collar city - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The Modhach tribe moved out of the 1930s.
The building was given its title by a blue-collar community, who worshipped nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a blue-collar community under the Respect Act by John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the retailers of 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who were against hiring or promoting people with blue-collar status.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the parishioners commissioned Father Johnson to design the clock when they planned to rebuild.
The Clergyman's Clock was signed on the calendar by the Hon. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's.
The expert who performed the July programme called it something else: "cultural treasure" and "historical musical instrument whose counterpart could not be found".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that the world's first recording of a blue-collar musician, Dionisio A. Lind, was moved to the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Lord Merriweather said St. Martin's had not found a representative for him.
The complexity of the situation at St. Martin's over the past few months has been that some have been brought in by the church's tuatha leaders, while others have been brought in by the expat diocese.
The bishop - the parish's own governing body - wrote to the diocese in July about his concerns that the diocese would look to pass on the costs to the bishop, although the bishop had nothing to do with the persecution of the clergy and contractors who had sent them in.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old shark wounds a boy while diving under a glacier in California
A 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while diving on a glacier in California on the first day of the glacier's feast, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 p.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego Chad Hammel said he was diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then walked over to help him remove the straw.
Hammel said he thought at first it was just a scratch from the birth of a candy, and that he then realized it was a bug!
We were caught!'
His eyes were all tied together", said Hammel when he spoke to the boy.
"I told everyone to get out of the way: 'There's a shark under the way!'" said Hammel.
The boy was transferred to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego as he is classified as critically ill.
It is not known what shark species was responsible for the attack.
Surveillance Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was not considered a dangerous shark species.
Giles said the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his collarbone.
Officers closed the beach entrance between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles indicated that there were no more than 135 shark species in the area, but most were not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to land on the UK stock market.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their multi-storey style scheme passages and a special staff of assistants.
As part of a major push into the UK £2.8bn scheme market, which is still growing despite falling sales of fashion and home goods, the larger scheme passages will be tested in 11 stores around the country, and brought to more stores next year if successful.
Investment in schemes is part of the efforts of supermarkets to fill shelf space in their inventories of televisions, microphones and timeshare goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double its scheme offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas like those found in stores like Boots.
The wholesale market is also re-launching its Boutique clothing range, so that vegans will have more of the products used - which is demanding more young shoppers.
In addition, retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing permits in two shops with Sainsbury's, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
Trends in online shopping and small daily purchases at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the centres will gradually see the emergence of multi-storey shops as the chain seeks to rival the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos in hundreds of stores, and also introduced several Habitats since they bought those two stores two years ago, which they say boosted wholesale sales and added to the profitability of the stores.
Click on the previous wholesale effort to revamp its scheme and pharmaceutical divisions from the ground up.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots West in the early 2000s, but the merger was terminated after appeals on how to share revenues from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
That new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmaceutical business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125m, three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but added an additional scope to the luxury brands that would include La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have fundamentally changed the look and feel of passenger schemes to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in expert colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to fit all demands, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now the target of an excellent scheme that challenges the old shopping route".
Peter Jones after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the £11 million market
Star Peter Jones has left Dragons on Monday after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an £11 million sale of her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for its Truly brand of furniture and accessories.
Goop's beer and brand business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning host had to announce on Instagram that she is going to leave.
Holly Willoughby has put Dragons Den star Peter Jones on the red carpet when she withdrew from her profitable lifestyle brand business at the last minute - to focus on their new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Our sources said Jones was "in a red-hot spot" when the white girl told TV during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of her inner-city business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - which have raised up to £1.5 million - to focus on her furniture and accessories brand Truly.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of £11 million.
With Willoughby, 37, announcing on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of Britain on a whistle with one of his holiday homes as his target.
The source said: "Truly was the top priority for Holly.
It would be her long-term future with which she would earn her living for decades.
All those involved were dismissed for their decision to withdraw from the market.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, as the launch was so close.
A warehouse is mouth-to-mouth full of goods inside Headquarters in Marlow ready for sale".
Experts believe that the demise of This Morning, one of Britain's most profitable talk shows, could cost the company millions from the substantial investment in products such as socks and trousers and clothing and homewares, and could delay its launch further.
And it could end a friendship that had lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past decade.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cape West in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacations together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in the Baldwin television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will take on the role of Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity with ITV.
A source close to Jones said yesterday: "We will not comment on matters relating to his business affairs".
'And we fell in love then'
He laughed at the criticism he received from the media for the "unpresidential" comments some people made about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so angry?
Trump said while letting him know that he was a "major news supplier".
"I have not lost anything".
He noted that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting after his inaugural meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump had heralded as a major step forward towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
It was more than three months since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly. Last Saturday, the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's initial efforts toward disarmament.
The Commission also noted that the US is not a party to the WTO Agreement on Trade in Endangered Species.
Trump was far from being a bully in his speech.
"We are doing great with North Korea", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions would be killed.
And now we have a wonderful relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the rocket tests were stopped, they helped to free kidnappers and bring the bodies of members of the US armed forces home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about the relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so presumptuous, but instead of 10,000 people being outside asking for permission to enter this crowded place, 200 people would be standing abuses", Trump said, referring to the crowd directly in front of him.
Hundreds of people killed by tsunamis and earthquakes on an island in Indonesia
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, the foreign NGOs were told they did not have to be present.
Although no more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was evacuated from their own areas, no national disaster was declared, a prelude to generating international aid.
"In many cases unfortunately they have said unfavourably that they do not want international assistance, so it is very challenging", said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is assembling teams to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether the foreign team can get to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesperson for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the constant landslides in Indonesia, the preparations for the nature's destruction are terrible.
Although tsunami-resistant basins have been built in Aceh, they are not commonly seen on any other coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning base in Palu, although a warning was in place, probably contributed to the loss of livestock numbers.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is challenging when there is snow.
Logistics is much more complicated by natural disasters.
A hospital ship based in Lombok to treat victims of the landslide is heading for Palu, and it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the recent disaster.
President Joko Widodo has put improving Indonesia's fragile infrastructure at the heart of his election campaigns, and has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the Joko administration ran into funding shortfalls as it sought re-election the following year.
Mr. Joko is also coming under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as clashes between Christian and Muslim fighters took place in the streets, with beatings, arrows and knives, and other deadly weapons.
Daniel Sturridge with Liverpool equalises the score at the last minute in Chelsea uniform
Daniel Sturridge recovered Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri and was about 30 yards away from Chelsea and his team to a 1-0 back.
He hit the ball on the side of his left foot before he released a shot with the ball further away.
The attempt was driven high above the box as it approached the top right corner of the net.
The ball took a straight jump at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the end and fell into the net.
"I just wanted to get there, get the ball, and players like Shaq go forward with as much as possible, so I just tried to prove as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I gave one little hit to the ball and didn't think so much about it and I made the attempt back".
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead at half-time after scoring in the 25th minute with Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The centre forward passed his shoulder to the team in the blue-west corner as far as Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning from the centre of the park and racking up a kick in Liverpool's half of the park.
Kovacic passed and quickly disappeared into the middle of the park.
He then released a beautiful pass through, which guided Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and scored the final shot into the hole in the back of the net with his left foot over Alisson Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped under the building's infrastructure by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit last Friday, with waves as high as 20 feet, according to press release from agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called people in the area who heard or saw nothing to come to him.
Chief Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'We are early in the investigation but would appeal to anyone who was close to John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We would also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who have thought of anything with their cameras to contact us as they may have information that would be crucial for our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local in Birkenhead, and that she was buried inside a property.
Friends of the woman who believe they knew her have arrived at the scene this evening to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police said they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police are telling him no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he learned about what had happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be several hours before they are allowed back in.
One police officer was heard telling one man that the whole area is now being used as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene and was cleaning the dishes.
She keeps repeating 'this is terrible'.
The police had two vehicles inside the line of defence at 2am, with another vehicle just outside it.
Several police officers were standing within the defensive line watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and log 247 on 30 September.
The latest monument to be the subject of a 'historical rewrite' is the statue of Chromail inside Parliament
Its destruction would be in retaliation for the Taliban's complete destruction of many of England's religious cultural sites at the hands of their fanatical followers or the Puritans for baptizing them.
The Cromwell Society described Mr Crick's recommendation as "a waste of time" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate over the removal of the statue is expected to see the real Oliver of Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster as a target.
It was not Cromwell himself who ordered or carried out the massacre in the English civil wars.
The Coral may have been sacrificed incorrectly for the measures taken by Thomas in the previous one.
The beautiful real-life creation of William Hamo Thorneycroft on the Chlum is a testament to the 19th-century speculation, and is part of the historiography of a man that many believe is worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people, perhaps no more in the 19th century than today, would regard Cromwell as the defender of parliament against external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
That comprehensive interpretation of the subject itself is still a matter of historical debate.
It is certain that the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the development of our nation since then, and it is an identifiable individual who acts as the representative of one half of the split.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration".
Deadly pig attacks Chinese farmer fiercely to death
A pig farmer was attacked and killed inside a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man with the surname Yuan was found dead with his artery slashed, and stabbed with blood near a pig's heart at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported last Sunday.
Pig farmer preparing to inject vaccines into pigs at dawn on 30 May 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his four-legged friend from the neighboring Yunnan province last Wednesday with 15 mugs sold at the market.
His cousin came four on the next morning and found him dead, and found that a door valve with a pig's crown nearby had been leaked.
He said that there was a large male pig inside the crown with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound mule either violently attacked the farmer or died, according to the report itself.
"My fourth cousin's leg was bloody and wet", the fourth cousin said with the nickname Wu, as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found around once more recently.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan or his four cousins.
A market manager told the Evening News that the man had been locked up so he wouldn't attack anyone else, and police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reportedly in negotiations over compensation for his death.
The reports of pig bites on humans are rare.
A woman and her husband were attacked by pigs in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, and sustained critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig was added to the back of a British farmer's tractor or his wife had frightened the animal to death.
After his farmer's milk was eaten in Oregon in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBS News that milk is not normally invasive but a blood smear can act as a deterrent.
"They are only interested in having fun.
They belong to you, they are real like animals... they don't want to hurt you.
You have to show them the utmost respect", he said.
Heavy rainfall will come widespread to the southwest US from the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening and moving over the cooler side off the northern coast of Mexico.
Flooding with Rosa will come from farms across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane, had winds of 85 miles per hour at about 5 a.m. Eastern Time Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a gale is coming in across the Pacific Ocean and will move east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Sunday as a destructive storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep from the north into the southwestern U.S.
Up to 10 roses will arrive in parts of Mexico next Monday.
Heavy rainfall will then be generated extensively by the coastal moisture interacting with the incoming cold in the southwest for a few days.
Between 1 inch and 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous landslides, mudslides and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep humidity will cause rates of rainfall to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in parts of the Southwest, particularly over most of Arizona.
The rapidly deteriorating conditions could be disrupted by the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
The decision to go out in the desert on foot to avoid the danger of the tropical conditions there.
The heavy rain could cause severe flooding of the rivers in the dunes, and the thunderstorms will bring local wind gusts and seismic waves.
Some heavy rains will come with the storm coming into parts of the southern California coast.
The number of precipitations may be above the threshold, which may generate minor flows and slip roads accordingly.
This amounts to the first rainfall of the region's wet season.
Several quarters of scattered tropical rainfall will begin to fall in Arizona slowly on Sunday and early Monday, before the more widespread rain slowly spreads on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread into the Four Corners on Tuesday and last through Wednesday.
Acute temperature fluctuations can be seen in October across the US as the Arctic cools, with the temperature zone remaining moderately warm.
This results in dramatic changes in temperature over a short period of time.
A great example of the amazing temperature variations across the central US will be seen on Sunday.
The temperature difference will be nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days the final heat of summer will try to bounce back.
A warm start to October is expected across much of the central and eastern US, with temperatures in the 80s widespread over the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
80 degrees may be found in New York City on Tuesday, with 10 degrees in and out above average.
We are indicating with our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability of above-average temperatures for the eastern half of the US through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh audition
The virtual testimony of Brett Kavanaugh's name to the Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her, alleging that the attack took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political frenzy continued, with the broadcasters breaking into a regular registration for Friday's final chorus: an agreement negotiated with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake under the auspices of the FBI to lead a week-long investigation into the changes.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is one hundred percent sure that Kavanaugh robbed her while she was naked, and tried to strip her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
No more than the 20.4 million people Nielsen reported on Friday were likely to have watched.
That venture included the medium-sized audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures available immediately were not a basis for the other networks on which it was shown, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And typically some of the Nielsen ratings are concerned with measuring the number of people looking into the offices.
As a comparative measure, the number of spectators is the same as for a qualifying match in American football.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the top-rated network with an average viewership of 5.69 million viewers during the plenary hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of the drama last Friday.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning receiving a meal from viewers while trying to take an elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes on it for several minutes as they watched it, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in front of the country?
Someone said to you, "You are the power and the power of many women is very little".
Flake said his office issued a statement telling him, before the electorate pulled out, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks covered matters at later times, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote to pass Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the assumption that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which the Democratic minority wanted.
They were chatting with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, who visited Flake.
Flake's decision was made after a discussion with Coons and several subsequent senators.
Flake's choice was powerful, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing political games on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing "political games" about Britain's future and the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Labour Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson pressed ahead with his attack on his Brexit plan, or Chequers plan as it is called, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect tariffs on each other would be a "very unfair" proposal".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police arrest suspects in the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and booked into jail on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officers filmed the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, as reported by WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to Wayde's fatal shooting.
The bond was settled for $350,000, reports the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report last Friday, stating that the cause of death was gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The department is acknowledging the Louisiana State Police's task force on robberies, the state police's crime lab, Southern University police and local citizens for assisting with the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "openness and dedication to pursuing justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6-inch forward grew up in Baton Rouge as his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "concerned" and "concerned" about Wayde's death.
"That's a concern in the land", Wade said.
Current eruption from volcano down Mexico City
The current from the Popocatepetl volcano has descended on southern areas of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay clear of the volcano after increased activity inside the crater, recording 183 gas and lava emissions in 24 hours.
The center monitored thunderstorms and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of lava covering the car's windshields in areas of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 quake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists took place before the same day as the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a demonstration between pro-independence demonstrators and police officers, with thousands taking part in competitive demonstrations to mark a year since Catalonia's split vote.
The police were holding back a bunch of yellow bands with egg-shaped pickets and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Sneaking also occurred during the day, with the police using their handcuffs to limit the fight.
The singing of "No Default, No Forgiveness" in front of united observers was confirmed in favour of independence by the ballad "To the mayor of Spain".
Fourteen people received medical treatment for minor injuries in the explosions, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the region where the push for independence has been gaining momentum one year after the 1 October referendum, which Madrid deemed illegal, but which was celebrated by Catalan independents.
Voters voted for independence by a large majority, although the percentage of votes cast was low among those opposed to the majority's secession.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block the vote at polling stations across the region with violent demonstrations.
Pro-independence protesters had gathered on Friday night to demonstrate support for the national police blockade.
The demonstration went on, but they had to find a different way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separation with his wife, said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We had one of the best times we've ever had in years.
I saw my parents crying with surprise that they could vote, but we are confused now", he said.
Despite Catalan pro-independence parties winning a crucial, if necessary, victory in last December's regional elections, they have failed to maintain that continuity this year with many of their recognisable leaders either ousted for their own reasons or held in detention pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the resulting declaration of freedom.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration to support the police on her phone, said that the politicians on both sides were fueling the conflict.
"The tension is rising unabated", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders to be put on trial before the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"To stand as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to criticize the backsliding on democratic values and the backstabbing of the Spanish government", he said.
Durban: Men arrested after their home was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a house was broken into by a car in Doha.
The incident occurred on the City of Cards Corridor on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Mayor Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
The car may also have been released with a crossbow at some point.
Menga's score gives a 1-0 win to Livingston over Rangers
It was Dolly Menga's first back for Livingston who secured the win.
Livingston's surprise win over Rangers was Steven Gerrard's second loss in his 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end with Gary Holt's team coming close to equalling Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's team unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season as they face Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Rangers will be at home before that against Rapid Wien in the Europa Series next Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile adds his game-winning streak to six, and head coach Holt remains undefeated since teaming up with Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston does not score against visitors of the soft
Holt's team should have progressed well before they scored, and many difficulties were caused by their straightforward approach to Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line towards the back but made his attempt across the back's mouth, and then Alan Lithgow could only make his attempt in the back after slipping in to hit head coach Craig Halkett across the back.
The home team were willing to let Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they would damage the away visitors with the fixed items.
And that's how the back score was.
Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston created a half-century, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the box.
Rangers were in top possession of the ball at the time, but they failed to break the home team's defenders and Liam Kelly's goal was not scored,
That story continued into the second half, though Kelly had to save from Alfredo Morelos.
His feet knocked Rangers defender Alan McGregor out the door on Scott Pittman and Lithgow gave a flash in the arm from another fixed piece with Livingston.
Cross passes continually came in on Livingston's box and were permanently cleaned, and two Irish chic claims were denied - after Halkett's challenge of representative Glenn Middleton, and one on handling.
'Incredible proof' from Livingston - analysis
Alexander Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Proof and excellent result for Livingston.
All of their players were improving, exceeding their expectations that way up.
His playing style and personnel have changed little since returning to the top flight, but Holt has to be highly commended for the way he has motivated the team since joining.
He had so much heroism.
Captain Halkett was improving, overseeing the highly organised defenders, and Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall kept their shoulders on from start to finish.
Inspired by a lack of amateur Rangers.
Although they gave excellent evidence of Gerrard's time, they fell far short of his standards.
They missed the final pass - they only broke through the home team once - and it's kind of an eye-opener for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan receives a mixed reception in Cologne
Minutes and blue skies were seen on Saturday (September 29) as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - intended to mend relations between the ECAT allies.
They reached agreement on a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the media and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then turned to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The largest Turkish population outside Turkey itself is found in that city.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000 crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
The voice of hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them in Cornwall - was also heard, sharply criticizing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him back to the country.
The fragmentary arguments are a reflection of the visitor's zeal, being worshipped as a hero by some German Turks and sharply criticized as unique by others who are not.
Road report in Deptford: Wheels get killed by being hit by a car
Two people have died in a car crash in London.
The incident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics responded to the scene, but the man died there.
The incident comes several months after another cyclist died in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday scene.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and to notify his next of kin.
Roads and bus routes are closed, and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured during inspection
Six prison officers have been injured during the assault by the men's high-security prison, the Prison Office said.
The inspection took place at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
"Tornado" specialised officers were brought in to deal with the crisis, which involves eight segments and is limited to one ball.
The officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "A dedicated prison team has been deployed to deal with ongoing outbreaks at HMP Long Lartin.
Six crew members were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are determined that those responsible will be brought before the police and can be placed elsewhere in the car".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was treated in hospital after being assaulted by a prisoner.
And officials were called in last October to deal with a serious incident in which the team was attacked with puck balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flood targets (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
Arizona rarely faces a tropical depression, but that is likely to happen early next week as the energy surge of Hurricane Rosa heads over the Pacific Northwest, with flood hazards to come.
The National Weather Service issued forecasts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and will be ready to arrive by Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix specified in a tweet that only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or weakened within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models forecast 2 inch to 4 inch hurricanes, with isolated sizes up to 6 hurricanes in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Western South Pacific including the Central Rockies and The Great Basin are likely to have 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and may have isolated totals of up to 4 hours.
For those who are now out of the risk of turbulence, Rosa's fever could be a blessing because the region is dry.
While flooding is a serious concern, some of this could be beneficial as parts of the South-East are currently dry.
According to the US Trauma Monitor, at least 40 percent of Arizona is diarrhoea-stricken, the second highest category, reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes its way across Mexico's Baja California peninsula.
Rosa, which is still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is coming to colder waters in the Pacific and so she's losing power.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico at tropical storm strength on Monday evening or night.
The drought across parts of Mexico could be severe, with a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 3 to 6 inches of rainfall is expected from Baja California into northwestern Sonora, with a potential of 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then cross northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching as far as the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and enter southern Utah late Tuesday night.
 Rosa is the main anticipated hurricane or extreme weather pattern in California, northeastern Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Pacific,  says the National Hurricane Center.
The landscape is expected to produce life-threatening mudslides and smoky streams, and landslides in the mountainous countryside.
Midsomer Norton attacks: four caught in attempted suicide
Three boys in their teens and a man in his 20s were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed several times in Somerset.
The boy was found in the tenth and injured in the Excelsior Terrace area in Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police say.
Officers are asking anyone who might have a piece of mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump said about Kavanaugh, that he "suffered, grief, the wrath of the Democratic Party"
"A vote for Justice Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's nonviolent and scandalous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from grief, and the anger of the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her twenty or thirty years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegations.
The President said Saturday that Americans saw Kavanaugh's greatness and quality and courage that day.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most powerful legal intentions that enabled us, a jurist with an excellent record of public service, to certify to the West Virginia crowd of his supporters.
The President made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's nomination when speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not in my run, and I'm really in my run, he said.
That's why I'm all over the place and I'm fighting for great candidates.
Trump said democrats are on a mission to deny and block affairs.
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
The earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia has killed hundreds and the death toll is rising
At least 384 people were killed, with dozens swept away and waves washing over the beaches, when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu De Juma when waves up to six metres (18 feet) circled the shore at nightfall, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying anything in their path.
The tsunami followed a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not run immediately so they were killed", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency, BNPB, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulled cars, blades, houses, hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, saying the tsunami traveled across the open ocean at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the surfboard.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were deployed to 24 sites in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the disaster agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, complex and broken bridges and a mosque and water surrounding it.
The sequence follows the coastal city created by God Saturn.
The earthquake hit an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the end of a long sandy canyon, could increase the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "severe" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the rubble beneath the building's collapsed infrastructure, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the moisture and damage could be greater along the periphery 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area known as Donggala, which is closer to the earth's crust.
Nugroho said there was no information at all in the messages from Donggala.
About 300, 000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, saying its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be bigger", she said.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami hit Palu, though officials said a wave had entered within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateurish piece of social media footage, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard yelling and warning the people on the street below about the tsunami.
Within minutes a wall of water creates on the shore, bringing buildings and cars.
Routers were not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but food and other basic necessities are still needed for the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened for only further work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centres in Palou on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian Tsunamis has exceeded 800.
It's all over now.
While the World Vision team from Donggala arrived safely to Palu city, where employees are hiding in the obstacle fences created in their office enclosure, they went through a mess on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw many houses that were destroyed", he said.
It's all hollow.
Even when aid groups started the search, many complained that some foreign aid workers with deep expertise were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
Under the Palu regulations, regulations, financing, supplies and staffing from abroad will not flow until a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"But it is still a five-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, O.K this is a national disaster, we can open up for international aid but there is no status yet.
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of those still missing had hope that their loved ones would be miracles that make the burden of natural disasters lighter.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the shed.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped in a smuggler's cage for two days with her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national para-athletes team, trained two of the para-athletes who were in demand for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that some of the others who were booked at Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a parachutist, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, in the hours after the story of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread among the parenting community, he sent a WhatsApp message to Palu contestants, who were taking part in the beach festival, as he stepped down from his throne with a chant.
But her messages resulted in only one gray tick, rather than a pair of blue ticks.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered", he said.
$26,750 stolen during ATM re-filling at Newport on the Levee
A $26,750 ransom was reported Friday morning from a Brink worker who was filling out the ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was cleaning ATMs in the entertainment center and preparing to deliver more money, Editor Dennis McCarthy wrote in the issue.
When he was busy, another man from behind employed Brink and stole a bag of money that was to be delivered.
Witnesses saw some suspects leaving the scene, according to the sources, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about who they are should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name - to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The man they used to call Kanye West".
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time now and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to launch her new album Yandhi.
He will be on the show in place of Ariana Grande who had to cancel the show for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
As well as being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West has previously stated that the word had religious significance to him.
I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means three", West said earlier this year, when discussing the title of his album with radio personality Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It changed from Kayne, meaning the one, to Ye - which is the direct expression of our good, our bad, our confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of a number of rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs was previously called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former collaborator of West, JAY-Z performed without a pencil and without capital letters as well.
AMLO promises Mexico not to use the weapon in civilian uniforms
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force in civilian uniform as the country approaches 50 years of bloody vengeance in student uniforms.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "not to use force against the people of Mexico".
The explosion of October 2, 1968, unleashed troops on a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has moved to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are what lure young people into physical prostitution.
The EU should double the A.I. funding
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its spending on research in that area, said AI researcher and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who once worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government made AI announcements, even where the US does not have a formal AI strategy overall.
Meanwhile, China has introduced its ambitious plan: it aims to be the number one AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, considering that every other country is far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
By doubling funding, the chances of the next major AI discovery in the US would also double, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most dominant AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the Othello American Player of the Year award, and later was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee denied previous US government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the other first sightings.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee says.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporate ones", Lee said.
University leaders working on AI have in recent years been employed by Facebook, Google and other technology companies.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the US boost AI efforts as well.
"I think a green card should be offered automatically to AI PhDs", said Lee.
The State Council of China updated its Development Plan on Second Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year the US Department of Defense established a Joint Committee on Artificial Intelligence, which includes partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an Intelligence Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen in recent months in US legislation to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether or not to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether or not to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a twenty- or thirty-year-old dispute with Greece that was blocking its bids for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a fifth called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours is a claim to its territory and has blocked its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist rivals maintain that the change would take the base from the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the number of voters will reach the 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is highly worthwhile to consider accession to bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, many MPs said they would stick to the result of the vote to make it final.
A two-thirds majority in parliament would approve the name change.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent turned out to vote, compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came out to vote because of my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted for the Macedonian referendum in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name to resolve the path to its participation in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform and was drawing up chairs in front of a public building by the people who will boycott the referendum.
"We are not in favour of NATO and the EU, but we would like to join with pride, not through the service door", said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership will provide a much needed investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think there will be a very large majority in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a "yes" vote would be a "declaration of our future".
In a referendum published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research last Monday, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - below the required number of votes.
In another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, it was found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favor.
The referendum must be successful if only 50 percent of the votes are cast.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero makes his way through Manchester City's all-time defenders for Brighton back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute was all too easy.
The Argentine centre forward got a pass in the middle of the park at the start of the rounds.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open park.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green beds.
He pushed around one defender before passing over a few other defenders on the edge of Brighton's box.
He then pushed a pass on his left side, coming at Sterling.
The England starter used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to win the match over Brighton defender Matthew Ryan with a right-arm off-spin.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing it for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored back at that moment.
But it was Steirling who gave the Sky Blues the lead in the First Round.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton ground on that play.
He sent beautiful balls along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before directing Sterling to the top corner.
The Sky Blues' starter hit the ball into the net before it slipped over the boundary.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Championship group at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer would like to play against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another start.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to take the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are fix-game implications for the Rockies, who lead by one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the WL West.
The Rockies won at least a special pennant with a 5-2 win over the Nationals Friday night, but they are still looking to win a first-division title.
Even though we're playing without a reason, at least we'll be able to get a foot in the door in the three-game series and we know the atmosphere here in Denver will be with the crowd and the other team would probably be playing at the highest level of any point in front of me this year.
Why wouldn't we want to be part of that?
The Nationalists have yet to announce a starter for the Satharn, but are said to usually let Scherzer pitch in such a case.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, spent a loose practice session on Thursday and would pitch his usual Sunday afternoon.
The Washington native is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump moves to West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the case of his Supreme Court choice Brett Kavanaugh when speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we've done will be in jeopardy by November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not in my race but I'm really in my race and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump then said, "You see the radical group grains, these grains, you see it happening right now.
And they're interested in giving back the power by using any means necessary, you see the compassion, the sophistry.
They don't care who they appoint, who they appoint to get power and authority, it's what they want, power and authority, we won't give it to them.
It is the Democrats' mission to reject and block the course.
"And you will see", he said, "these last four days, "that the people will be struck with pestilence, with famine, with pestilence and with false accusations".
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee ranking Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein on his behalf, and the audience went wildly high.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
I didn't, uh no, I'm waiting for one - that body signage was all bad - the worst body signage I've ever seen.
The Labour Party and the wider church no longer exist.
They don't take with those who speak out
Although the Momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last person in the line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - that's all we have spoken out.
My colleagues Joan Ryan were almost equally dismissed because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the secret ballot caught me disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, for Europe, questions that, ironically, Jeremy agreed with previous leaders.
The announcement for Friday's Nottingham East Labour Party meeting stated that we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my years as a local Labour Minister, that was exactly how the GC meetings were held on Fridays.
Sadly, today, that is not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and the promise of a 'more kind, more gentle' politics has long been forgotten if it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no acceptance of different views within the Labour party and that all views are weighed against whether they are acceptable to the party leadership or not.
That started shortly after Jeremy became leader, because colleagues who I had previously thought shared a political viewpoint expected us to change fundamentally and take positions with which we would never agree otherwise - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Anytime I speak in public - and no matter what I say - there will be a bunch of bad guys on social media calling for disarmament, criticizing the politics of the centre, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour party.
And that is not just an experience.
In fact, I know I'm prettier than some of my colleagues because the comments I get are usually about politics.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have to put up with a barrage of sexual misconduct every day without retreat.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era of politics is the way it is now being accepted at levels of bad luck.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The truth is we are not that broad church anymore and with every "memoir" resolution or change in election rules the party is getting narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years praising me without drawing attention to myself, not speaking out as much and then I'd be right enough.
But I didn't join politics to do that.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, spurred by the negligence of the Thatcher government which left my comprehensive school classroom falling to the ground in the village, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including at the last election.
It would not be possible for anyone in Nottingham East to be confused about my political position and areas with which I disagreed on the current acquis.
To those who put forward the resolution on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country is gearing up for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour party.
But really my message is not just for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat of repression or political manipulation will stop me from acting in a way that is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr goes undefeated
Two goals may have put the final outcome on the table, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's all-conquering Tennants Premier League game.
They're at the top of the table now, the only team out of ten to go undefeated.
In the end, it was their excellent defense, as well as the way they took chances, that helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've been tested over our games so far, but we haven't won yet, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "A compliment to Ayr, they took better chances than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute shot, which saved Frazier Climo, took Ayr to the lead, but, due to a yellow card from Scottish player Rory Hughes, who released the Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the fillings and throw Jason Baggot on an unprotected shot.
Climo played Ayr's opening with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, he scored and then saved a pre-game run to make it 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and with Patrick Anderson's shot, which saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Roger Knott, who was taken off the pitch on a stretcher, and from the start, Ayr pushed forward the flood by a Stafford McDowall, who saved Climo.
Acting captain Ayr Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card, and again, Melrose gave the extra man a pay off with an unprotected Bruce Colvine skin at the end of a fierce push.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for attacking Climo without the ball, from the penalty kick, MacPherson landed at the back of Ayr's moving forward leg.
Climo recovered, as he had been doing since almost the start, after Kyle Rowe kicked a high kick over his shoulder to David Armstrong and sent back-coach Gregor Henry off for the home team's fifth-inning goal.
Still Game star seems to be going for a fresh career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to be moving into the hospitality industry after learning he's been named the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Ford plays Jack Jarvis on the hugely popular BBC show, a show he writes with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill and is a parallel to.
The duo announced that their upcoming ninth series will be the last during the show, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a change of life after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan was looking to get involved in a successful Glasgow restaurant trade.
We are the sea: the Thalamithian Bolivian hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
There is a strict air quality on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are marked by the mantra: We are the sea from the right.
It is her duty to get back.
Across the Bolivian archipelago, the memory of losing their ships against Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh - as is the fate of the shipwrecked Pacific once again.
That hope is the greatest in the last twenty or thirty years, with Bolívia awaiting a ruling from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course it is looking forward to the outcome with a positive attitude", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivarians will be looking at CBI control on big screens across the country, and will be confident that the Hague will be in favour of Bolivarian demands - after two or three years of big talk - that it is Chile's duty to negotiate and give Bolivarian a dominant position to the sea.
Evo Morales, the rogue indigenous president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - is also feeling a lot of control of the Moon.
We are very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and would change little if it ruled in its favor.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chile's land, and has ordered that it will not decide the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the CBI ruling comes six months directly after the final arguments were heard shows that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Silesian expert in international law.
And not only has the case of the Bolivians been brought forward, but it may have been brought back in the last four years.
The current Bolivian administration has taken over the issue of access to the sea, said Zárate.
Morales' aggressive bullshit has been well-liked by any left by Chile to be zapped.
Bolívia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold a discussion afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative at the Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was more vague than usual.
"It will be a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile on Monday and an opportunity to end 139 years of mutual understanding", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most hated dictators - was using the maritime issue as political support.
"Bolivia will not give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean", he added.
This is the rule to see that we must overcome history.
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it has confidence in Washington.
Ri was speaking Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to act on its word on the commitments made at the Singapore summit of the leaders of the warring parties.
His concerns come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri said he was disappointed that continued sanctions and US refusal to declare an end to the Korean War would leave North Korea in a bad mood.
Washington is wary of agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang takes the first significant disarmament measures.
Kim and US President Donald Trump would like to have another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is actually under arms embargo which the country likely sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between Kim and Trump.
Also shown in Paris is the latest line in a huge destination that is on the way to the High Street near you
If you want to make your hat collection bigger or block out the sun altogether, you don't need to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed a huge headline range of their SS19 collection on the display platform which was applied to the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
A lot of very impractical hats were being displayed across Instagram this summer and these designers put their incredible work on the tiny platform.
In the prominent piece with Valentino is a bearded hat overlaid with a wide leaf like the claws of his cloak of the marionettes.
Other great accessories included ornamented water-pumps, a dresser hat, and even a bow - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne revealed a strange mask selection as well-in time for November.
Many of the masks had lipsticks and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One work resembled broomstick equipment, snorkels and swimming goggles, and others resembled a cone of burnt ice cream.
And if you keep up the great statement, you're lucky.
Fashion watchers have predicted that the big, bad boots may be making their way to the highways near you.
The giant hats come shortly after 'La Bomba', the thick hat with a width of two arrows that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that was being displayed across social media added another major work to the mannequin platform - a thick beach bag that is almost as big as the mannequin on which the bony shell carries it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, decorated with French raffia and white leather straps, was the prominent piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: I expect large beach hats and bags to hit the streets next summer - given the designer's so many influences it would be difficult to ignore the huge adjustments.
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, which was followed in 2018 by another series of excellent examination results, which is enhanced by the success of individuals and collectively in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector where we can design and implement a school-specific curriculum, we are seeing the modern languages become popular and a growing subject choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
That is a strong reminder that we cannot rely on English if we want to foster relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest examination results this year, we see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved A Honours degrees.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students gained an A Honours Degree in Mandarin, with 72 per cent who studied German, 69 per cent who studied French and 63 per cent who also studied Spanish gaining an A Honours Degree.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a truly important skill that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages are now seen as a subject choice, as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) are seen in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons given by employers for having difficulty filling a vacancy, 17 per cent were due to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
With languages being needed for more potential job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have the real advantage of having a lifelong skill like this one.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a multilingual person will automatically be promoted to the competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent of them were not fluent enough in a foreign language to have a conversation and French was the only language spoken by a significant 15 per cent of them.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
If children, especially those in developing economies, speak more than one language, they are more likely to find a job.
Different languages will be taught in each school within Scotland.
Some schools will focus on the most classic contemporary languages, and others will teach the languages considered to be the most important languages for the UK looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with a teaching staff that specialises in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills to succeed, whatever happens in the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, languages should really be seen as skills of international communication.
Independent schools will continue to offer that choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien to watch.
John Edward is Director of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland.
LeBron will play his first Lakers game Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is already over for fans to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he will play is yet to be decided.
"It will be more than one minute and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-week preseason schedule.
"There are no pre-season games at this point in my career for me to prepare for", he said.
Trump's time in West Virginia, You Tube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of hearings today at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five deployments over the coming weeks, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote for his nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy on hold, Trump plans to gain support for the midterm elections because there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of the Federal Parliament, when votes are due on November 2.
What time will the West Virginia Trump inauguration take place today and how can you watch it online?
The Trump March at Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
The Trump assassination in West Virginia can be watched live online on You Tube.
Trump is likely to speak about the ongoing hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been tense over allegations of sexual misconduct.The Senate certified vote has been postponed for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main aim of this week's series of announcements is to help Republicans, who are facing stiff competition, speed up their campaign.
President Trump's campaign, therefore, indicated that these five moves over the coming weeks were aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters to protect and increase their positions in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so essential to his agenda that the president will visit as many states as he can, as the busy campaign season progresses", a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Tonight's strike is being led by Mr. Wesbanco in Wheeling and could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get media coverage in Pittsburgh, according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will visit West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 points in 2016, for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the referendums.
 It is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to try to boost the referendum, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Corn Team USA shows they are eager to be hopeful ahead of Sunday's singles rounds.
After three unilateral sessions, the Saturn Four may have been what this Ryder Cup was all about.
The momentum is an invented sporting concept, but the players believe in it strongly, especially at competitions like this.
So, where is the momentum now, according to them?
"They were six points ahead and now they're down to four points, so we've got a few moments", Jordan Spieth said as he walked around the day.
Europe has an advantage, of course, with four points to go and 12 to go.
The Americans are hopeful, however, and have good reason to be, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, during the day and can claim to have won three points out of four.
Spieth is playing great from house to fence and is setting a good example.
The scoring of the qualifying round became higher as the round progressed; he found a goal necessary to win his fourth game, when he and Thomas were two for the final after two holes.
The goal he scored won the game at 15 and allowed the goalie, the kind of player who doesn't lose the tournament by team America.
"You have to keep your nerve and focus on your own game", Spieth said.
That's all the players have left now.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of Corn Ryder.
The European pair has four out of four wins, which is nothing but joy and they can do nothing wrong.
They were the only pair not to hit a Saturday afternoon bowl, but avoided boulders, as well, on Saturday morning, Friday evening and the second nine holes on Friday morning.
Their impeccable play and the way they get energy from the glorious crowd show that they are both the players who need to be beaten on the Dominican; and no player would be more capable of achieving a European victory under the sun at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be better if both of them could win at the same time, but at different holes.
But it is too early to talk about European glory.
It didn't take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to beat Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four-ball, and Alex Noren, his partner.
The Spaniards and the Swedes were in a hole and could not escape after getting a double and two bends in the opening nine holes.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you escape a hole you have just dug yourself into.
The four balls and the game of fours are so attractive, if you look closely, because of the interaction between the pieces, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy changes in the blink of an eye.
Europe have played better as a team to this point and are well ahead going into the final day, but this four-a-side show showed Team USA's fighting spirit, although some people were skeptical, particularly in the United States.
Europe is leading 10-6 at the start of the final day of Corn Ryder.
Europe will have a good advantage at the start of the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four-ball and four-player draw, when they led the United States 10-6.
The exciting pair, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were leading the charge when they had two wins over struggling Tiger Woods to reach four points to that point at Le Golf National.
The European team Thomas Bjorn, who were looking for the crown, lost to Hazeltine two years ago to win again, against a failing American team, in the four-ball, leaving the series at 3-1.
The American team was very keen on the four balls; they won two matches but were unable to reduce the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's singles matches to retain the crown.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four consecutive points and he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood" after a super weekend, are the second pair to win four points in four starts in Ryder Cup history.
They beat Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball and played as a duo to win over Woods, who was weak, and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled in two games at the North, has shown great promise again but has now lost 19 of 29 games, which he played, in the four-ball and four-game series and has now lost seven games in a row.
Justin Rose took a break when the four-balls were in the morning and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the four-ball matches and finished 2 and 1 on Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are certain to be the first and third golfers in the world.
Europe, however, has not been easy on a pleasant day, being south of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the major championships three times, and Justin Thomas, let the standard down for the Americans when they won by two points over the Channel.
They earned their decisive victory against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four-ball, although they lost the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has come back from a four-point deficit in the singles competition, although the Furyk team is only required to be on a level to retain the crown, as they won the crown last year.
After being in second place for two days, however, they are unlikely to be able to counterattack Sunday.
North Korea says there is no chance of unilateral disarmament due to lack of confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were contributing to their lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons, unilaterally, under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had shown "very good courage" over the past year, in that it stopped nuclear and missile tests, phased out nuclear tests and pledged not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we have not seen any similar response from the United States", he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, our national security will be unreliable and in these circumstances, there is no way that we will have unilateral disarmament, in the first instance.
While Ri again made common North Korean complaints about the United States, which opposed a "post-process" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be sanctioned as it took small steps, his statement had an important appearance in that it did not deny a clear unilateral nuclear disarmament as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the President of the United States, still in office, and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to achieve nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula, as long as Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, 1950-53, but the United States says Pyongyang must surrender its nuclear weapons in advance.
Washington has also opposed a request to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States promises early nuclear disarmament and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a concerted way, and opposes even a declaration of war, Ri said.
The idea that we can stick to sanctions is the idea of people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are adding to our lack of confidence.
Ri made no mention of another summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader had mentioned at the United Nations earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and also said: If South Korea were the party to this issue of nuclear disarmament instead of the United States, the Korean peninsula would not be in such a state of disarmament.
However, the way Ri spoke in his speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets would be fired at the US mainland after Trump, Mr Evil President, rocket man on a suicide mission called Kim.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, although he threatened last year to "totally destroy" North Korea, but said much work still needed to be done and that sanctions would be maintained until North Korea disarmed nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no specific timetable for disarmament, saying, If it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia maintain that the UN Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must be enforced vigorously and without fail until complete and verified nuclear disarmament is achieved".
The Security Council has intensified, in a unilateral way, sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very successful.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made; but North Korea sanctioned him within hours for making claims about how to conduct a military campaign.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy a missile site, if the United States took "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that his "corresponding measures" were Trump's security promises in Singapore and taking steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course has been launched at Harvard University this year to provide extra sleep at all undergraduate levels to counter the growing farmer culture, where study is carried out at night with the help of caffeine.
A scholar found that students at the university, which is ranked first in the world, have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put together the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the course after talking about the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lesson, a girl came to me and said: Why wasn't I told this before, and I'm in my senior year?
She said no one had told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was first made available this year, explains to students the key points of good sleep habits and how they contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's medical services, said the university made the decision to introduce the course, when it learned that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One section features an image of a schoolyard, where students are picking up coffee cups, curtains, training shoes and books to answer the effects of caffeine and light and the way sleep deprivation affects athletic performance and the importance of sleep routine.
Another section says that people who engage in the way that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
The campus map is then interspersed with interactive icons, allowing participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know it won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of 'sitting' at night is still there, he said.He said modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Students should ensure that they get enough good quality sleep as a secret tool, he said, to avoid stress, overload and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode, as it is regularly hungry.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and he grew up looking for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all the sub-groups to undertake a similar programme of study, before entering the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at wake time and be aware of the negative effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's back is always on Gerrard's man
Rangers again lost at home as, due to the back injury sustained by Menga, they beat Steven Gerrard's defending champions 1-0 at Livingston.
The Ibrox team were looking for their first away win since a 4-1 defeat at St Johnstone in February, but were beaten by Gary Holt's side, Gerrard's second break of 18 games as manager, resulting in Gerrard's side eight points behind Hearts, the heavily-leading Ladbrokes team in the Premier League.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before half-time and there was no likelihood that Rangers, who were short of inspiration, would score.
While Rangers have fallen to sixth place, Livingston have climbed to third place with only the backs difference between them.
More trouble could be in store for Rangers, after linebacker Calum Spence was treated for a head injury from some material thrown from the outside view, apparently.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that easily beat Ayr to secure a place in the semi-finals of Corn Betfred.
On the other hand, Holt retained the same 11 players, who had taken a point from Hearts the previous week and would be very happy with the way his well-trained team had clinched the opponent's man.
The Rangers may have had most of the ball but Livingston was more concerned with the possession they had.
Livingston should have scored after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who kicked towards Allan McGregor's back but went on the forwards.
Keegan took Jacobs to the free kick which went to captain Craig Halkett but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to put him on the pitch.
Rangers took control of the game, but it was shown that they had hope rather than faith in the kind of play they were playing, in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he had earned an Irishman's chicken after the quarter-hour, when he beat Steven Lawless but the referee Steven Thomson did not take the Columbia man's hat.
Rangers managed to make just two kicks towards the back but Ibrox defender Liam Kelly had no difficulty breaking Lassana Coulibaly's captaincy and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi may have been a 34th-minute kick against the hosts, it cannot be denied that they deserved it because they had made a great effort.
Again the Rangers failed to deal with a fixed item in the starts from Jacobs.
Scot Arfield did not respond to a pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed to Menga, who put him in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change was immediately effected as he passed to Morelos, who hit him towards the back but Kelly, who had a great game, pushed him off his line to pass the ball.
But Livingston continued to lure the visitors to play the kind of game they liked.
Holt's team could have scored an extra point towards the end of the game but McGregor stood the ball well to beat Jacobs and Lithgow hit heads from corner kicks that went into the forwards.
Rangers manager Glenn Middleton had a late claim to Irish nickel when he had a dispute with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the referee, looked the other way.
Almanac: Produced by Geiger Producer.
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, was born, Hans Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for finding and measuring radioactivity, the discovery of which led to the device known as the Geiger Actor.
The Geiger effect has been a cornerstone of science ever since, as well as pop culture. In the 1950s, there was a movie starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger detector, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the radiation emitted by the minerals.
Evans: Yeah, he's definitely clogging up now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the name of the object is still there.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to check for malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to 'check out' and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then check for proteins that are common in many algae and then replace them.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients, who have different types of cancer.
In one woman who received treatment with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system how to recognize breast cells, the fetal cancer disappeared altogether for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can be checked for a protein, common in many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inserting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said:  Our results suggest that we have a vaccine that is very promising.
Several types of HER2-derived cancers, including breast, ovarian, ovarian and colorectal cancers, are growing, explained by Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach worked, in which immune cells were taken from patients and taught how to target cancer cells to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West began to freak out about Trump, wearing a MAGA hat after being on SNL.
It didn't work out well.
Kanye West was shot in the studio after Saturday Night Live after giving a live performance in which he touted the United States and President Donald Trump, who would run for office in 2020, he said.
When he sang the third song titled Ghost Town, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat. He began to curse the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
 How often do I talk to a white person who says: 1. How could you give a shit about Trump, who is not a racist?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America by now", he said.
SNL began the show with a mock sketch with Matt Damon, in which Hollywood star Brett Kavanaugh joked about the testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault, made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded Kanye West's obituary on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock was trying to make a joke about West with the post.
Also, the audience had complained that he was being chased in the background for the headband he was wearing.
They beat me in the back.
They said, "Don't go out there wearing that hat".
They beat me up!
And then, they say I'm low, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see the low place?" He said "I'd put a Superman cab on it because that means you can't give me orders.
He tried for love.
He was shot at least twice as a result of what he said and it appeared that staff members were humiliated, one person told Variety; "The whole studio was in his hands".
West was put on the schedule as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a performance of the song "I Love It" and dressed it up as a Perrier Bottle.
The leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner supported West in a tweet:  To one of the bravest: Thank you for standing up to the mob.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that Kanye West was "as good as he is" and that's all great.
But I choose not to compensate someone (buying their music or supporting their art) who, in my opinion, is embracing and promoting an ideology that is harmful to my own people.
It is free.
We, too, are on the cusp.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying his official name is now Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, is named Snoop Lion and, of course, the late legendary musician Prince changed his name symbolically and then to the artist Prince already called him.
Charged with attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is attacking the masculinity of a ninja.
Kit Harington is known for his starring role as Jon Snow in the fantasy, violent medieval series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor, a stereotype of the male hero, said such parts on screen mean young boys often think they have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of male nudity in the age of the MeToo.
Kit, who is married to Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, 31, also recently confirmed that he feels strongly about dealing with the issue.
"Personally, I feel strongly right now - where did we go wrong with manhood?" he said.
What did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?
Kit believes that television may be responsible, to some extent, for the increase in male nudity, thanks to its extremely masculine characters.
He continued: What is indigenous and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets tells young boys that they must be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions for us - how do we change that?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in any prequel or sequel stories, when the series ends next summer, saying that he has "no more battle parks and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a revival of True West Sam Shepard, a story about a filmmaker and his brother, who is his guardian.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was that he beat up his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show and, so, it gave me my children and my future life", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who Kit's character Jon Snow fell in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) / Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) China reports an increase of 14% in new cases
China reported a 14% increase in the net number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease affects more than 820,000 people in the country.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The majority of new cases were spread by sex, a change from the existing situation.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China, resulting in infectious flu transmission.
But the number of people who get HIV like this has dropped dramatically and hardly anyone is getting it now, Chinese medical officials in Yunnan province said.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LADT community is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70%-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Much of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is lacking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV drugs available to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters claims that a GOP veteran staff member leaked data and criticizes "conspiracy theories and conspiracy theories".
United States 1. Representative Maxine Waters has made allegations to the Senate that a member of her own staff leaked personal information about three Republican U.S. senators or that the staff member posted the information on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat reported that the information was being promoted by far-right commentators and websites.
"Fake, fake and more fake grains", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was made available online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel examining allegations of sexual misconduct, which were attributed to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak was made available sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified the source of the posts as being related to Waters' office and that the information was provided to a Waters team member who reported the Hill.
"This allegation is completely false", Waters continued.
The staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been provided, are the source of these allegations, which are fraudulent and false - was not responsible in any way for this leak.
This charge, which is without foundation, is completely false.
Waters's statement was immediately criticized online, with those who denounced her including former White House chief of staff Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial", wrote Fleischer.
This implies that it does not feel fit to be a Member of the Conference.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It should not be challenging.
It should not question the reasons of the accuser.
He should be calm and calm.
The similarity was that Fleischer was comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Justice Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too cautious during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro is a Republican candidate who is running in the election to win the Waters seat in the midterm elections; he expressed his views, as well, on Twitter.
"There's a lot, if it's true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of the alleged claims.
We will ensure that those guilty,who have continued,are exposed and held accountable for their actions, which are recorded and visible to all members of our team.
Johnny English is in Business Again - a spy thriller about Rowan Atkinson with no points of effect.
It is now traditional to see whether the importance of the Brit is in any new film with a British twist and this seems to be the case in this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which involves action fiction in the form of comedy.
Will the language in the pulpit, as dangerous as we are, be a new export right for the nation?
Anyway, Johnny English has once again been licensed with the bulging eyes to make a comic of affairs. His name suggests that he is a comic character created for the people attending the cinema in non-English speaking countries.
It is, of course, the secret, sophisticated, rising agent who thinks it's misleading, but who is like Clouseau, a combination of Mr Bean and the man who provided one note for the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is based from the outset on the traveller and international man, a mystery that Atkinson once took part in Barclaycard's television commercials, but which is now forgotten in which he left everything in its ruins.
There are a few nice points in this movie, the latest JE.
I was very impressed by Johnny English as he walked towards the helicopter as he is fitted in a medium knight's cage and the rotors hitting against his ears at one point.
Atkinson's triumph for body comedy is visible, but the comedy is truly weak and excessive, especially because "real" film brands like James Bond and Mission Impossible now provide comedy as part of the films.
The comedy seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me the seafaring myth of Johnny English is not as fresh and focused as the comedy in the form of Mr Bean in Atkinson's silent films.
The bottom line is that Great Britain has a big problem.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the British secret spy network and the names of British agents have been leaked, exposing the very small, unfortunate, agent-in-duty Kevin Eldon.
The disaster hit a major, serious prime minister who is under pressure; already, there is a complete breakdown of the public spirit: Emma Thompson does her best with the character, who resembles Teresa-May, but there is little to do with the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that the names of all the spies have been leaked and that she must find someone who has been convicted.
And this is Johnny English inefficient. He's employed, at the moment, in a glamorous place, but he's giving classes, in secret mode, on how to be your undercover agent.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is again confronted by his former partner, Bough, who is again taken by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, married to a master of a small, magical party, in which Vicki Pepperdine is too much.
So, Batman and Robin, who finds everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being hunted by a tech-savvy billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin a pleasantly amused office act: while dressed as waiters, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create a hit-and-run while going on a Volta-style surfboard, secretly; English creates a masterpiece, when he attempts to use a Real Reality headset to inform the interior of Volta's home.
They do their best for the last paragraph, but while it is sweet and heartwarming, the children's television looks at the whole thing.
Subject quite moderate.
And as with other Johnny English films, I wondered: could the British film industry bring in Rowan Atkinson, who fits his potential?
The Labour Party says it is planning a four-day workweek for British workers but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which Britons will work for four days a week, but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the leaders of the bodies to give the workers money, which they will save through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, in the form of an extra day off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would "stimulate" the party's economic program and plans to change the country in favour of the workers.
The Trade Union Congress has agreed to the four-day workweek as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be finalised before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the goal is a four-day working week, which is in line with the party's approach to benefiting the worker and the party's industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree with that idea, as the Green Party had a four-day workweek during the 2017 General Election campaign.
The Labour Party, however, does not generally agree with the target at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The party's policy is not a four-day workweek and the party is not being considered".
The Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell, took advantage of the Labour Party conference to express his vision for social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power from 'nameless directors' and 'the profit motive' of useful bodies.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans mean that current shareholders in the water bodies will not get their full stake as the Labour government could raise 'debts', on the grounds that something had gone wrong.
It also confirmed plans to give employees board seats and to create Universal Ownership Funds and give 10 per cent of the shares in the body to employees, who are likely to receive annual dividends of £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells 60 Minutes whether or not the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been delayed by at least a week, following the FBI's investigation into allegations against the Kavanaugh Trial, raising the question of the jury's decision and whether Republican senators could change their minds and withdraw support from the Justice.
In an interview aired on Sunday on 60 Minutes, Republican Senators Scott Pelley's correspondent asked John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could get any information that would change their minds about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina counterparts.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
Now as I go into the hearing, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened, the accuser was called out and asked, "What did you do?"
He was firm, determined, he didn't put any teeth in it.
It seems, however, that Graham's vote is certain.
"I've made up a myth about Brett Kavanaugh and it would lead to serious charges", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett shot him in the chest", Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And not everyone she nominated can confirm it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think anything new will change it.
What is the World Citizen's Day and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This little Saturday, New York will host the World Citizen's Festival, an annual event, which is attended by some of the biggest names and has a very important mission, too: to end global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the World Citizen's Festival and thousands of people will be drawn to the Great Fair in Central Park to enjoy musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to draw attention to the event's stated goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen's Festival is an extension of the World Poverty Project, which began in 2012.The project is an international advocacy group, which seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are strongly fighting against it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do a few tasks, or acts like volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, making a phone call or using any other useful means to spread information about their goal of ending poverty.
How successful was the Global Citizen and 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is it really a way of giving people free concerts as a gift to get them to take action, or is it just another example of the "click-through" - people thinking they are making a real difference when they sign online petitions or send tweets?
Since 2011, The Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions from its supporters, seeking to advance various goals.
He says these actions helped to motivate world leaders to make promises and advance policies worth more than $37 billion that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion has been donated or collected as part of a fundraising activity.
The group estimates that the money received has already had a direct impact on 649 million people worldwide.
Among the pledges made is The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and pledges enforcers committed to helping children develop their resources to their full potential, pledging a total of $35 million to end malnutrition in the country after receiving 4700 votes from World Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like yourself, we can end the social inequity that lies in malnutrition", Tracy Ullman, the Nutrition Power ambassador, told the crowd during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced a fund for a project, Power of Nutrition, which will help 5 million women and children to get undernourished.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, which asks the question  why do you think we can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: "It's going to be a long, hard road ahead - from time to time, we're going to fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Musicians taking part in this year's event, in New York, include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe. It will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy to conduct "sweeps" to block Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington can use the Fleet if necessary to stop Russian energy from being sold in markets, including the Middle East, according to US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, as reported in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said that what Russia is doing in Syria, as it is doing at the invitation of the legitimate government, is no excuse for exploring new energy markets.
I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to settle on energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe.
And, according to the official, there are always ways to deal with it.
"The United States, with the Navy, has the capacity to ensure that the offshore mines are kept open, and if necessary, to conduct exercises, to ensure that their energy is not available on the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to those present at the event, hosted by the Consumers' Energy Association, a non-profit group that gives itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach, when dealing with Russia and Iran, to each other, indicating that it is mutual.
The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to influence and change fuels, to a greater or lesser extent, he said.
The statements come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and, according to Trump, have left Moscow out of Berlin.
Moscow has often said that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is a single economic project that will cost $11 billion and increase the volume of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin maintains that Washington strongly opposes it, for economic reasons and as an example of unfair competition.
"I think we agree that fuel cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after his meeting with the US Energy Secretary in Moscow in September.
Germany has responded to the US position. Germany has confirmed that it will continue with the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the Confederation of German Industries (CTG), has called on the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Confederation of Industry (CTG) after recent meetings between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "Carefully" watch the 2020 presidential race, says the Massachusetts senator.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts on Saturday said she would "carefully consider" running for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider entering the competition.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government and then include a woman in charge", she said according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will be watching closely the progress of the presidential race.
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about the effect of Donald Trump on our democracy", she said.
Warren Trump and his Supreme Court appointee, Brett Kavanaugh, have openly testified.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "I'm sure we'll have an FBI audit before we vote".
A poll released on Thursday showed a large majority of voters in Warren's constituency think she should not be running in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent first supported her for the election.
The poll showed former governor Deval Patrick had more support, with 38 percent supporting him to stand and 48 percent against.
Among the Democrats, who were on the public's lips discussing a run for the presidency in 2020, were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin of the Non-Straight Forward (NSI), who is on Track Palin, is casting for Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Police arrested him Monday night and charged him with domestic violence.
"My own son has been suffering since he came back and I can understand the difficulties other families have with the Long-Term Stroke Syndrome. I understand the trauma of returning soldiers and the disease that is killing them", she told the audience at Donald Trump's funeral in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin an said something no one wants to talk about about about her capture and said about her son and other war veterans, they come back and they are different, they are tough, they come back and they doubt whether the public appreciates what their fellow soldiers and their colleagues and all the other members of the military have done for their country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic assault on a woman, subversion of a domestic violence report and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the challenge of the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to the new US policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing drug-related or domestic violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the District filed a complaint in a court-martial on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker, who was denying the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in the lawsuit, Grace v. Sessions, which was initiated by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, was not mentioned.
She said she was abused by her partner and her violent sons who are members of a gang but U.S. officials refused to accept her application for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorney, who was supporting Grace, said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which seek asylum in the United States, were nations with widespread drug and domestic violence problems.
The new asylum policy in the United States responded to a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants, fleeing domestic violence, to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "destroys a twenty or thirty year old mix of state law, federal law, and international law".
Under federal law, every claim for asylum must be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and the current ban undermines that principle", the court's brief stated.
Attorneys further argued that the policy, which banned immigrants, had hurt the US economy; they said it had increased the chance for them to become entrepreneurs and to provide the necessary workforce.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an asylum-free trial for two teenage boys, who were fleeing family abuse and gang violence, in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their countries of origin, owing to persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy statement on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to solve every problem - even every serious one - that people face every day around the world.
Despite the train attempts at Palu, the number of dead in the race to find survivors doubles.
The story was becoming more terrifying for those who survived.
"I feel the tension", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she offered comfort to her little boy, who had a fever, at an evacuation center in the city of Palu, which was burned to the ground.
Every minute a patient brings in a car.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, poking through wet, wet personal belongings; they were trying to save whatever was available.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which had been destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to deal with it.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken her back and shoulder, were allowed to rest outside the Arm Palu Hospital as medical treatment was being administered to patients, as powerful sequences were still ongoing.
The door was locked as he spoke of the terrible earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We had no time to save ourselves.
"It was pressed into the wall, I think", Haris told the Associated Press, explaining that her children were in the big city for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then everything was in a mess.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, safe.
The US ambassador is bullying China with bulletin boards.
A week after China's official newspaper published a four-page ad in a daily newspaper in the United States, the U.S. ambassador to China told Beijing that China was using American newspapers to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump referred to the filing in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - paid for by the China Daily - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's accusation showed Beijing was seeking to disrupt the U.S. election a new stage in a campaign, which Washington is escalating to pressure China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it is common for governments to use loan advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are locked in a trade war, which is currently escalating and, as a result, both have imposed tariffs on their imports.
China imposed countermeasures early in the trade war to hit a state like Iowa, which supported Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former governor of Iowa, which exports many agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is using this bullying by putting bulletin boards in American free press, Branstad wrote in an article that expressed his views in the Des Moines Register Sunday newspaper.
The Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press to spread its propaganda, when it posts advertisements, which it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast, you won't hear many conflicting voices at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing. You won't see the different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China's economic policy, which is odd, if the media is controlled by the Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He continued: "One of the major Chinese newspapers declined an offer to publish his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are kicking women voters out ahead of the midterm elections in the Kavanaugh case, according to People Analysts.
As many Republicans stand aside to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, particularly from women during the midterm elections, is on the horizon.
People are very upset about this and the majority of Republicans have already said they want to go ahead with a vote.
"These things cannot be cancelled", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona), who tried at the last minute to get an FBI probe to satisfy angry voters, would be able to do enough.
Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not say it tomorrow and they will not say it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokeswoman for the MoveOn development group, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, this "November is coming!" chant was overheard by protesters as they demonstrated in the Senate chamber. The Republicans, who controlled the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who reported Mic.
"The Democrats' enthusiasm will be overwhelmed and will give them a great boost forever", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say it's high, already; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women between two councils, in the suburbs and among younger voters, people aged 18 to 29 who don't like the President but don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which showed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts speculated that there might be a backlash, if Republicans would continue to push for confirmation of the nominee.
"This is a fundamental issue for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote or whether or not Kavanagh gets on the bench, it's also about the way Republicans have handled this and the way they've talked about it", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, there seems to be a split between Americans, who will believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies and a little more of them believe Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is completely or completely untrue and 35 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh's testimony completely or completely untrue.
Also, 38 percent said they believed, fully or must completely, that Kavanaugh had told lies in his testimony as long as 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following Flake's push, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, who the Guardian reported.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while under the influence of alcohol, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez said that her generation's Supreme Court members revealed their names when they attended a party at the time when the two met while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The man who created the New World Wide Web has plans to launch a challenge to Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is to launch a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technologist, Inrupt, is a body building on Berners-Lee's open source platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data, and who is allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt's stated ambition is a "global platform".
"We have to do it now", he said of the initiative.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create a personal data repository, online or create a POD.
It may include contact details, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's about Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available on one browser and all being available at the same time.
The specificity of the online personal data store is that it is up to the user alone to give access to a person, who has a specific type of information about him.
The body provides:personal enablement through data.
According to Chief Executive John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the right resources, processes and skills so that Solid is accessible to everyone.
Currently the body consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, several developers on the team, who are contracted to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to Facebook and Google about introducing a complete change or not introducing it where their existing business models would turn into a foundation overnight.
We are not seeking authorization.
In a post on Medium, published on the Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and ecosystem, to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network, built on Solid.
In 1994 Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet, when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
For the past several months, an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality has been Berners-Lee.
Even when he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the internet", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in World War 1 is celebrated.
A clergyman in the Church of England, the only clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier, is commemorated in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel, The Hon. Bernard Vann, won the rank on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But a navigator killed him four days later and he never knew he had won the highest rank in the British army.
Two soldiers unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "a great symbolism" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette of 28 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with heavy fire and heavy attack from paratroopers and machine-gunners.
He then pushed up to the line of the shooters and with excellent courage he guided the line forward before he rode on a park gun alone and laid down three of the deer.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German cruiser on 4 October 1918 - a month before the end of World War I.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were  something I could never do but something that goes to my heart.
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, left the parade to flourish, having founded the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt it was a great honour to take part in the parade and also said that the support from many people was a sign of courage that showed true heroism.
IMMA pursuers sat through the night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, caught Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you've been sitting in your seat all night to watch Bellator 206, which is full of bars but you don't get to watch the main event.
The list featured 13 fights from San Jose, six bouts on the main list and was shown live through the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to face each other, a crowd was stunned in the UK when the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people were not too impressed after they stayed seated until the early hours to watch the fight.
One follower tweeted "Happy" about the change to children's cartoons.
"It's a government regulation that the programme was not suitable and, therefore, they had to change to children's programmes", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of Bellator, who was in charge of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa the Mouse, yeah.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage for UK viewers in the future.
"I think, when I think about the fightback, we can work it out", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work this out until this time here on Sunday and then this time on Monday.
But we're trying to fix it.
Believe me, when the programme changed back then, there were a lot of texts going in and out and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We've scored five rounds instead of six - as we normally do - and we've tried to give the runners too much and we've gone too far.
It is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt a sense of his own sexuality.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt he was not as well-liked as others when he was growing up because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to make progress.
The 24-year-old says he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which was hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that if he was a parent now it wasn't so important for him to win at the Olympics.
The show's regular, Kirsty Young, has been taking several months off from a bout of illness.
On Laverne's first show as a man on a deserted island, Daley said he saw himself as "a little bit less than everybody else", when he was growing up as a socially accepted person for boys and girls.
He said: To this day, it is those feelings of pride in myself as a lesser person and of feeling different, which have given me the power and strength to be able to achieve things.
He wanted to prove that he was a "something", he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The man who won two bronze medals at the Olympic Games is now a public-facing campaigner for LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender).He took advantage of his presence at the British Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any implications and wanted to give others hope.
Daley, a three-time world champion, said he was "broken" when he fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Oscar winner Daley, who is 20 years older than he is, married last year but said there was never any problem with the age gap.
When you suffer so much at a very young age - he went to the Olympics, firstly, when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone like him who had so much in his life.
The couple have been parents since June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, who Daley said had "a whole new outlook on life".
"If I was asked last year what was important, it was all about winning the gold", he said.
You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, when he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their ticket to the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the starting line-up.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be around to be in the starting lineup, Dad", he said.
"I had my hand on him when he stopped breathing and I didn't admit he was unconscious until he stopped breathing and he was dead", he said.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that was the dream of my life - diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, it couldn't have felt better", he said.
He inspired his first choice of songs, as well - Proud with Heather Small - which influenced him in the preparations for the Olympic Games and still resonates.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not performing properly, has been placed on the bench of representatives at Ryder Cup on Saturday.
The penalty will be reached by American Phil Mickelson on Sunday when he plays in the Ryder Cup for the 47th time, but he will have to improve his game, if he wants it to not be an unpleasant occasion for him.
Jim Furyk, the captain, sent Mickelson to the bench for four-ball and four-ball games on Saturday. Mickelson was playing in the biennial tournament for the 12th time, a disappointing point.
Despite being in the middle of the field, as was often the case for the United States, Mickelson, who had five major championship wins, divided his time as a recommended goalkeeper and practiced his playing on the field hoping that he could solve a couple of problems that were putting him off.
Never able to hit the ball directly, even when at the top of his game, the 48-year-old is not entirely suited to a tight Le Golf National course, as the fleet puts him far from, regularly, stray balls.
And if the course itself isn't tough enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, will be competing against British Open runner-up Francesco Molinari, who has first-year partner Tommy Fleetwood and has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans get off to a good start, which is four points to last at the start of the 12 singles, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he trusted it, but he could not say much else.
"He fully understood the part he had here today, he gave me a recommendation and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He is very confident.
He's a man who has achieved a lot in the past, and he's given that to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing two games.
I dreamed more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that's the direction we had to move.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will be beating Nick Faldo's curator for the man who has played the most games on Sunday.
It could signal the end of a never-before-seen realm as well as his personal quest.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said there were some memorable things for the team because of his presence.
"He's funny, serious, dispassionate, likes to push people away and is a great guy in the team room", he explained.
I think the young sports players were rushing out, too, this week, which was funny to see.
It offers more than the play.
Thomas Bjorn understands that a great storm can come without delay.
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from his own experience that a good pass at the start of the final day of the singles in the Ryder Cup can make for a difficult day.
The Danish first played in a 1997 game at Valderrama, as a team under their captain, Seve Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans but barely beat them by the shortest of margins, 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big win at Valderrama; we had a big win at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, when we were, but barely", said Bjorn, pictured after him watching Rang 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and again yesterday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So, history will tell me and everyone else that this isn't about.
Make a hundred percent first thing in the morning.
Go out there and do the right thing.
This isn't about the points being on the board.
We have a goal and that is to win this corn, and stay focused there.
I've said it before, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our squad, but we know very well who's on the other side - the best players in the world.
Bjorn was angry about the way his players were playing and said: "We don't read too much into it.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is about how each individual player builds and there is something different to do.
It's great to be out there with a party, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then try your best as a golfer.
That's the message you have to impose on the players, that is to play to your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind you and they have to play at their best, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will be out on a limb to ensure his players are better able to play as singles than they are with their partners.
Furyk has experienced both the consequences of a big change on the final day if he was a member of the team that won at Brookline and then a member of the team that lost, when Europe achieved the Miracle at Medinah.
"I remember every word of it", he said in response when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he greeted his players at the start of the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start well about what you saw at Brookline and at Medinah.
When that energy is passed to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-matches.
We set up our team so and we put the players out about how we were, you know, to create some magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with showing dominance in the coming match and is facing Rory McIlroy in the main draw and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the first half of the day.
"I went with this guy's group because I thought they'd be good all day", Bjorn said about his preferences for the singles games.
The German warship is being pushed back again.
The newest German Navy frigate to replace the Cold War-era battleships was due to be commissioned in 2014, but due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, it will not be commissioned until next year, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Pfalz,, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but there were major post-delivery problems that greatly contributed to the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen frigate.
It is understood that they will include a powerful cannon, a combination of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as surveillance technology such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features are longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to deploy the newest refrigerators for two years away from home ports.
But the continued delay means that the cutting-edge warships - which would allow for a show of force overseas - will be out of date by the time they are ready, says Die Zeit.
The frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the builder after acceptance.
Little was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but German media cited several "disappearances of goods and hardware" if it were not deployed on a combat mission.
The shortages in supplies were particularly important because Baden-Wuerttemberg-type frigates are operated by a crew of 120 marines - half of the crew were on older Bremen-type frigates.
It also became clear that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces the functionality of the ship and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate, which weighs 7,000 tonnes, is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar ships used by Germany in World War II.
With the exception of spare materials, the project cost includes the entire cost of training the staff - becoming exponential.
The cost is said to have increased to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigate are very important as a result of recent warnings that the German fleet's power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Fleet had run out of boats that could be disembarked.
The official said the issue had increased over the years because an old ship was decommissioned but no new ships were provided in its place.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg type could be part of the Fleet.
The National Trust is keeping a close eye on the secret life of the leather wings.
New research is underway on a farm in the Scottish Highlands and aims to find out how the leatherback uses the country side to make wood for food.
The new results are expected to shed light on the unique behaviour of the flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study of conch leather wings and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton leather wings at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross, will continue by scientists at the Scottish National Trust.
Special records shall be kept at special sites around the estate to follow the activities of the leather fence during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team shall conduct mobile surveys using handheld calculators.
An acoustic analysis of each recording, carried out by experts, will determine the frequency of leather-winged flies and what each species does.
The habitat shall be mapped and then described to provide a record of its behaviour in a large landscape picture.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser to the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results will reveal the most important nesting areas for the leatherbacks and the way each species uses them.
This information will help to demonstrate the benefits of common-age management such as the creation of monasteries and how best to conserve forest land for leatherback and other related species.
The number of leatherback turtles in Scotland and across the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by buildings and development work which deprive them of their livelihoods and their habitat is lost.
Wind turbines and typhoons can be dangerous as can paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by cat pets.
Leather wings are not blind, really.
However, their night-searching habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when they are judging rock material.
They include insects and bicycles in their flight path from a barn, a sophisticated technique.
The Scottish National Trust, responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the leather wings.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect seals and, on occasion, rescue.
The organisation has established a special sanctuary for leatherback turtles, the first and only in Scotland, at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is their best neighborhood.
"We have a great area for leather wings here at Threave", he said.
We have the old buildings, lots of old buildings and good routine.
But there is much about leather wings that we still don't know, so the work we do here and at other estates will help us understand what they have in common for them to succeed.
It stresses the importance of checking for leather flies, before any maintenance is carried out on buildings and living spaces, as the destruction of a single mother's milk could kill up to 400 females, young females and, possibly, all the leather flies in that area.
Leatherback turtles are protected and it is against the law to kill, maim, maim or destroy their nests or feces.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an Albanian official of the Leather Wing Conservation Trust, urges the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our leather wings and, for many of our species, we don't know how they are growing into whole populations.
Ronaldo sings the sentence he was given as lawyers are about to put the law on a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has baptized the accusation against him as "propaganda", saying that people want to "publicize themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to take legal action against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus star has been accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have then paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking on live Instagram video to his followers several hours after reporting the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, attacked the reports and called them "imaginative".
No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to say that.
What is being said today is a lie, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner while speaking to the camera.
They want to promote themselves by using their name.
It is natural.
They want to be famous, when they mention my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and all is well", said the player and smiled at him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take legal action against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have made  unacceptable reporting on privacy concerns, according to Reuters.
The lawyer, Christian Schertz, said the player would seek compensation for damages, at a level commensurate with the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went back to the player's room as he made a loud noise, which is alleged, according to papers filed by the County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was 99 percent fine but the other one let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that the two had sex but it was consensual sex.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed at a hospital but agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared" of retaliation and was "hungry" to be humiliated in public.
The woman, who is 34 years old, says she wants to cancel the arrangement because she is very upset, always, about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged incident happened, and this summer, he moved to giant club Juve, in a deal worth €100 million.
Consideration: The UK would be forever a failure if it lost carmakers.
The UK would be forever a failure if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
He said he was "a cause for concern" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EEC unresolved, it would stop car production at its factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We have a solution", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that jobs could be lost, if there were delays at the border, in the absence of a settlement under the Brexit.
The Burnaston plant - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced 150,000 cars last year and 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU without a solution at the end of March, we will stop producing cars at this factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers have expressed concern about a no-deal EU move on the way cross-border trade will operate; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main burden on car manufacturers is the risks to supply chains in the event of the unresolved Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a 'direct-to-time' basis.Parts from suppliers in the UK and EU arrive every 37 minutes for a custom-made car.
If the UK leaves without a solution on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and parts shortages, the industry says.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day's inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore, production would cease.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan was "fully crafted to avoid delays like this at the border".
"We need to have the best solution, not only to allow the success we have now to continue, but to seize this opportunity", he told the BBC.
The evidence we have from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we need to be able to keep up with the supply chains, which are currently very successful.
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would be completely halted, but in the long term, it said that additional costs would reduce factory competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a union organizer for Unite at the factory, said his members' anxiety was increasing even further.
A government spokesman said: We have provided a plan, which is accurate and reliable, for the future relationship with the EU.
The meeting between Trump and the White House may be delayed again, the White House says.
An important meeting between Donald Trump and the deputy attorney general could be postponed to another week as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump's aides and the possibility of the president's obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will break the vice-president or not and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence is the backdrop to be heard in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wire-tapping to record allies with Trump and the possibility that the president could be removed from office through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein shed the description.
But he went to the White House last Monday and word got out that he was about to resign.
Instead it was announced that there would be a Thursday meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to dismiss Rosenstein but then adjourned the meeting to avoid tainting the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who sexually abused him, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's full hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was featured on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting she said: "There is no date set for it yet, it could be this week but I could imagine it would be postponed another week on top of all the things going on in the supreme court.
We'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some reporters disagree with that statement: Sanders has not had a press briefing since September 10.
The host of the program, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the briefings were not scarce because he didn't like TV reporters "making requests", saying: "I wouldn't mind if they were making requests".
She then hinted that Trump would have more direct contacts with the press.
The President has more Q&A sessions than any previous President, she said but did not provide any evidence of this. We looked at those figures.
There will be briefings, Sanders said, but if the press gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks and that will be included in your press briefing when you are able to speak to the President of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when leaving the White House or taking part in open sessions or press conferences with big visitors to speak to.
There are rarely individual press conferences.
Perhaps the president showed why in New York this week when he struck a scattering of reporters in a way that was sometimes unconventional.
Health Secretary writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland about their concerns about Brexit
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
The Scottish MEP Jeane Freeman sent a letter with less than six months to go until the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying for the costs of applying for resident status by EU citizens working in public services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: "Negotiations have been underway between the UK and the EU on the UK's exit, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is making preparations for a no-deal event that may occur.
I know this story is upsetting all of you.
That is why I wish to express my appreciation for the work of all staff members, irrespective of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and that benefit the patients and communities we serve.
There is no doubt that Scotland is your home and we wish you would stay here.
Crisis operation done on Christion Abercrombie when he hung his head
Mike Organ of the Tennesseans reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was hit in the head during a 31-27 victory over the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the table and fell off a platform", Reed said.
Trainers and medics supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the line before he was transported to a hospital and returned for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been built from the laboratory at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said "no information is available as to the nature/size of the injury yet" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redshirt sophomore and is in his first season playing for Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles before leaving the game giving him a total of 18 tackles during the season.
Foreign purchases will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the Immigration Plans
The plan will benefit from the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to his party.
Stamp duty will be levied on those not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury estimates that £120 million will be raised each year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that a higher rate of stamp duty will be levied on foreign purchases when they take over property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan will be seen as an attempt to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The stamp duty will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK and the extra money will be used to speed up the Government's efforts to deal with people living abroad.
The increase - which is to be exceeded by the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and rental properties - could be as high as three per cent.
The Treasury estimates that it could raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that non-UK residents buy 13 per cent of newly built housing in London, which drives up prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first place of residence.
Many of the country's coastal areas - especially in the capital - are scattered due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan came several weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp duty to help more young people have their first place of residence.
He blamed large building societies for keeping housing prices high by buying land and not using it and urged Mrs May to end quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's housing shortage.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of visible recommendations on housing including controlling rents and ending the eviction of people without a fault.
It also wants to give councils more powers to build new houses.
Mrs May said: I said last year that my aim as Prime Minister would be to reinvent the British vision - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that includes fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and have a life here.
It should not be as easy for non-UK residents, and companies based abroad, to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of having their own place to live is a distant dream and many people are afraid to sleep outside.
Jack Ross: "My last glory is to be manager of Scotland".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his last ambition was to manage Scotland at some point.
42-year-old Jack is an Albanian and is looking to revive the East Coast club, who are in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He moved to the Lightning Stadium during the summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
When I was a player I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a B cap and that was it. Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsbound.
But when I was growing up my dad and I used to watch Scotland play at Hampden and it's always attracted me back.
I won't have that opportunity unless I succeed as a club manager.
Sunderland's previous managers have included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Ross had previously been in charge of Alloa Athletic and said he had no qualms about coming into competition with such big-name people at a big club and had turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
The current measure of my success is that this club has returned to the Premier League.
"The structure and the opportunities this club has, there is no doubt that it should be in the Premier League", he said.
It's not an easy task but I wouldn't say I'm successful if I can't put it back then.
Ross has only three years as manager, having spent a season as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Harts coaching staff.
He helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and made such a transformation at disqualified St Mirren that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says he is more comfortable now than he was when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was probably during the racial riots that he was referring to taking over Alloa.
I really thought a manager's job was the right job for me rather than a player's job.
It may sound strange when I say it but I did quite well, I had reasonable input and enjoyed some highlights that were fairly high.
But the life of a player can be difficult at times.
There are many, many things you have to do week after week.
I suffer from the stress and pressure of the work, but I know that the life of a manager is my life.
I always wanted to be my manager and now that I have that job my mind is more relaxed than it has been since I came of age.

5.30 pm Saturday the perfect time for a picnic according to a survey
The summer heat wave is adding to the influx of struggling British farmhouses but putting additional strain on the renting chains.
The figures showed a 2.7 per cent increase in the number of arrivals of tavern houses but a 4.8 per cent decrease in the number of arrivals of rented accommodation.
Peter Martin from business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The longer-than-expected result of England's participation in the World Cup in July was that the July pattern of 2.8% higher household incomes was continued but the gains were still more pronounced.
The trading of dividends decreased by 1.8 per cent in June and the situation worsened in July.
The Commission also noted that the Commission had not been able to identify the reasons for the delay in the implementation of the measures.
The heat from the sun destroyed the homes of the taverns, which were focused on food matters but had less dramatic effects on them than on the farmers.
It seemed that people did not want to just go out and have a drink.
Sales of managed pubs and bars rose by 6.6% during the month and food sales fell by 3%.
This was what Paul Newman from RSM's climate and leisure analysts said: "These results have improved the trends we have seen since the end of April.
The main factors for sales in the outdoor market are the weather and the impact of major sporting and social events.
It is not surprising that income groups are always struggling, and will find it very difficult to accept a 4.8% year-on-year fall in their continuing burden of cost.
The long hot summer could not have been worse for those who want to sell food and we will see if the lower temperatures we had in August will bring relief to those who are in great need.
The overall growth of tavern houses and branch offices, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the pubs, bars and taverns sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and acts as the industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account and they hide it from their parents.
A survey showed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret social media account, keeping them hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagram pages
This has increased concerns about people posting sexual material
Twenty percent of students reported having a "main account" that they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep secret from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed a growth in fake insta pages - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
This has increased concerns about people posting sexual material.
Twenty percent of pupils said they have a clean "main" account to show their parents and that they also have a private account.
A mother accidentally came upon a secret site where her 13-year-old daughter was being tortured by teenagers.
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Principals' Conference (ISC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, and more than half admitted to having private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanann said: It is a cause for concern that so many teenagers are being lured to create online spaces in places that parents and teachers cannot reach.
Eilidh Doyle will act as the 'voice of the athletes' on the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics board at the annual meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Element has always been held in high regard by Scottish, UK and world sportsmen and we are sure it will go a long way towards easing sporting events in Scotland", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to do my part to guide the sport in Scotland.
An American was left unable to walk after suffering a temporary bout of blood restriction despite winning the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and having four Olympic gold medals in total. He speaks frequently on the BBC.
He tweeted: I feel like I'm a month old today.
I couldn't walk
The doctors said that we would have to wait and see if I improved and, if so, how much.
It was a very hard job but I came back fully fit, I learnt how to walk again and I'm doing looping drills today!
Thank you for the inspirational message you sent me!
There are conflicting views online about the advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to babies.
An online controversy has been sparked by a company offering hairbrushes through an advertisement for its part that compares women who give birth to a baby to those who are being raped.
On the occasion of the launch of the world's fourth portable breast pump, technology company Elvie launched a music-inspired teaser to showcase the freedom the pump gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four mothers danced in a circle full of flowers and sang lyrics like: "Yes, I make myself crayfish but you don't see any birds" and "In case you haven't noticed, these are just my eyes".
The curse continues: Pumped out, pumped out, I'm feeding these children. Pumped out, pumped out, I'm killing my wife.
The announcement was published on the company's Facebook page and sparked controversy online.
It was watched by 77,000 people and received hundreds of comments, with many saying it ignored the "horrible aspects" of the dairy industry.
It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product, written by one person.
They were similar to us in that they need a litter to produce milk, but in those cases their young are stolen a few days after birth.
The Elvie brush can be placed neatly inside a tall wheelchair (Elvie/Mother)
Another wrote: 'It is obviously a tragedy for the mother and the child.
Yes, but why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can keep their babies?
Another place reads: "He was cut off from the world".
Others defended the ad and one woman admitted that she thought the song was very funny.
I think it's a great plan.
I would have one if I were still drinking milk.
I just sounded like a buzzer when the pumping was going on.
The notice pass is a little shocking but I took it at its own convenience.
Someone who is an expert has designed this product, someone else has written it.
Another person had this reference: This is a comedy advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like they are like ba.
This is not an advertisement praising or criticizing the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the women indicate that they were dancing and the bows discreetly inserted into their ends.
The campaign is based on the notion that many women who pump their chicks consider themselves to be "the way they were".
The Elvie Capsule is completely quiet, no wires or wires attached, it sits discreetly within a wheelchair so that women are able to move around, hold their children in their hands and even go out as long as they are pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner who discusses early childhood development at Mother, said: "Elvie's Cat is so revolutionary that it deserves a heartfelt, inspiring launch.
When we showed the love between women who breastfeed and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to breastfeeding and all the challenges it brings, and to show the incredible freedom of the new breed and to make it a fascinating beverage that people could talk about.
This was not the first time Elvie's horse had been in the papers.
A mother of two walked down a mannequin platform during London Fashion Week using the product. She was portraying the work of designer Marta Jakubowski.
The First Children of the Silent Migrants to a Pub Camp on the Texas Border
The large increase in the number of migrant children being arrested has meant that the number of people crossing the border has changed little, as it is now more difficult to place children in foster care due to Trump's tough policies and tough speech.
What has happened before is that immigrants were sponsored by undocumented immigrants but now they are afraid that they will jeopardise their ability to stay in the country by applying to sponsor a child.
That risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that would-be refugees and their adult family members would have to give their numbers and share these data with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the Conference this week that the agency had taken the scans of people who had filed to sponsor unacceptable minor offenses.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sworn, or members of the household of sponsors, are in this country illegally, a large proportion of whom are criminal aliens.
We are therefore always looking for these people", said Mr Albence.
In order to process the children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being killed, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard period, according to migrant workers.
Many will present themselves via videoconference rather than in person, to claim an immigration judge for legal status.
Those persons who are deemed not to be eligible for relief shall be expelled from the country promptly.
According to refugee workers and reports from the system in recent months, children in detention are most likely to experience anxiety or depression and to experience violent incidents or attempted escape.
Supporters said these concerns are added in larger facilities like Tornillo which are so large that a child is not seen struggling.
They also said that if children are moved to a pub without enough time to prepare emotionally, or to leave safely with friends, it could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish occupation forces to evacuate the country immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the eighth year of war in the country.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, declared that foreign forces in Syria are illegal and apologized for fighting terrorism, and that they will be treated accordingly.
"They must leave immediately without any conditions", he told the joint session.
Moualem declared that the war on terrorism is almost over in Syria, where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "the blessed war" until we clear terrorist groups and any illegal foreign forces from all parts of Syria.
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria providing training and advice mostly to the Syrian Arab and Kurdish forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in that war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that conditions were favourable for their return and blamed "several western countries" for "spreading unreasonable concerns" that encourage refugees to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return", he said.
They are making a political question a problem that should be treated as a purely human one.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last rebel stronghold, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement ensured that Russian-backed Syrian forces would not invade the five-million-strong enclave.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has clear objectives and said he expected the fighting to target jihadists including Nusra Front fighters linked to Al-Qaeda and to be eliminated.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meeting of the new committee, which will bring together representatives of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria by the time the war is over and in preparation for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee and said that the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution", and advised people not to put their hands on the matter.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to these understandings Mr. Trump should win the 2020 election unless it happens, as many liberals expect, that a recession or scandal will bring an early end to the presidency.
"The clapham was a drama of the presidency that would never have happened then without a doubt!"
There is currently no sign that the audience is getting tired of it.
Prime time rates doubled to 1.05 million since 2014 for CNN and MSNBC rates barely increased by three to 1.6 million.
Fox News has 2.4 million prime-time viewers compared to 1.7 million four years ago according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with up to 3.5 million people watching major news nights.
"This is a fire that is misleading people because it is something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, who was showing the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a secretary of state who became president when Washington DC was attacked and destroyed.
Nell Schovell is a comedy writer who wrote "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club", and has another theory.
She remembers taking a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why?
Because it makes me laugh, that's what Mr Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the order.
Of course, the world is not like a TV show and the stories from Washington could affect what happens next in Roe v. Wade, whether migrant families can be reunited, and the health of the world economy.
Only the people who like it have the privilege of turning off the TV.
Yet it's more than being an informed citizen when you're watching a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward used deep background as the source for his book Fear, or a pilot's hat with oyster patches that Paul Manafort bought for $15,000 (which the Washington Post said she was "in the mood for) or the implications of describing Stormy Daniels' brutal treatment of Mr. Trump's life.
For me, anyway, I'm never going to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"The result of some of the things it's doing is it's like one of the reality shows and it gives you something new every night", Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment creator of "Pawn Stars", said about the show's changing cast and the complexities it puts in the plot (suggesting a fight with the N.F.L. or Kim Jong-un).
You have to watch every single episode or you'll miss the plot.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, the sun was shining and it was 80 degrees outside his residence on the shores of Kauai, but there were fans inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He could not separate himself from television since Brett Kavanaugh was on trial before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court ruling was between the two of them.
I remember back then when we were doing all these crazy things and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was just a joke but as it happened they were right.

A lot of money coming in in the hottest midterm elections ever to the House of Representatives.
It's no wonder that Pennsylvania's 17th district is flooded with money since the new congressional district layout has two elected officials competing for the same seat.
New boundaries were drawn for the Pittsburgh suburb so that the Democratic representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election this past spring -
against incumbent Republican Keith Rothfus who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's old 12th district which heavily overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the antiquities were unconstitutionally listed in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district began a round of scrambles between the party's main funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name is in the public eye in Pennsylvania after he won the highly-anticipated special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say the Democrats are a little bit ahead.
The US was considering punishing El Salvador for supporting China but withdrew its motion.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had recognized Beijing and Washington had done little about it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in July 2017 and they had a hotel in Panama until his partners ordered the Trump Organization management to leave.
Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month that State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the American diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan.
But no penalties were considered except for El Salvador, which received $140 million in 2017 in aid from the United States, including drug control aid as well as development and economic support.
Among the penalties being proposed were cuts in financial aid, targeted visa restrictions that would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings proceeded, officials from North and Central America convened a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to follow on from a similar meeting held last year and was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving towards the United States.
But senior administration officials indicated before mid-September that they wanted the conference to proceed, ending any plans to impose sanctions on the Salvadoran.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to speak at the mid-November conference, and diplomats say that shows the administration considers the meeting to be very important.
And the three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no strong messages about sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the controversy but three American officials including two diplomats described them on condition of anonymity.
The accounts provided by them were supported by an external analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Commission shall be assisted by the Director.
The next hit may be the special counsel Robert Mueller's report on how Mr Trump may have obstructed justice and there is plenty of evidence in the public record about that.
There are reports that Mr. Mueller is also looking into whether Mr. Trump was working with Russia in their attack on our elections.
If another party gains the lead in the US Congress, Mr Trump may have to account for what he did in those circumstances when he goes before the voters and perhaps a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty about this and I don't want to suggest that it is inevitable that Mr Trump will be overtaken by anyone like him in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the trend continues.
German army officers were prepared to put Hitler to death in 1938 if the West stood against him and supported the Czechs at Munich.
We missed the opportunity to avoid the years of famine that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points and the movement of the stops of democracy will be delayed or accelerated.
America is dealing with a lot of those points now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump gives a bat and a road to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the governing man behind Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported last year that he was recording the president under oath and exposed opinions that he was not fit for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times account is inaccurate.
What if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is found to be unfair - or if he is reinstated as a Supreme Court justice despite allegations that he gave incriminating testimony.
And above all else will we vote in the midterm elections for the United States Congress that will ensure that Mr. Trump has to be held accountable for what he has done?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will suffer a long, bitter winter.
I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother is a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that took her over during a diplomatic mission.
She survived, emigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to the Savoyard colony to be burned at the stake on that board with the whiskey.
If that is the inheritance, how can we hope in what we already have?

Graham Dorrans hopeful about the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will be the hosts when they play Rapid Vienna on Thursday.Rangers did very well when they finished level against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they win Rapid Vienna they will have a good chance of qualifying for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season until the game against Villarreal which ended 2-2, however he believes Rangers will be able to use that result to achieve better things.
"We would like that because they are a good team for Villarreal", said Graham, 31.
We went to the game hoping to get an advantage and we scored a point.
We may be able to win in the end but, overall, it is a good result to finish on a level playing field.
They were probably more manly in the first half but we got better in the second half and we were better than them.
As for Thursday, it will be a big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I am sure we can push on and get a positive result.
We certainly had a tough year last year, with the injuries that happened to me and the changes that happened in the club itself but we consider that everything is good now.
The squad is good and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training is good.
I hope we can push on now, put this season behind us and be fast.
Women losing sleep at night because of concerns about retirement savings
Although the survey participants had a clear opinion of how they wanted to be cared for, they rarely talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them but they're not doing anything to talk to them about it", said Holly Snyder, who is vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is the place to start.
You cannot prepare your children for caregiving unless you tell them well in advance what you want.
Work with your counsellor and your children to discuss where and how you would like to be cared for as this can have a significant impact on the cost.
Ask your financial adviser for advice: The adviser may suggest ways for you to pay for these costs.
The following options for long-term care may be included - a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid policy to help you pay for these costs, or self-insurance from your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Declare your legal documents: Avoid legal cases before they begin.
Appoint a healthcare provider to act on your behalf so that you can appoint a trusted person or guest to follow up on your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your requirements in case you are unable to communicate.
Consider giving someone a power of attorney in your financial affairs.
You should choose someone you trust or invite to make financial decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are left disabled.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his or her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Break down these details in a written plan to be ready.
"It's not just the money, but who are the doctors?" said Martin.
What are the drug regimens?
Who will take care of the beast?
Have that plan ready.
Frequent air raid on a man in Ilfracombe
A man was often shot by air-raiders while walking home after spending the night on the canvas.
The victim is in his twenties and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the head, abdomen and arm.
Officials described the shooting that occurred around 02:30 GMT and said it was a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
He was not in danger of death from his injuries and the police asked witnesses to speak to them.
Land and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications systems are down and surveillance officers are unable to get any information from the Donggala viceroyalty, which is located north of Palu and more adjacent to the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 Palu residents were displaced after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Sulawesi Central Province, it is located at the end of a bay on the east coast of Sulawesi island and had an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a kingdom that stretches more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast of the northwestern island of Sulawesi.
A viceregal state is an administrative region of less than five and was estimated to have 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi is largely based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Mining of nickel is also important in the province but is mostly done in Morowali on the other coast far from Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by frequent earthquakes and tsunamis in the past 100 years according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938 tsunamis killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami hit western Donggala in 1996 and killed nine.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire seismic zone and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake struck the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 that triggered tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast and half of them died in Aceh.
2005: A series of earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck south of Java, the most populous island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that swept into the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered six tsunamis up to 10 meters high that destroyed village walls and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya vice-reign in Aceh. It damaged and displaced those who remembered at the ruins of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunamis were initiated at the time but more than 100 people were killed when buildings fell to the ground.
2018: Land scrapes hit the tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, most of them in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on a Foreign Affairs charge
Track Palin, eldest son of Alaska lieutenant governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report issued by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, filing a domestic violence report and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes he took her phone away.
According to KTUU reports Palin has been deported to Mat-Su Pre-Trial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond.
According to the network, when he appeared in court on Saturday and was asked what he was arguing for, he replied "innocent, definitely positive".
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which could result in up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also a Class B felon, which means he could get a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
He was accused in December 2017 of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Court of Veterans' Affairs.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, obstructing a domestic violence crime report, possession of a weapon while under the influence of a substance in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that he gave a prick in her dress.
Sarah Palin was sued by veterans' groups in 2016 for suggesting that her son's violent behavior was triggered by post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of dead from landslides and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died as a result of the landslide that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake had a magnitude of 7.5 and triggered tsunamis that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems have been upgraded and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck shortly after mid-Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being posted on social media showing the moment the earth began to shake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami swept through.
The death penalty is being demanded by federal prosecutors.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of carrying out the terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been given to anyone in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov used a rented Home Depot truck to attack a bike range along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and previously assaulted pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims at one time and inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death sentence, according to court documents.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder for the purpose of rape, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "a great deal of planning and forethought" and said Saipov carried it out in a "gross, brutal and coercive manner".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov was responsible for the injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", specified in the confidential notice.
Tourists from Argentina were among five of the victims.
It's been about ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death sentence.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the War Two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is Uzbek by birth, showed a lack of apology in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the diary.
He also asked for an ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-count indictment.
David Patton, one of the public defender federations representing Saipov said they were "not obviously disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We are in favour of seeking the death sentence rather than accepting a guilty plea for a life sentence without any possibility of letting the trauma of these events be prolonged for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked prosecutors not to search for the death sentence
MEPs say NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged to march the people today as he protested at the Tourist conference.
Former UKIP leader said politicians needed to be under pressure from Eurosceptics - and Theresa May's own minister suggested she should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham mayor's office that the UK would now be "done" if Mr Farage were the Home Secretary.
But emphasis is placed on the challenge facing Mrs May as she tries to bring together her party's divided comrades and Remainers after taking part in a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is finding it difficult to keep his Chequers interim plan on track with the attacks of Brexit supporters, Remain supporters and the EU.
Its supporters asserted that it will continue to seek market access to Brussels despite the counter-reactions - and will force Europeans to choose between their own package and a 'battle' package.
Mr Bone at the Means Event in Solihull said he was looking to throw out Chequers.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be made a peer and held accountable for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we'd be gone now", he said.
Member Wellingborough also said: "I will stand for Brexit but we need to get Chequers out.
Explaining the reasons he is against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight world wars to be prosperous.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that Britons have changed their minds that they want to stay out is false.
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the rally, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition is not happy to vote for him, our party and our activists who are marching in the streets and getting us votes in the first place are not happy with him.
I ask you to put Chequers out and start listening.
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: "Chief ministers keep their posts when they give their word".
Farage said at the vote that politicians needed to be "pressured" if they were to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class", he said.
They want to give up Breadtham and we are here today to tell them we will not let you do that.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he also said: 'I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to abandon Breadth.
We are going to march the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Britain and we will not rest until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, Remain supporters marched through Birmingham before they ran a two-hour march into the city centre.
A number of activists were carrying out protests against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
The People's Labour Party's Lord Adonis was making fun of the Conservatives for the security difficulties they had with a party programme as the conference was starting.
"These are the people who tell us that they can apply the IT systems as well as all the technology to Canada and beyond, for borderless, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
I'm sorry about that.
There is no such thing as good prudence", he said.
Warren intends to sharply criticize the position in the presidential election
S.A.M. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she is going to sharply assess her position in the vice presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrats spoke about their future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There was a lot of talk that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters and the town hall meeting format used since Trump began his term in office.
One of the attendants asked her if she intended to stand in the election for the presidency.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the helm.
Man caught after dead sims was released from lsu
Baton Rouge, La., police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the Friday release of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at a conference at 11 a.m. E.T.
They released a video of the release on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was trying to protect his friend and Simpson released him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, to having a weapon, and admitted to releasing Wayde Sims.
Simpson was apprehended without difficulty and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch soccer player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton heading towards the world championship after the team orders him to take the win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas beat Lewis Hamilton on the podium that Mercedes team orders would play a big role in the race.
From the bench, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the empty beach after defending his place in the first two rounds and inviting his teammate Vettel to attack.
Vettel entered the strikes first and left Hamilton with the back of the pack, something that should have had a major impact on the race.
The Mercedes went to the one-lap stop afterwards and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action after the Ferrari driver left the interior free intoxicated and in danger of stopping the podium after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from too far behind the rear and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race while maintaining his grip on the base to focus on a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered the strokes on lap 44 but was unable to increase his speed in the other eight laps as Raikkonen built up fourth place.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri has been working hard all weekend and he's been a master in letting me over.
The team has done a great job and they are one-two", said Hamilton.
The Symbolism of a Terrible Body That Was Then
President Donald Trump has been making fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein's slamming of the Channel after she insisted she did not leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she sexually assaulted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "mechanical and greedy and false".
"The only thing that could happen is the beautiful thing that's been going on these last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and lying", he said.
When you look at stories about releases and leaks and they say "Yes, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, are you out?
Remember his answer... when you spilled his paper-- Who, oh, what?
Oh, he didn't.
I did not run.
Well, wait a minute.
We're screwed...No, we're not", he said, also, while acknowledging the old man.
A letter to Feinstein detailing Kavanaugh's allegations was returned by Ford in July, and leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from his own office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, reported in The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as she asked.
But the president didn't seem to take his call, saying during the Saturday night parade: "I'll tell you the truth, there was a terrible body sign.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body sign I've ever seen.
Following his defence of the nomination to the Supreme Court, which was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on his behalf.
They are determined to take power back, no matter how they do it.
You see the arrogance, the kindness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to put under their feet to gain power and control", the president said according to Mediaite.
The Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two backs for the Giants against Dundee
He made up for the loss in the Premier League on Friday against Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led by two backs early in the game after Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier scored.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home side to a tie before Dwyer put the Giants ahead again.
Francois Bouchard scored a goal for Dundee before winning after two strokes by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Scottish Cup for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to win 2-1 at Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the teams, and the Giants' victory in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first back came in the fourth minute at 3:35 and was assisted by Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the team's second back four minutes later.
During a very busy opening period, Sullivan took the home side back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the score for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants had the lead before the first round before scoring his second back of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side reversed themselves and again Bouchard tied them with an all-out attack at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the final game of the second period and ensured their victory with his team's fifth half-back through the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
A Death Star Controller is hired to make sure the First Men on a Plane can escape Earth's crust.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is said to be a hero after he died while ensuring the safe takeoff of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered tsunamis.
The area is still hit by strong protests and many people are stranded in the smoky environment in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower that was wildly hanging in Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was falling apart.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, which was reported in ABC News Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately we lost him the morning before the helicopter reached Palos.
"When we hear this, our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear thousands may have died and the country's disaster mitigation agency says there is a border on the way to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is still estimated to be rising as many bodies were still under the cemetery as not enough could be reached", agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Palu is destroyed by a wave that reaches up to six meters and a mass adoption will then take place on Sunday.
Aircraft weapons and business are importing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute a car enters the body.
There is a shortage of clean water.
Small markets are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Society in Indonesia told CNN: The Red Cross Society in Indonesia is running to help the people who are living but don't know what they will find there.
Tragedy is already here, but it could get much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and told the nation's anthem: I am asking you all to work day and night to do all the work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by landslides in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Flight crash in Mauritius: One man is now reported missing after a plane crash in Murli
The airline operating a flight that landed in a reef in the Pacific Ocean in Mauritius says one man is missing, after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely departed the crashed plane.
Air Niugini said in an issue that it was so from the railway on the Saturn that there were no male passengers to be found.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, a hospital and investigators in trying to find the man.
The airline did not directly respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is not yet clear what was responsible for the incident and what exactly fell out.
Both the airline and S.A.M. Fleet said the plane landed in the perimeter just before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone over the highway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That was amazing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to splash through water to the escape routes of the crashed plane.
He said there was a scuffle between the flight attendants and they were bickering and he suffered a minor head injury.
S.A.M. Fleet said that marines working nearby helped to improve the rescue by using inserted boats to bring people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents at PNG-registered airlines over the past twenty years, none of which involved Air Niugini.
Analysts are finding the night's timeline to be a woman's burn alive.
His case was made by the prosecutors on the North in a trial of men accused of burning women alive from Mississippi in 2014.
The Analyst from the Department of Law and Justice S.A.M. Paul Rowlett has testified for the longest time as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He gave the jury an account of how he used cellphone records to piece together a story about the movements of 29-year-old defense attorney Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claim, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on the Saturday and testified that he was not home that day.
When the prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about a couple of weeks before she died.
The cell phone records suggested that they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from her phone sometime after Chambers died.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
It is laid down that the defendant shall bring his arguments to a close on the Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip-hop consciousness there?
The hip hop trio seeks to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots as political messaging and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and be conscious again step by step.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have re-emerged in the UK through the influence of musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another blue one?!
NY children's shelters bring the law on a couple after being called a bat and road di about a sexist text message
A New York girl is on the run to prosecute a couple for discriminating against her after she received a misdirected text message from her mother complaining that she was "some other blue person".
The couple declares that they are racist, and liken the legal case to stalking.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she found out that the new baby girl, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"From my God, another human being", Mrs Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Ms Maurice twice.
After realizing she had made a mistake, the uncomfortable Plasco-Flaxman gave Ms Maurice a bat and a road, saying that her child-bearing parents had miscarried and were African-American and that she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for the day's work and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for firing her, and she is seeking compensation equal to $350 a day for the residential position, six months she was employed in her stead, even though she was not given a contract.
I'm trying to show them, look, you shouldn't do things like that", she told the Post on Friday, adding that she also knew there was discrimination.
The couple have responded to the statement that they are racist, saying it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment, and fear they could not be trusted after interfering with her.
My wife sent something to you that she had no intention of saying.
She is not racial.
We are not racists", husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the care of someone you were abusive with, even if you made it three times?
Your newborn?
Listen to me now!
Plasco compared the legal case to a "fraud", saying that his wife was expecting a baby in two months and that she was "pregnant".
Are you going to go after a guy like that?
It's not a nice thing to do", said the investment banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the public has not stopped criticizing the couple on social media, and they have been criticized for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not understand speech
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine that you were someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published".
It's funny now that we know he's gotten over the top with Paddington.
Saying that her father, who worked as a comedian with the BBC before being encouraged by small titles to write a children's book, would be positive despite the rejection of his work, she also said that there was "sonhood and sorrow" to celebrate 60 years since the book was published after he died last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important family member", she said her father was proud of his success in the end without being ashamed of it.
"He was a quiet man, " she said", and he used to brag about himself.
But since Paddington was such a real person to him, it was almost like having a kid who did well: you're proud of an essay even though you didn't make the cut.
I suppose that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Although he created and dreamed it himself, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My sister was dying and I was safe to say on the phone
After landing her daughter was rushed to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked for free to save her life.
"Nad was calling me regularly to say that he was very ill, that she was not expected to arrive safely", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die in two minutes and that I was safe to tell her.
And I said goodbye to her.
I said, Tashi, I like you, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were quickly going out of her system.
She died some time before and now everything was closing down.
I had just been in my seat then, and I knew this was falling out.
I could not be bickering or screaming or crying because I was surrounded by crowds and people.
I had to keep myself in check.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, devastated by the death of her daughter, boarded the plane alongside the other passengers - and they did not know the heartbreak she was suffering.
"We didn't know", she said.
I had my head shaved and my hair was shining all the time.
It's hard to explain but when I was on the flight I felt deep pity for Nad.
That was my love and my understanding of him.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women who are willing to give up cards to prevent suicide on the roads
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to keep others from getting involved in their own deaths.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a road in Britain and they have inspirational messages as well as numbers people can call for support.
Ms Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and killed himself at 18.
"I don't want any parent to grow up feeling the way I feel every day", she said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and that others were forced to cheat on him.
Everyone knew him for his wit.
They always ended up burning any room they wanted.
He resigned his post before he died, however, because he was a real person.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, became his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: 'I am always worried that this will affect him.
Ms Davis created the cards, so people know there are people they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't stay in your seat - if you need to talk.
Ms Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms Davies for many years, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
He didn't say he was depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed that he had changed his mind.
He was at the actual Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look at them or anything.
She said that the tragedy of his death was great, but that they were opposed to it: "It tears the children apart".
He separates us.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy and the FBI has begun an investigation
"I thought, if we could actually get something like what he had - an investigation limited in terms of time, in terms of scope - we might have a consensus", said the Honourable Flake on the sidelines, adding that he was also afraid that the committee would fall apart with a strong joint motion.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
It is because of time-consuming matters.
With only 5 weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans do badly, as expected, they will be much weaker as they try to get their man elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and then met his wife Ashley, who is his personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI reports him?
A vote is required in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break ties and be confirmed to the Supreme Court.
The number of people who backs out of North Korea is decreasing under Kim.
The number of people who have left North Korea for South Korea has gone down since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean united ministry, said that 1,127 people were deported to North Korea last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by smugglers were key factors, Park said.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
South Korean citizenship is eventually offered to most people who leave North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers people returning to North Korea to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them to their own country by force.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the failed nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after historic meetings in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a general way to work towards the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear-weapon-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If we don't trust the US, we will have no confidence in our national security and for these reasons, there is no way we will disarm ourselves on our own soil first", the High Commissioner said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "deeply flawed" and "not fit to serve on the Supreme Court".
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was "unreasonable" and financially unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I have to think if it was a woman who did that, they would be called a "women", Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two of them in their teens.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very vocal, almost flipping and the speech sometimes slipping from him while talking about his children and his time in high school.
He clearly criticized the Democrats on the committee, giving "grain cuts and coordination" to the allegations against him and organized by liberals angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony, which made him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he went about popularising the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
When asked if he would try to overthrow Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, she disagreed.
"I'm going to take this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court, but he's not fit to be on the court where he is right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said she was concerned as a Democrat about potential controls by Kavanaugh over the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his affirmative hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for a greedy, inclined person to go to court and expect us to do something extraordinary", Pelosi said.
And it is not great for women to take it.
There is a just race, the months and years of anger are being released, and she can't let him out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's weird, do you?
She continued, "A woman who was an executive somewhere helped me a lot, saying that she also cried when she was angry, but her advanced technique meant that when she was angry and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "I'm sorry because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was awesome.
Deora are approved as a way to release anger because they are fundamentally unintelligible.
One of the most vivid memories I have of my early job, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself losing my temper with an unexpressed rage, was that an older woman grabbed my back - a stubborn manager who was always afraid of me falling - and dragged me into a stairwell.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", she told me.
You don't know that you're nervous.
They will think you are sad and will be glad because they sent you in.
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart while running for president.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr Hart was having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and he was leaving the race, Ms Schroeder, very frustrated, decided that she should consider running for the presidency herself.
"It was not a stupid decision", she told me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they had was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because he was last in the campaign, she was behind in terms of raising money and so she promised not to go in the race unless she had raised $2 million.
It was free labor.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to a man would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm going to get any relief?" she asked herself.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so upset - with gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system for being so difficult to raise money and focusing on voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she became angry.
"You'd think I'd had a nervous breakdown", Ms Schroeder recalled of the media response to her.
I thought Kleenex was my corporate guarantor.
I remember thinking, what will they put on my grave?
Did she die?
Why the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The open-ended trade war between the US and China would be a disaster, and while the war is far from over, Beijing could benefit in the long run from tension between the countries, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year when he slapped tariffs on China's core exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The significant tightening this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, meaning that half of all goods coming into the US from China must be taxed.
Beijing imposes the same penalty each time, with the latest action being to impose tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has vowed to respond to the US one by one, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to be disrupted any day soon.
If Washington were to be seen to back down it would mean that it would be necessary to give in to their demands, but the shame would be too great for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to publicly pledge to the US.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play its cards right, the pressure from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would initiate a breakdown in the economy in either country is actually far more dangerous than previous observers have admitted", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research fellow at the Center for New American Security, who was a thinker.
Syria ready to return refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return and is seeking help to rebuild the country after being devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today things on the ground are much more stable and sound thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is still rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists to get things back to normal.
All conditions are now in place for voluntary return to the country they left because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he made it clear that he would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries that had withdrawn.
Europe is concerned with Corn Ryder in Paris.
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
Now the US has lost six times in a row on European soil and they haven't won the Corn Ryder in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points they needed to get the best of the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, had to tip into the water at the par-3 16th hole, and lost the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian made the move in every round, and is one of four players to have gone 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was bowled out for 5&4 by the lowest placed player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England who may have played his last Corn Ryder.
Sergio Garcia, a former eight-time Ryder Cup champion, was the most successful European ever at the tournament with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I can't today.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting us.
I'm glad of the world, glad I got the horn back.
The team is the most important thing and I'm happy that I was able to help them", Garcia said, excited after winning Europe.
He will be replaced by John Ram from the same country, who won 2&1 over the famous US legend Tiger Woods in singles matches on Sunday.
"I'm very proud after winning against Tiger Woods, watching that man as I grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, with 14 major championships won, and just ahead of Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had difficulty finding the whites throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the competition.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team had played in his disappointing official, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
Some time this morning we thought we had put pressure on Europe.
We fought.
A compliment is going to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
His 12 players play very well.

You must do the honors.
The other team played better than us.
