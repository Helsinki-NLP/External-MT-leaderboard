screaming to the world
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign appears to have gone well and the screams and calls out in the wild have begun to reach people across the globe.
“You have the gateway, I need Iceland,” says a woman out there in the big world in a commentary to an advertisement from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another audience farewell will keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman says she has to be the first to get to Iceland when her girlfriend resides there.
Unfortunately, she is in the U.S. and thus expects to have to wait a few more months.
Another spectator asks if the walking route to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
It does not follow the story if he comes from another time zone.
Egill Thorðarson from the advertising agency Peel, which produced the ads together with the international advertising agency M&C Saatchi, says the receptions have been more hopeful.
“I’ve seen many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already starting to hit.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have been viewed by about seven hundred media outlets around the world, totaling roughly two billion people.
The value of that survey is estimated at 1.8 billion crowns.
It is not amalgamatic.”
The main market for the whole is the United States and the campaign has gone very well even though the Americans are not on their way to the country soon.
According to Egils, well-known markets such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also been well received, such as Russia, which is pleasantly surprising.
Then there was a reaction from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically addressed.
“These ads have traveled further than we expected,” Egill says, adding that more than four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We could not have hoped for a better start.”
The images here at the opening were taken by Árni Sæberg, a photographer at Morgunbladets, with ads titled “Let It Out” in the middle of the last month.
The attacks were widespread and widespread, such as at the School Guard in Reykjavík, in Reynisfjöre, at Skógarfoss, at Sólheimajökli and in the palace at Hjörleifshöfda.
Directed by Samúel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll Ólafsson from Skoti productions and co-director Óttar Guðnason.
The roles included the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who is from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in the South, another group was in the West and the West Forts.
According to Egils, “Let It Out” is only the first song in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign but is aimed at a winter campaign in partnership with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first phase of this work for Iceland,” Egill says, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone very well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we are talking with.”
Explosive sand: Talk about the state of the labour market, organic funds and much more
Asmundur Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children’s Affairs, will be in Sprengisand, which begins at ten o’clock in Bylguni today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the situation on the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural issues and transport operations on a land that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, Chairman of the VR, will also attend the event, but he will discuss his criticism of investment in organic funds and present ideas for the workers’ movement and employers to withdraw from the management of funds to reduce the risk of conflicts of interest.
Then they will discuss with Ivar Ingimarsson, a travel agent in Austria, and Árnheiði Jóhannsdóttur, director of the Marketplace of the North, about the state of tourism services in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder whether the success of the summer is a misleading promise of what is to come.
Listen to the show below, it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career in teenage acts of all kinds.
She became world famous for her role as Amber in Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been on her lately, but she has yet to look over the road and talk about Clueless on Australian television these days.
She talks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built my character mostly on girls I met in schools that weren’t good at me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who the character was,” Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
He did not want to leave the police station after a nightmare.
About fifty cases arrived on the police board in the capital area today and says in the police diary that the cases were diverse.
The day at the police station at Varfisgöta began with the police having to have a transfer of a man who had then recently been released from the prison cell after having stayed there due to an attack.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey police orders telling him to leave.
The man earned a continuous stay at the police station because of his progress.
The man was arrested in the morning on suspicion of theft into a company in Kopavogi.
The police also had to have the transfer of two men in Breiðholti due to reports of bodily assault.
It also happened that a woman who was sitting in a shopping mall in Kopavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was therefore called to the police.
There was also a car theft in the city centre this morning.
A white Renault ambassador’s driver searched for her for a moment and she was then taken free of charge.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Happiness – The Terrible Fate of the Happiness Stars
That theory has spread on the Internet that the curse rests over the show of The Beatles, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, becoming thus the third most prominent of the episodes to leave life far ahead of the century.
The Glee shows are popular shows of singing, dancing and joy.
The participants talked about so-called high school youth joys, their aspirations and fate.
It was not always taken out with the desire to be in the band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the actors seemed to overcome every situation that came up in their lives.
But outside of the scene, great disasters have plagued the actors and staff of the shows, so much that theories have awakened that the curse rests on the shows.
Naya Marie Rivera went on to play the role of Santona Lopez in the shows, a rapper who didn’t call all of her grandmother.
After the show ended, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had her first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and then divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to present a boyfriend and the case of domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8, it was that Riveru was missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat ride on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found asleep in a rescue vest on board the boat and could report to the police that he and his mother had stumbled to the ground and so Rivera would have brought him back into the boat but never returned there.
An extensive search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police officer in the area noticed that the search was based on the assumption that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and officially sentenced to death.
She is believed to have crashed into the water and renewed her last demands to save her son.
Drunk was caused by an accident.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American footballer who played a key role in bringing the Band of Joy to fame and respect.
Outside the scenes, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had been struggling with addiction and found it difficult to get rid of it.
In 2013, his co-workers in the shows found enough, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went on treatment and everything seemed to look better.
Just two months after he ended his treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein turned out to be a deadly mixture of vicious drugs and alcohol.
It wasn’t supposed to be a matter of will.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his resistance to vertigo had decreased so much that the doses he had previously tolerated well proved deadly.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His passion was heavy on his colleagues, but under the guidance of his opponent actress, Lea Michele, it was decided to keep the series going on and dedicate the whole part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah “Puck” Puckerman in the shows, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his colleagues in the Joy Band, or until he gained the courage to admit that he liked singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his home in Los Angeles on suspicion of child pornography.
During a search at his home, a huge amount of child abuse was found and the matter was soon questioned publicly.
Salling was already there.
He was later charged and convicted for his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, as well as having to be registered for sex offenders and seek treatment for child abuse.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then released from insurance, was found dead near his home.
Danish was suicide.
It was not just the actors of the plays that fell from a long time ago.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the shows.
He suddenly fell asleep in 2013, only 41 years old.
There was also a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of superstar Julia Roberts and her sister didn’t carry the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great governance and disrespectful appearance.
Motes committed suicide in 2014, but she suffered from severe depression.
She left a letter to her boyfriend in which she asked her mother and sister, among others, to be responsible for how it went to her.
“My mother and my so-called brothers and sisters have nothing left of me except the reminder that they were the ones who caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been sought to apply her assistants to a coveted and transitional position and to have a transitory constellation.
Jesse Luken played a guest role in the shows in 2012.
He was arrested and arrested for bullying in 2019, which caused a lot of shock.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
It happened in 2010 that unclean computer criminals got into nectar images of her and posted on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the plays and had a love relationship outside the plays.
Benoist later discovered that Jenner had used her violence in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases children’s maturity when they get to play outdoors in the garden with their parents growing flowers and get to watch them grow and bloom.
It is also endlessly possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the kids in the garden is something that is never forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the glory and, of course, the precious time they spent with their parents.
Buying a boat after 10 hours
“I don’t think we’re a lot of sailors working in the country’s sports schools,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, who studies beach fishing in the summer but studies psychology at the University of Iceland over the winter.”
Beach fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you are in school.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I feel great to be able to let go of studying.
The income also fits me well in the winter,” says Axel Örn Guðmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who plays on the beach this summer as well as last summer.
Axel was recently laid to a bridge in Tálknafjord when a reporter got a conversation with him late in the evening earlier this week.
“In the summer when I was in the tenth grade, I took command rights for boats that are under twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I graduated from elementary school.
I have been fishing on my boat ever since.
I bought the boat used by my friend, Hartmann Jónssyni, and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann had grown up when I bought the boat and ceased to be at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat was named after him.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," Axel says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I signed a contract with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
So I had the boat debt-free at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a boy have one and a half million to pay out in a boat when he had just graduated from elementary school?
“I had already plotted and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all some hunting with him and got my piece.
I also put my money in my boat.”
Axel was born in Isafiri, where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
“I can hunt here in the western area because I have a law house with my grandmother in Issafjord.
I learned this area here in the west of roots with my dad.
I move between distances depending on how I feel, because this hunting area covers the entire West River.
Although I feel best to be in the west, I have also provided around Snæfellsnet and beyond.
I’ve also given the sun but preferably a grassleep,” says Axel, who always burns one fire in the morning and says sometimes speaking to the moose and singing to the sky, in the solitary hours together outdoors on the balcony.
“The internet on the sea is good, so I can make phone calls, listen to television shows and music.
I don’t want to be alone on the boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing, but sometimes something has been in the weather, but never a big stop,” says Axel, who is lucky that he is never sick.
He says the length of the working day depends on how the hunting goes each time.
“In beach fishing, I’ve never been hunting more than 14 hours at a time, but I’ve also been hunting in other schemes, for example in the lease quota, but then I’ve been continuously in a one-and-a-half solar circle in the pastures outdoors at sea fishing.”
He says the beach fishing event is so that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he feels disappointing.
“Other limitations are that I can’t hunt on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and I can only hunt twelve days a month, these four months of beach fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their hunting day according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on men to lick instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose their own head.
So the area change could happen to me too, and marine areas that are well-located with the fisherman should enjoy it,” says Axel, who draws most of the thork from the sold sea on his beach fishing, but also only the ufsa and unique other species fly with.
Axel works over the winter with college students at the Nupi School in Kopavogi.
“I don’t think we’re a lot of sailors working in the country’s play schools,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work on a temporary basis at the play school.
“I got there because I think it’s a great job.
I hope that psychology will be useful to me in the future at the level of play school,” says Axel, who is also a far-reaching student in business.
Villa in registration prevented home access
An error in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country was due to the fact that an individual, resident here in the country, was not called back to the sampling.
It is not a requirement to register a certificate if the person fills out the form in English, as is the case when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be examined this week,” says an expert in the field of health care.
Three people were diagnosed at the National Hospital’s virology department yesterday.
One of those who proved positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on the so-called immigration gate came into force.
Those who were resident in Iceland are then disguised upon arrival in the country and again preached in a sampling four to five days later.
In the afternoon news RÚV that the person had, however, followed the old system.
The demonstration at the border was negative and he was not called back into shaming for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, an expert in the field of pharmaceutical medicine, said in an interview with the news agency that this could be due to an error in the electronic record sheet.
Filling people out the registration form in English is not a condition to insert a certificate like it is in the Icelandic version.
It is primarily intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the applicant did not automatically receive an invitation to come to the sampling.
Kamilla says many, however, have followed the rules on resettlement even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been alert to sending people in the sampling back after it arrived in the country.
“This week will look at how to make it easier for people to access this to attract attention in the process.”
The man is in isolation and six have been placed in captivity.
They all went to a sample, but two began to show symptoms.
Infection is currently ongoing for the three infections that were diagnosed yesterday, but it is largely closed due to two infections on Friday.
In both cases, the classification of the Icelandic hereditary diagnosis has revealed that there are varieties of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In another case, the ties have been directed to Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other European countries.
Camilla says it should be for tomorrow where the other virus would come from.
In total, there are now 15 in isolation according to the website COVID.
135 are in stock.
Four out of five infections
Five domestic missiles have been detected here in the last few days.
Four of them are completely unrelated and the source of the infection that emerged at the Rey Cup sporting event yesterday has not been identified.
Infection is still present.
Originally, the third dozen were sent individually to the suburb, but they were reduced to sixteen.
In total, 34 people are on vaccine due to these new infections that were diagnosed yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that an infection is revealed at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such an event.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, Director of Communications at the Department of Public Defense, says it very slowly, as long as people follow standards and rules.
“We are constantly pressing for everyone who lives here that it needs to keep up with individual infectious agents.
We also need to urge people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
It can be done,” says Johanna.
He says that the infection can be prevented by keeping an individual infection agent in the air.
The rules and regulations are also under constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Public Defense and the Department of National Medicine are constantly urging people to do, is to be mindful of these individual infectious agents.
Both at home and so on with service companies.
People are washing their hands and wearing sweat.
It prevents the infection from going on,” says Johan.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path we have been on in order to keep up with the achievements we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes and she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day he was dead.
The face was reduced to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was identified on the death certificate as an underlying condition, and Brumfield, who is also suffering from diabetes, fears that the same should go away.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield’s fears are not without reason.
Figures from a new study conducted by U.S. authorities show that 40% of those who died had diabetes 2 as their underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who have not reached the age of 65 is examined, the percentage increases by half.
A study by the U.S. Disease Control Commission (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, an expert on infectious diseases at the CDC, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
At a slow rate, Reuters made a survey and pointed out the responses from the 12 countries that responded to comparable rates.
Ten states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have not yet been identified for underlying diseases.
“Sickness was already aging in a slow pace.
Now COVID-19 has broken down like a powerful age,” said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, who have also worsened from the coronavirus.
One of the best defences for those with diabetes 2 is to keep the disease in check with exercise, a low diet, and the help of health professionals.
The Coronavirus Age, however, has made it difficult for many to keep routine for weeks.
Then, the high price of insulin has forced some to continue to attend work and thus cease to be exposed to the virus.
Reuters indicates that U.S. authorities may have been aware of the danger that people with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus surfaced in 2003, more than 20% had the disease, and in the swine flu era in 2009 this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were admitted to gestational treatment had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus could last longer, the catastrophe has wiped the hole of a number of previously unknown consequences.
“I fear we will see a flooding of problems when this is done,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the World Diabetes Association.
Doctors have warned that the coronavirus age could indirectly lead to increases in concomitant related diabetes, including kidney disease and kidney dysfunction.
As direct new research to the fact that the coronavirus could lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says researchers are trying to understand the link between coronavirus and diabetes 2.
The virus affects the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then a high ratio of glucose and lipids in diabetics can trigger a real “floating storm,” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Disrupted intestinal cells can also lead to inflammation which, in turn, can cause deadly blood clots.
“It’s all a big puzzle,” Dela Cruz says.
“It’s all interrelated.”
The news was corrected.
“We got champagne, so they left the room.”
Husbands Ásrún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason received an unusual invitation from the painter Ragnari Kjartanssyni to have sex in front of a camera for the works that the artist was setting up in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets when he first met his wife and babysitter, Asrunu Magnussotter, for the first time.
“I was very impressed by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but it also seemed very cute to me.
And still thick,” he says.
Remember this too, even if your spouse repeats the first meeting regularly.
“I always hear this story.
Last only on the weekend,” says the woman who was also attracted to her husband at the first date.
“I felt and feel so much anxiety around Atla, which I like.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I was impressed by it.”
Atli says the couples have emphasized it in their relationship to go their own ways.
“We don’t bind our bags with the same nodes as our passengers.
We avoid the rubies that we break around us.”
There is probably the reason why they took the matter from the painter Ragnari Kjartansyn just gladly, although it would be hesitant to say unusual.
“Our common friend Kristin Anna has contacted us and asks if we can come to dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörgu’s wife Ragnars, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps and received a dessert wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who guided them through his plans for a painting exhibition he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a number of videos called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Ásrún says he described the work as a banal and decadent reminder of the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the senses he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part.”
The afternoon that Ragnar asked the couple to participate was meant to show young intersex couples to love in a minimalist room.
“These are connections with a beginning and an end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much, although they knew about him and he about them “but they knew us and felt we fit in this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise.
Per they thought they’t get the right people, but people who get sexual enthusiasm from performing for others.”
They called Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we kicked off Snaps, we said, ‘Are we not just there for this?
It was just so.
I trust Ragnari as the artist and his entire team,” says Ásrún and Atli assumes.
“It’s about love and closeness.”
Later, he was taken up in a nice apartment on the Myrgata.
There was a very complicated film team; a cooker, Ragnar and a musician and a couple.
After the lighting had been on recording left all the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Asrún.
“We haven’t decided how we should be.
We got some little guidance but we tried to forget the time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Ásrún.
Was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a bit romantic,” says Atli and Asrún agrees.
“We were invited to champagne before they left the room.
It was like a vacation in a nice hotel in Paris.
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the work that moved them.
“When Tommi the cooker looked at this, he cried, he thought it was so beautiful,” says Atli.
“It’s just as much about love and intimacy as about the relationships themselves,” says Ásrún.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and Atli says his mother heard the voice in the son at the Reykjavik Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts talking about it,” says Atli.
My mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this, but then my dad just sent me a message saying, “It’s nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo.”
And has the involvement in the work deepened the relationship between Asrún and Atla?
“We’re still together, so maybe something deepened.
This deepened my relationship with the connected family,” says Ásrún and laughs.
I saw the work in a shopping mall with my colleague.
“I found it a bit difficult not to be with you, but someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was fun to see this because it’s just one late in a much larger work and when you see it with the other works, it’s really great.
I could get rid of it and I was proud of it.
And there was a small baby in my stomach,” says Asrun, who was pregnant with the couple’s second child when the baby was picked up.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen spoke to them Asru and Atla in Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea wins in first finals
Swansea won 1-0 over Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the preliminary final to get up in the English national team.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The position in the half was 0-0.
In the 64th minute, Swansea’s locals gained a win, but Andre Ayew broke the point and left the defensive.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, the Brentford player, received the red card.
Brentford played the rest of the game a man less and in the 82nd minute the players of Swansea took advantage of the team gap.
Andre Ayew then added the blanket by scoring a great goal and secured Swansea 1–0 victory.
Swansea leads 1–0 in the squad, while the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford home.
5 years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in a media shock after CBS in the morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard where he feared for his life.
It hasn’t been easy for the President of the United States to send an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst resigned as U.S. Ambassador in April 2009, she has been emissary-free in the country for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst resigned under special circumstances, but Kastljós announced in 2009 that she should have received the Ordinance.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a call from the Presidential Office saying that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
Sixteen months went by until Van Voorst’s successor took office in September 2010.
In some ways it can be attributed that Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador, but he resigned.
At the end of the job took Loius Ariega had then worked in the Foreign Service for the decades.
He then resigned in the autumn of 2013 and took office as an ambassador to Guatemala.
Then we had another ambassadorless period.
Robert Barber was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and took office shortly afterwards, but then no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a politician, not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and a short-term candidate for Barack Obama.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusual to appoint both ambassadors and senior officials in the Washington administration system.
Therefore, it took two years for the U.S. Congress to call Jeffrey Ross Gunter at his meeting to ask him for the speeches and confirm his termination as ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony in parliament, he said he had never been to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who is dead, had been broken by a Dutch mountain.
Gunter is a politician, was previously a dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded them, while Adelson is an active supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since the beginning of 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest recorded in the country.
The reason is both how long the Trump administration was appointing people in key roles as well as that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has drawn a lot on the length, including considering confirming an ambassador in office.
Since 2009, it has been embassies-free in Iceland for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented implementations by the embassy that opened the new headquarters at Engjateig.
The operations are estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion dollars, but the building is surrounded by thick security walls and shut-up glasses are in all the windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador’s security because he is said to fear for his life and has sought armed lifeguard.
Former IBV player accused of racism in Iceland: “It was a mistake to come to Iceland”
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he has experienced racism when he was in Iceland and he notices that he has come to the country.
This is stated in an interview with Tonny, which appeared on the Hungarian newspaper Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in Uganda's top division.
In an interview with Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about many things, including his time here in Iceland while playing with IBV, Val and Trrótti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to.
The team’s forward was in that position, but in addition he also had the triple number I wanted so I didn’t get anything I wanted,” says Tonny, who played on the right side of the stage with the IBV.
Among what Tonny talks is the racism he suffered in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“This happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was being told to me.
Later I learned about the case and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had raised racist comments on me after I beat him.”
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he made the mistakes he saw most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the start team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have gotten the opportunity I wanted to get,” says Tonny, but he hoped that if he would play well in Norway, he would probably get further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has fulfilled his dream of reaching the European Grand Prix.
A serpent in a woman’s neck
Doctors at St. Luke’s International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8 cm long black snake in the neck of a woman looking there.
The doctor pulled the snake out.
The investigation revealed that there were speaking of pests.
CNN reports about it.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which is a thin meat slice.
The woman recovered quickly after the snake was removed but the pests on board are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi broke out in the West, cases of pesticide infestation in people have increased, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is beginning in Europe
Spain is currently under fire in connection with concerns about a second wave of coronavirus in Europe, but there the government has taken steps to start the spread of the coronavirus age again.
In Catalonia, all the entertainment has been on the ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where the infection is on the rise.
Other European countries have also taken action in response to the spread of the infection in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to take an airport when returning from Spain, as in Norway, and French have been warned about traveling to Spain.
Infections are also growing again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance in stopping the spread of the virus and bringing the economy back to life.
The situation in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the number of new infections worldwide is close to 300,000 per day, but the most infections are counted in America and South Asia.
The confirmed infections have reached 16 million worldwide, according to a census by the Johns Hopkins University, and the deaths confirmed to be linked to the virus are 644 thousand.
The works of Moses are finally able to enjoy themselves to the fullest
In front of the Customs House in Reykjavik is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men wearing orange helmets.
There is also a grave.
And more smaller machines.
The street is closed to traffic.
But it’s possible, and many people are now standing there and honoring millions of mosaic works—like they’ve never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least it did not seem.
The work has so far been quite hidden, directly in front there were parking spaces that were always closed.
People laid there, locked the car in a hurry and then jumped off to do their business in the city center.
“Vivable and diverse public spaces” and “attractive urban spaces” are guidelines for the ongoing reform of the Security Guard.
The goal is to decorate the area and allow the mosaic of the Holy Lady at the Customs House to enjoy the view better.
In front of the building will be a square and since the area is well exposed to the sun it is considered well suited as a residential area for road users.
The artwork will be exposed and the content will now enjoy more than ever on this 142 square meter surface.
In the area will also be small “tokuadas”, some kind of water sculptures, which offer play and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the repairs are described by Reykjavik City, which is implementing together with Veitum.
Floors of water, heat and electricity will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their age, but the school and cold water laws date from 1925 and have therefore served residents and in the city center for a century.
Once the road is reopened, cars can drive around it again.
But it will still be isolated and as it creates a quieter and more accessible space for walkers.
In a story about the Customs House on the website of the customs officer, it is said that the house was taken into use in 1971 and its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because the fire reached through the house, 250 square meters of windowless walls formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such floors would have a negative impact on the overall design, if no special measures were taken to adorn the appearance of the house.
The parties therefore agreed to calculate by letting a permanent work of art be installed there.
During this time went a lot of words of the Holy Lady, the artist, says in the summary.
She had worked a lot on mosaic works in Germany and beyond.
The question was to first contact her before it was decided whether the subject would be a competition for the work.
It had often been discussed that the work needed to reflect the life at the port, although the port had been living in Reykjavik since it was built.
When she talked to the artist, she had to track the idea of such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before moving back from her country of exile, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerd was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home she made a few suggestions for discussion.
He agreed without delay to ask her to do the work.
Furthermore, it was sought to conclude a comprehensive agreement with her and the famous German art company, the Oidtmann brothers, but Gerður had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Agreements succeeded and Gerður worked the work under the installation of the workshops of their brothers, who then saw the installation at the Customs House.
All the work was solved exceptionally well by hand, both by the Holy Lady and Oidtmann Brothers, says the summary.
Since then, the Icelandic weather has survived.
It took Gerd about two years to work on the project, which was worked and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Customs House was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing for more agencies to move out on land
Asmund Einar Daðason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public agencies will be moved to the country in the near future.
This was stated by the minister in the show Explosive on the street in the afternoon.
Recently, it was announced that the Housing and Construction Facility's burning area will be moved north to Sauðárkrók in autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work at the agency but none of them intend to follow the agency north, and the National Association of Firefighters and Medical Officers has criticized the animal transportation.
“I think we should take another step in this creature.
I am preparing another step in this creature.
More transportation,” said Asmund.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation would like to see more spread of public institutions across the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further political decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, similar to what I was doing with the Household and Construction Agency,” said Ásmundur, but he also took examples of other institutions that have been transferred to the country and are of great importance for communities outside the country, such as the transfer of the Food and Construction Agency to Selfoss, Iceland Landmessing to Akraness and unemployment insurance in the Skagaströnd.
All the most important things from the second day of the Championship
The 94th Icelandic Free Sports Championship ended today at Þórsvelli in Akureyri.
A few matches were set on the second day of the competition.
An exciting competition was planned for the most successful women in Þórsvelli, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH placed Iceland in the most successful in 2014, which lasted until Elizabeth Rut Rúnarsdóttir from Ireland added the rating in May last year.
Vigdís won the Icelandic Championship back earlier this summer and has been in fan form last year, but she has tripled the Icelandic Championship what remains of some.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with an injury and has not reached her coat today.
She had only one weight of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60,08 meters in her last attempt and set the way of the match.
Her island measure she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was therefore somewhat away from that.
Guðrún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from Ireland had the second best shot of the day, but she added her best score with a hike up at 50,18 meters.
In the men's group, the FH-ingle Hilmar Örn Jónsson, Icelanders in the highest score, won a secure victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his next final cast and set the match.
His island size in the field is 75.26 meters.
Godni Valur Guðnason, Olympic champion and Icelandic champion in the circle, won a ball racing race on Þórsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in the circle which is his main discipline.
Iceland’s Gudna Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson dropped the second longest today, but he had a single-value shot that suited the second seat, 49,43 meters.
Hafdís Sigurðardóttir, Icelandic long-haul, won the long-haul ship with overheads, but Hafdís jumped the longest 6.25 meters today, which is 40 cm from her island.
In the women's 200 meters race, it was the Irishman Guðbjörg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who was the hardest, but she scored in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic score in the field is 23.45 seconds.
Gudbjörg Jóna was a victory in Akureyri but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in the 100 meters race and in the 4 x 100 meters run and then also in the 4 x 400 meters run today.
In the men’s group, Kolbeinn Höður Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200 meter race at 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of Óliver Mána Samúelssyni from Ármanni.
Like Godbjörg Jóna, Kolbein Höder won gold in the 100 meters yesterday as well as in the 400 meters race.
Don't Get a 27 Million Dollar Fine for Bitcoin Collection
The Supreme Tax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who claimed fines on a man for underestimating his financial income that was generated from the sale of the electronic currency Bitcoin.
The committee concludes that the tax investigator had not provided a clear argument for why it would be necessary to suspend the person.
In the decision of the committee, it is stated that the tax investigator considered the man to have made materially incorrect tax statements for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He would have neglected his revenue from the sale of the Bitcoin for 27 million, either intentionally or by majestic dishonesty.
Punish the man for his highness.
He rejected it in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold electric coins for $27 million.
He would have purchased it in 2009 and 2010, when it would have been both easy and inexpensive with a regular home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold the electric coin, the tax transaction resulting from such a sale would have been substantially vague and unpredictable.
It could have been expected that ordinary citizens would be aware of such measures on tax transfers.
He had not intended to avoid paying taxes on the harvest and had made a statement of his property as a deposit on a currency account.
He had asked both acquaintances and the tax director how this would have been done, but without success.
Then he thought it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he started digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to introduce complex rules that the tax authorities would not have developed a clear view of.
The man thus found it right that his taxes for these two years of income would be recalculated and the burden applied but in other words no punishment was imposed.
Then he repeated that he lived in Iceland and had paid taxes here since 2012.
He had never intended to escape his duties in an unobedient way.
The claim for a fine would be out of place and would plunge him into debt.
He said, “This guy knows what football is.
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been numerous among the teeth of people but also aroused fascination for his progress in the outstanding time with Breiðablik in the Pepsi Max department.
Lightning will be on the line tonight as they receive the IA in a live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjolf then takes out the game ban due to four reminders during the season and therefore does not come to play with a new cut like in the Summer Games so far.
He had written “bla, bla, bla” on his arm for the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1–0.
“I don’t know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but when it comes to character, this one was better to try in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to match this game, I thought he would do it or create it,” said Gudmundur Benediktsson of Pepsi Max.
“I’m here for the people.”
Sometimes it’s hard to figure out what he’s in.
He looks a little out on the left side when it starts to feel on the game, but he has a very free roll in the team,” said Hjörvar Hafliðason.
Thorkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf is really entertaining and celebrates having such a colorful person in the division: “No one shares that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and to always be ready to meet and respond in interviews.
There are incredibly many people busy with him, who tell me that this guy understands what football is.
“I am a entertainer.
I want to be here for people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying in and watching what’s next on his hair.
“This guy is just a genius,” he said.
A player of KR says he wants to leave the club – “I’ve been in contact with several teams in the B division”
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to Bold, Tobias is ready to return to Denmark.
Football.net also about the case.
Tobias wants to start his season in his home country but for that he must first terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish league starts before the Icelandic league.
The company knows I miss Denmark and they have shown me a lot of understanding,” Tobias told Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with several teams in Division B and will probably change before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay for my contract with KR.”
Then he says he probably needs to take on a salary hike in Denmark.
“Companies in Denmark have probably felt more for the economic effects of the virus than in Iceland.”
Cyclist Bjartmar has recovered bicycles for millions - Answers now for themselves after DV review
For almost a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had interests unlike most others.
He brings up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bicycles and vessels.
Bjartmar has given himself the name “the cyclist”.
Yesterday there was a lot of confusion when one published a story of his contacts with Bjartmar.
DV then referred to a discussion on Facebook group of West Bengals where it was stated that Bjartmar had taken the man to talk in the East Bengal and said the West Bengal may be proud.
It was not possible to read from the original writings of the electrician other than that Bjartmar had stolen him.
These texts have now been modified on Facebook and the prefix of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartma says the initial news of the case does not describe what really happened yesterday in the East Coast.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victim of an electric shock that this was indeed his electric shock.
The information was received by the alleged owner from others, but the information proved to be false, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and looked at the driver, with information that there was an electric driver that had been missing for a very long time and was being sought.
I hesitated at first, but when I saw him preparing to take off on the bus, I decided to hesitate to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault and I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Overall, I’m doing very well in such a matter, but before I finished what I had to say, the man had taken away my word.”
Bjartmar says the man on the electric car had signed up and asked him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called the police.
“Yes, great,” said Bjartmar, “let’s just get it clean.”
So the owner of the electric car proved ownership of his electric car and went on.
Later, the right owner of the electric car told about his story on Facebook, like an analyst in the previous news.
During this roughly year that Bjartmar has devoted his time to this business, he says he can count the difference he landed on the sidelines with people on the fingers of one hand.
“I have had peaceful relationships with the most difficult people in Reykjavik,” Bjartmar said, suggesting that cyclist thieves are most often the youngest brothers and sisters of the community, addicts, mentally impaired people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“The addiction is a tough master and somehow needs to finance the next dose, unfortunately theft of such free funds is an easy way to that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is so good that I have brought a lot of good people with me.
Examples include people who went to treatment and took on and sought me and helped me with what I’m doing,” he says.
Generally speaking, Bjartmars communicates with cyclists on courteous nights.
Some know of him and what he is doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, number of bicycles, and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has little been addressed.
Furthermore, Bjartmar says that the police are also starting to point people to talk to him on the stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is incompatible with DV's previous news and says he is not a sort of automated police officer in a personal search for justice.
When asked whether he is still on the ice with his actions, and whether this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says it is.
“Of course the police have to do this, but the fact of the case is that the police are clearly not doing this.
I have to shoot watching the policemen drive away from a large bunch of stuck bikes.
She’s clearly blatant in these matters.”
“When the police are not doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category of cases, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in riding on stalled wheels that sometimes he finds his “expeditors” on the street that then they just got the Bjartmari wheels they had previously picked up.
The exchange that Bjartma has called for the help of the police has made it clear that she does not come.
“It just doesn’t work with the police, and it’s not me to teach, and it’s not the owners of bicycles to teach,” Bjartmar said and regrets that victims of bicycle theft have to feel for the emptiness of the police in this category of cases.
The results of Bjartmars are not shared.
You can find stories of people thanking Bjartmari for having reached their own back to them.
He says Bjartmar has long lost the number of bicycles he has returned, but the amounts rise, of course, in millions, if not millions.
Weigh there electric sweaters, electric bikes and electric scooters heavy, but an electric bike can cost under half a million.
Bjartmar works from day to day at the school and every other weekend he works at the school.
His cycling course is therefore an unpaid job he does in his free time.
Long shadows and long shadows
2019 was a big anniversary in Iceland’s history.
Officials were supposed to have been retired from Dankonung all the streets since the 19th century, but in 1919 an organic fund of officials was established which eventually became the organic fund of all public servants.
The foundations for the existing subsistence funds of ordinary workers were then laid by a general labour market agreement in 1969, which stipulated employment-related subsistence funds with compulsory allocation and full collection from the beginning of the 1970s.
In 1974, laws were established on the basis of these agreements and the biological risk system continued to strengthen after that.
The biological risk system of the wage workers was not the only radical change the 20th-century workers’ movement brought about with its nuclear warfare.
Unemployment benefits had been obtained in a similar way in the historic workshops of 1955, and the organizations also gradually received their demands on the right to illness and sickness allowance, substantial right to leave, shortened working hours, housing reforms and so on as much as a shift.
All these rights cost a great and harsh struggle but proved, according to some, to be a much greater and more lasting nuclear war than the proliferation of the auras in the wage sector, which disappeared evenly in the heat of the price boom that characterized the post-war period and up to 1990 as many remember.
The task of establishing the General Organic Reserve Fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
While people eventually agreed that the boats would actually be the property of associates, the trade union movement decided that their managers should be organised by representatives of employers and associates on an equal basis.
In the years following the establishment of the associations, the demand for a majority of the working people in the management of the associations was often discussed in the associations of wages, but it never succeeded, and therefore we still stand up with the unusual agreement that representatives of the associations are not in the majority in the management of the associations.
Article 36 of Law No. 129/1997 on compulsory insurance of livelihoods and the activities of livelihoods deals with the investment policy of the funds.
In the first chapter it is stated that “a livelihood fund shall have the interests of the associate in the light of the guidance.”
Also in the fifth chapter it says: “A life fund shall set its own ethical standards in investing.”
In the shareholder policy of the Livelihood Fund of Merchants there are, among other things, the following provisions, in continuation with the aforementioned legislative provisions:
The Reserve Fund is a party to the United Nations (UN PRI) Rules on Responsible Investment, along with many of the largest reserve funds and professional investors in the West and in Europe.
The regulations address how an emphasis on environmental and social issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improved investment returns in the securities market.
Thus, the interests of investors and the objectives of the national society in a wider context coincide.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, establish a public policy on:ining good governance, working conditions, social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Gildi Resource Fund, which has the largest assets in the country, has a “responsible investment policy” and has similar provisions.
This is all outlined here as an introduction to Iceland’s latest fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the matter, it is not expected that it has been defined to the point, but the following definition now seems to me to be “most adopted”: Shadow management is when a leader of a association says in the media that he intends to send the representatives of the association in the board of directors a recommendation or instruction on how to take a position in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the instructions, they will be removed from the management at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not report this in the media and does not talk about resignations, however, it is not “shadow management” since such interpersonal interactions, of course, are eternal in the financial world as elsewhere.
I let the reader think about which path he finds “shadier.”
There are two men who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
There are Heard Ægisson, a newspaper reporter, and Ásgeir Jónsson, head of the central bank.
The event was held after Bogi Nils Bogason, CEO of Icelandair, announced his intention to terminate the company’s contracts with aircraft freighters and aircraft operators (tell them up), and Ragnar Þór Ingólfsson, chairman of the Commercial Society of Reykjavik, then sent a recommendation to the company’s representatives under the management of the Commercial Association of Commercialists not to support a possible purchase of the company’s shares, if they were to be dismissed.
Some time later, Bogi Nils withdrew his decision, and then Ragnar Thor went the same way with his recommendations, which, of course, referred to Bog’s decision.
Nevertheless, they saw a reason for Hard and Asgeir to talk about the matter in Friday's Newspaper with big words about shadow management, crime and the rich need for changes in the law.
There was indeed a small straw that had to roll a heavy straw even though the blessed straw had been in the reception and had also been dried out quickly.
Since the matter is important, let’s consider the matter itself at the end.
I came up with the laws on organic funds that deal with this matter.
It implies that the board of directors must protect the interests of the associates and have ethical standards in investment, and these items are elaborated in detail in the agreements of both Gildis and the Foundation of Commercialists as I mentioned.
However, funds should NOT only look at short-term interest rates in their investments.
Such a strategy would be very dangerous, and it is not necessary to look long for such a case in the past, when large loans from banks and banks have resulted in unethical adventurers and environmental sanctions, with devastating consequences.
The CEO of Icelandair was obviously on the ice when he thought of dismissing an entire group of employees, significantly reducing the company’s well-being in the Icelandic market and weakening its position towards investors.
Fortunately, he noticed it and pulled it back.
The time will show whether it is sufficient for the investment of organic funds in the company to be considered liable to associates when it is made.

One of the infected persons did not have home access.
One of the three people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the East Atlantic on July 15, last year, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelandic who is not a resident here at normal age and has therefore not been given clear instructions to maintain the so-called return gate after arrival in the country and go to another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got a negative from the border.
“But he is in an Icelandic community and really should go to that resort,” said Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, an emergency care specialist at Landlökni and a local emergency care practitioner while he is on summer vacation, in an interview with Fréttabladet today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the subsequent exam.”
She says the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually resident abroad but because of his connections to the country as an Icelandic he would have preferred to use it Icelandic.
He did not realize this.
“When the student is not registered, you have to make sure to come to the second sample yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seemed to have realized that this was the right path,” says Kamilla.
“So it’s clear that we need to boost the information disclosure about this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system even though Icelanders don’t register their IDs.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system,” she explains.
Fortunately, the person concerned has little to do when he arrives in the country even though he is defined as a participant in the Icelandic community, being an Icelandic.
Only six have been sent into custody since he was identified yesterday, and those six were all with him.
They are going to take samples, but two of them are beginning to show signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sample at the border on July 15.
Camilla probably says that he had recently been infected with the virus that she was still unable to detect it when the sample was taken at the border.
She does not want to rule out that the man was infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus to the country.
“It’s not entirely possible to argue that this is an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of trouble in connection with the sporting competition.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how few people are here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” says Kamilla, but points out that it can’t be ruled out until Islamic genetics has classified the virus in humans.
"If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that it carried it to the country."
Pepper spray and bombs used against protesters
There were clashes between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used the protesters pepper spray and unscrupulous hand bombs, but the protesters broke rods and set fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racist condemnation were widespread in the United States last night, while protests in Seattle were in support of the protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, a demonstrator was shot dead.
According to the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands of people gathered in Seattle for peaceful demonstrations.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke rods in the city’s courthouse.
After that, police said the protest was unresolved and there was a clash between groups of protesters and police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police in August last year, was the most mentioned by protesters.
A car ran through a group of protesters in the city but none were injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black national guards gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and went in squads to closed street rallies where police arrested the group from a group of people protesting the protests and also carried firearms.
Then 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorated James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white barista in May.
Solskjaer: Not the game that defines our era
Ole Gunnar Solskjær, manager of Manchester United, does not want to make too much of the importance of today’s Leicester game in the final round of the English national team.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose against the Wolves, Solskjær and his men end in fifth place and lose from the Champions League seat.
Then they should still hope to get into the Champions League by winning the European Cup next month.
“We haven’t arrived at the meeting.
If we reach a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven’t had a bad time now,” Solskjær said.
"But whatever happens, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot in land with the two teams above us," Solskjær said.
Clearly, people’s nerves will be there at 3 p.m. today, but Solskjær tried to pretend that it was about any other game.
“If you want to be a member of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company is building on.
We’ve created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s up to us to take advantage of it,” Solskjær said.
“This is not the most important game of the season, this is just the next game.
You can ask anyone in football, the next game is always the most important one.
The ends do not define our era, we have already had many moments to define this period.”
“The arrival of Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I believe that overall we are in better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last season,” Solskjær said.
65,000 hits in the sun
65,490 new coronavirus cases were diagnosed in the United States yesterday, according to the John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the West Sea since the beginning of the catastrophe there in the country.
900 people died of the virus yesterday, but in the last four days before it, deaths from the virus were more than 1,000 per solar circle.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to the U.S. Department of Health, the number of deaths due to the virus is expected to reach 175,000 on August 15.
Fear of another wave
The Spanish government is now weakly trying to curb the increased spread of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There hasn’t been a single solar cycle since that in early May, and the rays are coming at the same time as the Spaniards begin to impose one of Europe’s toughest exit bans.
The backdrop resulted in the British authorities now obliging passengers coming from Spain to take a shuttle at their return.
A week ago, Spain was on Britain’s list of safe countries.
The situation is worse in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where the government has resorted to wider restrictions in an attempt to match the growth rate.
In the capital city of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and altars will be closed at midnight.
The ban is now in force for 200,000 inhabitants in the Segria district in the western part of Catalonia.
It is believed that Britain’s decision will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly played after the nightmare.
Tui, Britain’s largest travel agency, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the crisis, but there seems to be little interest in reaching back to a large-scale output chain that has widespreadly ruined the economy.
To shape, Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, has taken very badly on such and similar to nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
France’s prime minister, Jean Castex, said the nation “would not survive, economically or socially,” if a national exit ban was reinstated.
Hopefully many advisers believe that local resorts that reach the population of a particular town, town or region will be enough to keep the virus back in the next circle if it occurs.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three inland
Three domestic fighters were identified yesterday and two at the border.
Five people with Covid-19 infection were diagnosed in Iceland.
In a statement, the defense said one infection was linked to the infection yesterday at the ReyCUP football match.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were close to him in the shelter.
The infected was a participant in the social activity of a sports club in Reykjavik and is, according to the announcement, “only part of the sports team” in the registration.
Others who were sent in submissions relate to the person in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and the infection is in full progress by the infection team of the state regulator.
The counterparts of the ReyCUP have followed the guidelines and rules of prevention and public protection that are still in force and appropriate measures have been taken.
However, pictures of yesterday's tournament attracted attention as they could see in a very close concert to celebrate their team's good performance on the pitch.
Just before 11 p.m. today, the opponents posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
ATH: Parents, please respect the rules that competitors pick up their child at school.
Parents are not allowed to do that.
Thanks for your understanding.”
Another infection was diagnosed yesterday but is related to the infection last day.
“Iceland genetic testing has categorized the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before.”
The infection is dealt with in this case too and is the one infected in isolation and 12 in the hospital due to the infection.
The third issue is from a man who arrived in Iceland 11 days ago, on July 15.
He was located in the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in isolation and six who were in close association with him in a boat.
Two of them have already started showing symptoms of a virus.
In addition, two people were identified at the border and are awaiting the results of further investigations such as the mechanism of infection at the border.
Finally, the report says: The Department of Public Defense of the state regulator and the office of a land doctor urge people to be careful and careful about individual infectious agents.
Playing the least doubt about whether the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to go for a sample at the next health care facility.
Patreksfjörður says the tent area is booked for the shopping mall - Directing guests another
The park is closed for the weekend, according to the West Building.
Visitors are invited to look at other accommodation options.
Names Vesturbyggð Bíldudal, Tálknafjörd, Melanes på Rödasandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Breiðavík as other options in the station.
It is enough to be in Patreksfjord this weekend, because like last year, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic authors, will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and has thus become a strong tradition in the city.
From the appeal to the tent area to judge, we can expect a good arrival this year, if the weather does not take into account, but DV said earlier today from a derivative forecast.
We can still expect the worst weather on Sunday, and hope for Patreksfirden.
The website bb.is first, saying that all other accommodations in the city were already completed.
A whole cottage cave down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free on Dunhaga 18–20.
Meanwhile, owners are seeking building permits for repairs but their case has been in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive neighborhoods of Reykjavik, there is a roadside apartment building on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house there is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
Behind the house are the doors of two stairs, each containing four rather street apartments.
They are between 93 and 130 square meters, but most are over 100.
The house has a lot of history to store.
It was built in 1959 and has housed, among other things, a video store, the School Office, the milk store of the Milk House, the Joa gunhouse, a fish shop and now the University store.
The house has, as much as the weight is taken, remembered its stupid beauty.
The house is now under heavy damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
Owners of D18 e.g. are, according to the company register, Magnús Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus went for the ownership of Borgun and was a defender of the ownership society of Borgun.
In the group of owners of the property holding society of Borgunar is Steel Ship ehf.
Stálskip ehf. is the investment company of Gudrún Helgu Lárusdóttir and her children.
Godrún is also the owner of third-party shares in D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Augustus Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once performed the Steel Ship edition.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little that has beenined since then.
Tell neighbors that the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since, though mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of a neighborhood resident, one resident said the house was “not lively in the past year”.
There can play in that the owners have about a few years lost after changing the house and the plot.
Neighbors say the house has not been fine for a long time.
“It’s long time to do something right with this spot and it’s boring that it happened like this.”
He also says that he is overwhelmed by the owners of the house for not trying to finish this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house and ending this “legal mistake”.
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can rush into this and finish it.”
The “legal step” referred to by the resident is the organizational process of the circuit that has been ongoing since around 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 then applied for permission to build a floor above the existing multi-city building and behind the house, a new elevator and one-story reconstruction as well as a basement.
The building permit granted for that implementation was submitted to the Committee on Environment and Resources and revoked by the Committee as the implementation did not have a dispute basis and the neighborhood inspection was not satisfactory.
Reykjavik City then embarked on a parliamentary work and ended it with an announcement in the Government Times in July last year.
That arrangement was also adopted and the committee discontinued it in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house were on the starting line.
At that time, the house had collapsed significantly and the neighbors started to get tired.
When DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the reaction of the neighbors, the answers were different.
Some had an understanding of the owner’s intentions, others didn’t.
Others direct anger to the city, others not.
Others were just angry but not necessarily out on anyone.
Others said the parking lot was a fireplace, but neighbors have a new unlicensed parking lot Dunhaga 18–20 under their vehicles.
One man in the case said exhaustedly at the administration’s office:
“The fact that we have to go through the process in three phases is incredible.
It’s as if Reykjavik couldn’t read.”
Today, the house is empty, abandoned and disregarded.
A memorial of the city’s stealthy administration and the noble intentions of the owner and their many years of work that are now on their way to start.
When the journalist walked into the park at Dunhaga 18, a galloping door and garbage dump blasted at him.
Playstation computers and new TVs lay inside another trash on earth — a victim of Icelandic summer bleeding.
The door was opened into the old university prince’s office and there were numerous cats from the side to judge.
Clearly, someone has roamed around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stakes of sofas and beds and a few sheets of geographical journals, which should become a book, blasted.
The stairs of the apartment house were equally open and life in both.
The reporter was so lucky to encounter another resident of them.
The Russians were there cooking potatoes for dinner and inviting the journalist in.
The Romanians work for Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and the source DV warns that the company has paid nothing for the house except for heating and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it does not appear defensive to collect the rent.
From the position of the post office in the front door of the house to judge, it is clear that there has been a number of foreign workers living there in recent missions.
Employee rental operations have not been deterred by the Covid-19 situation, and a contraction in tourism has led to contractions in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most efficient to take advantage of employee rental services.
Nevertheless, the householders of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the working tables and the community’s assistants hanged up to three hours after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the poor condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be wellined.
When a journalist spoke to the boys in Romanian, the cold temperature suddenly became clear to him: at the best location in Reykjavik, 1,500 square meters of property stands down.
Owners want to change the house to repair and neighbors want to improve the situation but disagree on the definition of “repair”.
Between this, the city's structural area is at the beginning, the victim of endless appeal routes and the possibility of the planning process and the settlement phase of the Decision Committee on Environment and Resources.
There are Romanian workers living in the house, those who are going to improve the situation when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article originally appeared in the weekly DV on July 17.
In the fight against overweight in the aftermath of the coronavirus
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will allocate £10 million to a campaign against obesity, which will include a ban on early pregnancy advertisements, following his severe weakness, partly due to his weight.
Johnson is currently launching the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cycling for their overweight cyclists and will also be attacked in an effort to increase cycling.
Immediate advertising on television will be banned before 9 p.m., according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has alerted us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods,” a spokesman said.
Johnson himself has referred to a weight problem to struggle, but he was placed in custody when he was infected with the coronavirus in the spring, and is partly due to his weight because he is thought to have weakened so seriously.
Women are better at leading the change
She said the new constitution would be the biggest step a nation can take toward greater domination, transparency, anti-corruption and for the benefit of the general public.
“We need to change a little now and who is better suited to lead such a change than the group of society that has easier to stay in these values.
“There are women,” said Helga.
Women in Iceland are famous for their female status.
Stay together and lead change.
So now it’s up to us to lead those changes.”
She said she was a bit disgusting about the emphasis on Iceland as the “best in the world” in both gender rights and human rights.
“We are not ready to see what needs to be done.
As Germans are very aware of their history and look at everything that needs to be done.
It is a hill.
We need to know where we come from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the group’s voices.
We don’t have the same rules here,” Helga said.
Asked, she said women are in many ways in good affairs in Iceland but added that, like everywhere else, the construction of Icelanders has a magnificent masculine value.
She said that politics turned to shape its own interests, dominance and power that were the powers that sustained injustice in all societies.
“Women are now forming this group and coming together and are just a little upset that the Parliament is going to move forward and look beyond this 2012 referendum,” she said.
“These are the women’s values that we’re thinking about.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all really sitting at the same table,” she said, adding that the aforementioned values are the fundamental values of the new constitution.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people here who live in poverty.
It’s ridiculous, we can change things differently,” Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that there is a natural law that women’s jobs are always paid less.
It’s ridiculous that aviators and nurses have to stand endlessly in nuclear warfare just to get a humanitarian salary.”
The signature list for the new constitution can be signed here via electronic Iceland.
He tried to rob a pedestrian in the city centre.
A man was arrested in the city center last night after he threatened a pedestrian and tried to grab money from him.
Police also stopped drug production in Arabia, where two people were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of the motorcycle in the Hlíde, where the driver was at a speed of 146 km where the maximum speed is 60 km/h.
He had previously been deprived of his driver's license.
The police in the capital area had enough to turn in the night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five in the morning.
There was a lot of noise reporting because of compatibility.
On Saturday night, reports of eleven noisy collisions appeared in the police diary.
In the evening, 22 police officers were arrested.
Six were rescued in prison last night.
In the Arabian province, police were called at night when parties fired aircraft fire onto the air.
They had already escaped when a police officer came to the park.
Nine drivers were arrested for bullying and drug addiction.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city center last night, but one was saved in a prison cage.
Then two were taken to an emergency meeting after they fell on their faces, one in the center and the other in the west.
One was transported to an accident station after he injured by jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogi.
In addition, police stopped the driver who drove a motorcycle in the basement yesterday.
The vehicle was, according to the police journal, in “very bad condition” and was stationary.
You can stay in Monet's house for the shopkeeper's day.
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his life, is now available for rent on Airbnb.
The next free nights in the house are about the shopper's vacation.
The house is small and crisp, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The world famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two sitting rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet first got the inspiration to paint his gardens famous in this house.
If someone plans to rent the house, they will have to rent for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb, it’s next time it’s free in a week, on a shopping day Sunday, so it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to rush to book a painter’s house.
The two nights over the trade show cost only 964 U.S. dollars, or roughly 130 thousand Icelandic crowns, as soon as the Newspaper comes next.
Dozens of subjects and several of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five people have been diagnosed with the coronavirus within the last three days and most are unrelated.
Dozens have been hospitalized because of this and several of them are beginning to show symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were diagnosed with coronavirus at home yesterday and two at the border.
An expert at the Department of Agriculture says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading wider into the community.
“There’s been a classification from last year’s national crisis and it’s a virus that hasn’t been seen here before so we don’t have any special reason to think it has been hidden in the community for any time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very well guarded right now,” said Kamilla Sigríður Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of defence of the official pharmacist.
Most of those infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More samples will take place later than a few, which were in conjunction with those infected, are beginning to show symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza in progress and less about other respiratory infections so we can be quite free to do this test on individuals who at the time of influenza would have found a reason to do something else first,” said Kamilla.
The infection is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more will need to go to the hospital.
Two other infected people were identified after attending a sporting event.
It has raised questions about whether it is legitimate to hold such events.
The Communications Director of the Public Defense says it well slowly as long as people follow the standards and rules.
Camilla says it is almost excluded that the other infected have been infected during sports events.
“If there’s no more isolation from these individuals after we’ve met them at these sports, then we can assume that our defences at the tournament have worked.
But that’s not clear,” said Camilla.
The Department of Public Defence is under constant review.
“We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if there seems to be an opportunity,” Kamilla said.
Within a week, the crowd limit will be reached to 1,000 people.
This new location could have an impact on recommendations.
“Determined reflection to cook” – See Elisa Wears’ menu
Eliza Wearsdóttir is a football player and plays with Val.
She is also a master's degree in nutrition, a mother, and works as a food scientist.
She needs a lot of energy for the day and usually gives herself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My normal day begins with coming to work at eight o’clock,” says Elisha.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before bringing my girlfriend to school at three o’clock.”
Elisa finds it very nutritious to bring her daughter to school early.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to the second part.
After exercise, it’s good to get home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, it feels good for us to watch one show to calm our minds.”
Elisa does not follow a specific diet.
She is finishing a master's thesis in nutrition and knows well what to eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
“What is best for me is to eat a variety of foods that are well composed of protein, carbohydrates and fats.
However, I think the most important thing is to have a healthy relationship with food and not classify food into bad or good, rather nutritional or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not everything at once and not always.”
Elisa is very interested in cooking.
“I feel a certain reflection in standing in the kitchen to cook and suck in it a lot.
I have to say that my self-confidence is with me in the kitchen and I truly believe that I am a good cook.”
Breakfast: oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, let lie in breast milk overnight.
Eat this meal with everything you need.
Usually it is a banana and a jumped musli and coffee.
I am a great coffee maker.
Meanwhile: Incredibly mismatched, but fruits or vegetables, cakes, clean cakes with bananas and muslies, bread with additives and so I could eat hummus with a tablespoon out of the box if so.
Lunch: I often prepare all kinds of dining salads from what is available in the refrigerator, chinoos or builds, falafel balls, rock salads, baked vegetables with good dressing is a bit of what I’m working with.
If the arrangement goes completely out of the bands (which happens often), then the egg machine at work has brought me quite often to the rescue and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and soaked eggs, don't put more on you.
Meal: Give me some carbohydrate for exercise, bread with cloth, morning cereals or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will very often be the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of uprising following mass protests in the city center.
Police yesterday resorted to blasts and pipes to tempt to destroy a large area that demonstrators seized and spread across several blocks of houses near the city’s parliament.
Police announced on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into the damage carried out at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
Civil and police authorities say protesters struck police with bullets, bottles, bullets and other solvents, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
The protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
The blast was for them to show the protesters in Portland, Oregon consistency, but there in the city has repeatedly arisen to harsh clashes between the protesters and the heavily armed forces of the state.
There, like in more U.S. cities, people gather under the signs of Black Lives Matter, recalls Georges Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protesting systemic racism in the U.S. community and demanding correction.
Not withdrawn until after voting
It is still unclear whether the cancellations of Icelandair airlines, which are expected to take effect for the next month, will be revoked.
Electronic voting on Iceland’s air freight agreement ends tomorrow afternoon.
The company’s chairman, Gudlaug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, says he is confident that Icelandair will not take a decision on the dismissals until the outcome of the vote is made.
“It hangs closely together,” says Godlaug Linney.
“There have been no dismissals withdrawn, this must be done so that the machines can be managed.
So, of course, people are reluctant to know if there will be work after the month."
The deal was signed a week ago, on the 19th of July.
Gert is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that the airlines had previously voted on.
On 17 July, the Government and Confidentiality Board of Iceland’s Flugfrey Gesellschaft agreed to offer an all-military facility at Icelandair, the members approved it in a vote.
This was decided in the wake of Icelandair’s decision to discontinue talks with the Airline, terminate all its flights and seek agreements with another airline.
Then the company’s pilots had to take on the job of security officer on board temporarily.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Godlaug Linney is hard to say about it.
“People are in pain after this Icelandair move, when all the airline’s flights were cancelled and announced that it would be a contract with another airline.
Now we’ll see if it’s going to have an impact,” she says.
940 aircraft were employed by Icelandair at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were fired.
Their termination period is missing, for those with the shortest employment period it is three months and ends in the month of July-August.
About 90% of Icelandair airlines are in that group.
What happens if the contract is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing discussions with our partners.
With this agreement, we meet the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the aircraft has gone too far.”
Nuclear deal vote ends and Icelandair announces second quarter settlement tomorrow
The air freight vote on a new nuclear deal ends at 12 a.m. tomorrow.
Icelandair’s second quarter report will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary external results indicate that the company’s revenue has fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting on Icelandair’s Air Freedom and Employment Partnership nuclear agreement for Icelandair began on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, at 12 p.m.
Those entitled to vote for the agreement are Icelandair employees who pay social contributions to the Airline.
Icelandair and FFÍ signed a new nuclear deal on Sunday afternoon, July 19, but Icelandair had entered into talks with the airline on Friday after airlines carboned the previous deal in a vote in early July.
Icelandair had said all its aircraft and crews up on Friday but were withdrawn after a new nuclear deal was signed.
Under the new nuclear agreement, aircraft freelancers are required to fly five more hours a month for the same basic salary.
The nuclear agreement is valid until 2025, but it has integrated rules for pilots and aircraft freelancers on how long they can fly on a single guard.
The agreement was presented to FFI members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday and expressed dissatisfaction with the deal by many airlines with whom news agencies spoke.
However, most seemed to agree that it would have to accept the agreement to keep the FFI alive.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating performance for finance and tax, is, according to preliminary external results, negative about 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars, or about 15 billion SEK.
Icelandair submitted a press release to the Company on Wednesday, stating that the company’s revenue was approximately $60 million per quarter, or about SEK 8.3 billion.
Handheld funds and their equivalent amounted to about 154 million U.S. dollars at the end of the quarter, about 21 billion SEK.
Icelandair also plans to offer out the company’s shares in August.
Icelandair intends to terminate contracts with fifteen lenders, government and Boeing aircraft manufacturer by the end of the month before a tender will be launched.
A new sort rather than a new type of virus
“The new virus only means that it has been an individual who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been modeled here in the country,” says Már Kristjánsson, a doctor at the Infectious Diseases Department of the National Hospital, about the news that a “new type of virus” has been diagnosed here in the country.
Two on the border and three on the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in a social activity of a sports club at the Rey Cup football match but the origin of the infection is unknown and the infection continues.
The infection was also diagnosed in a person who arrived in the country on July 15 and two people who were with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Then yesterday an infection was diagnosed associated with an infection that was last day and after a classification by the Islamic Genetic Diagnosis revealed “a new type of virus that has not been diagnosed here before.”
The infection is completed in connection with the infection.
It is not a new virus, it is the same virus that has spread around the world, namely the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it means and if it could say anything about the beginning of another wave of aging, Már says that as if it is a short case to be discussed and it could go so that nothing else will come out of it.
“But if there are domestic cases that are not connected from abroad and have the same inheritance as this particular variety, then you could draw that conclusion [on the second wave] but it is untimely to support it,” explains Mar.
Happiness in the hot pot
Is the secret to happiness hidden in the hot pot?
BBC journalists lead a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that no place in the world has the same number of bathing sites per population.
The natural soil heat is the basis of it, but also the tradition for cooling that reigns here.
Child self-education was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are still able to use hot water for health purposes.
Sundreads are described as a fixed part of the general welfare of the country.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of steadyness and position.
Free from mobile phones, people talk together on a personal note about home and space or take advantage of the similar power of water: reflecting and charging the batteries of soul and body.
A hundred days for elections.
There are 100 days until the Americans go to elections and choose a president for four years.
Donald Trump is looking for a re-election, but he is still on the brink to pick up.
Joe Biden, a prospective Democratic candidate, has a big advantage over Trump at the national level, according to the polls.
According to a recent survey by the AP news agency, the majority of Americans think the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s reaction to the new coronavirus is also very unpleasant, and more Americans are counting than before the president had a bad attitude toward the economy.
Only two out of ten Americans say the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the catastrophe and 48 percent say he has held good on economic affairs.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirtyEight average, Biden’s followers are 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump’s followers are 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has sought to shift the attention from his performance towards the New Age to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural disputes and promoting policies that should turn to law and rule.
Biden’s proposal, however, plays a heavy race to keep attention to Trump and believes there’s a high probability of winning the ballot if the election is really about how Trump has stood in the past four years.
Trump’s hostility also seems to be going down on Republican lawmakers and fears Parliamentarians that Democrats could even gain a majority in the U.S. Senate elderly, which so far has been very competent.
Politico said in the days that the follow-up of classes and candidates was comparable and that it is now that the Republican Party would have its biggest defeat in a decade.
The outsourcing has been bad for the party in the 2016 parliamentary elections and it is now expected that this development will continue.
Trump has in recent days tried to intimidate suburban residents to follow him, among other things by saying that becoming President Biden, he will ruin the suburbs of the United States and push for racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has revoked the regulation from the time of Barack Obama at the White House, which was intended to increase diversity in outdoor areas.
He then urged a “houseman” of the U.S. suburb to read an article by a former New York deputy governor, in which she argued that Biden would destroy the U.S. suburbs and took Trump under it.
“Biden will ruin your neighborhood and the American Dream.
I will preserve it, and even make it even better!” the president said.
Residents of the U.S. suburbs are an ever-expanding group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitt Romney won the majority of votes from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Surveys have shown that even though Trump secured a narrow majority in the 2016 suburbs, his follow-up there has dropped significantly.
Although the polls vary, Biden has been estimated to have a fifteen percent advantage over Trump in television broadcasts lately.
Regis Philbin is dead
American television star Regis Philbin has died at the age of 88.
Philbin worked as an actor, co-director, presentor and singer for about six decades.
He is best known for directing Live! with Regis from 1988 to 2011 alongside Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
He has directed shows such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's Got Talent.
According to the Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most hours on American television and has earned recognition for that content.
He won six Emmy Awards and was nominated 37 times.
According to a statement from his family, Philbin died of natural causes.
Numerous colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him on social media the last solar cycle.
Will the Olympic Fire be the light at the end of the race?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only world wars have prompted until now, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic fire would be famously “the light at the end of the cycle,” possibly referring to the world age coronavirus that the world is now going through in unity.
Contractors have an additional year to prepare and the authorities in Japan pay for the costs due to the delay.
Everyone has a lot of heads.
When it was announced that Tokyo in Japan would be the venue of this year’s Olympic Games, the glory of the Japanese representatives was true.
They cried and laughed in turn, after Tokyo had applied for the 2016 Olympics, but that time it was downplayed by Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to catch the attention of the world.
The games were scheduled for July 24 to August 9, but have been postponed for a year to begin on July 23, 2021 and end on August 8, 2021.
If you fail to hold the games then, if the coronavirus still becomes too much threat, the games will be discontinued.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
The Olympics are not an ordinary sport.
Nothing to save, the show should always be magnificent and strive to top the last games.
The choice of a city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the selection committee on the promotions of the organizations.
The more spectacular the presentation is — the more likely you will get the knot.
Tokyo has saved $150 million in an attempt to host the 2016 Olympics, or an estimated $20 billion.
The second time, when the 2020 Games were applied, $75 million, about 10 billion SEK, was put into the promotion.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would host the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already allocated as a pupil 30 billion SEK to the project.
But that amount is only a drop in the sea in terms of how much it costs to build an Olympic village, a playground and generally strengthen the country’s infrastructure to host such a tournament, prepare it and hold the games themselves.
Organizers in Japan have said the Tokyo Olympics, which should have been held these days but has been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report by a government auditor in Japan released at the end of last year stated that the cost would be almost twice that number.
It is unlikely that it will be possible to fully estimate the cost of postponing the games, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore range from $15 billion to $30 billion.
The figures are so high that all the Icelandic state's tax revenues accounted for only about half of the Olympic Games, with the lowest possible cost.
The Olympic Games are events of such a magnitude that they have become the subject of consideration of economists, who try to dig into numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, a lot of people seem to have come to the conclusion that the effects of the Olympics are less than so positive for the economies of those who hold them.
Short-term effects are any, for example, numerous jobs very much for a short time, but for a longer period of time cities prefer to sit up with debt levels and threatening operating costs of little-used structures.
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, sits up with substantial debt due to the 2016 Games and has been in trouble with the cost ofining all the major athletic facilities built before the Games.
There has been an increase in numbers since the 2012 London Olympics, but it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who received employment related to the Olympics in the city were unemployed before.
That means it was not about talking about a new job except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not been successful financially in hosting the Olympics due to the sluggish costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
The benefit, however, is likely to lie in the increased traffic of tourists who wish to visit the Olympic cities in the aftermath of the Games, which, however, is highly uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It is also unclear whether it will be able to accommodate all the audience that usually downloads the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that the cities seem to be dominated by, but it is difficult to value as a wealth.
Therefore, despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the pleasure that the games bring is not of the nature that it can be valued.
But although the show is important and there is no way to save, it is of course not just about money.
They are the athletes who are at the forefront.
For some entrepreneurs, it is surprising to just welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-degree winner and gold prize winner in her article at the recent Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is cashless and would have been far from good in the summer but hopes to be in competitive shape for the 2021 Games.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just rather pleased with the temptation, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who planned to quit after the Games this year, if they had been held at the right time, the temptation of the games in some cases means that they end the race before the games take place.
Trust your body simply not to go through years in addition to strict exercises.
Few athletes were as successful in the hearts of the audience at the 2016 Rio Olympics as the film star Simone Biles.
She came home with four golds on her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in his home country, the United States, recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is planning for the 2021 Olympics, but she is not sure if she will still be at the top of the next year, when she will be 24 years old.
Although it is not generally considered a high age, it is in a higher rank for a female actress in the front row.
“This is a sensitive issue,” says Biles, but smiles at another interview posted on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page, asking if she intends to reach the same length at the 2021 Games as she did in Rio 2016.
“I honestly don’t know if I’ll still be at the top after a whole year in addition to training,” says Biles.
She has previously said that her body does not tolerate the strain that accompanies fitness training much longer.
She is currently training for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop practicing when the World War II was at its peak and the cinema hall was closed.
No exceptions were for Biles rather than others while all athletic facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympics could not buy any access beyond the other, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
The basic form is better than most people.
“We have a plan right now.
It was hard to start exercising again after the movie theatre opened.
We started slowly, but we are getting to a full pace and I will increase my exercises steadily and steadily as the year goes on.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice given that they will be, we can’t do anything else.
I’ve put too much effort into leaving the sport now,” says Biles.
With it, like others, the eve is closed, or the awareness that the situation may arise that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Predicting it is hopeless.
No one can know what the status quo of the world’s Crown Age will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do than prepare for the Olympic Games given that they will be held every year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid courses.
Wedding cancelled due to disaster
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was scheduled to marry former Bachelorette competitor Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about now,” the actress said in an interview with People.
“We definitely want to get married someday and have the dream wedding and have all the presences that are dear to us.
But we decided to hit it on time and focus on what’s important now and that’s to help share information about the importance of being with masks and staying at home.
I’m looking more at the world than the wedding stuff these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what’s going on in the world.”
