It's dangerous to drive in a high heeled car!
Accidents are more common when young people step on the wrong pedal ((Auto Messe Web)) - Yahoo! news
Violation of the Road Traffic Act.
While there is increasing attention being paid to reports of accidents caused by mismanagement, such as pedal step errors, it is a big mistake to think that it is only a problem for older drivers.
In the number of pedal-stepping mishaps by age (data from the Police Department for 2015), the highest age was 1080 under the age of 24 and the highest 1032 over the age of 75.
Mistakes are never more common in older people, and it is important to draw attention to younger generations equally.
Can I get a foot shadow?
Do you take the safety off?
The data do not include a gender ratio or cause-and-effect relationship, but unlike older adults, who are thought to be more likely to be affected by physical decline, such as driving skills and reflexology, younger people may also be thought to be affected by foot errors due to distractions such as music or conversation, or by foot mistakes due to clothing.
Especially women, some people choose high heels, pumps, sandals, mules and, depending on the clothes of the day, different shoes and drive just like that.
While some people are uncomfortable wearing a new one, knowing that it is not suitable for driving, many others drive without any thought of the potential danger involved and with no ill will.
However, driving in high heels and sandals is contrary to road traffic laws.
One is "to operate the handlebars, brakes and other operations with certainty" and Article 70 "Violation of the duty to drive safely", which states "Do not drive in a manner that causes an accident or causes harm to persons".
And another is Article 71 "Public Safety Compliance Compliance Violation", which states that drivers must comply with the requirements set by the Public Safety Commission of each prefecture, for example, the regulations for the implementation of the Miyazaki Prefectural Road Traffic Law, Article 12, contain a sentence that "wearing shoes that may impede driving operations, or not driving vehicles (except light vehicles) in a manner that impedes driving operations, or wearing shoes that may impede driving operations".
The same purpose is served by each prefecture-level capital, which considers driving with "footwear that may impede driving operations" to be an offence even if it is not explicitly marked as high heels.
So why is it dangerous to drive in high heels?
That's clear given the basics of safely operating the pedal.
For safe and reliable pedal operation, first fix your heel to the floor, place your foot so that it is vertical to the brake pedal, and when stepping on the axle pedal, lean your foot to the right as a support point there.
At this point, it becomes important to secure the hook firmly so that it does not break, regardless of the car's behavior.
However, in high heels, the area of the foot landing on the floor is small, always blending with the glugra, and because the heel height is angled to the entire foot, the area of the foot landing on the pedal is also small, making it difficult to firmly step, making fine adjustments difficult.
This can be considered to lead to danger.
Also, most cars have floor mats, but this material can easily catch the heel heel, or it can get stuck in the heel and the pedal can't step on it during emergency braking, or it can slip off the heel and get caught behind the pedal and not be able to step on it when the heel is caught.
In addition, there are cases where the heel pulls on the back of the pedal when stepping on the pedal and then returning it, and the axle pedal stops returning.

President Moon welcomed Bulgaria's policy of granting Korean companies the status of "strategic investors", and said he hoped that this would be used to promote investment by Korean companies in Bulgaria.
He also stressed that South Korea could be an ideal partner for Bulgaria in promoting the introduction of nuclear power plants and the modernization of the defense sector, and called for interest and cooperation to enable Korean companies to participate in the Bulgarian government's nuclear power plant bidding and the promotion of the defense industry.

The military warehouse and the island's local industry, the "salt-stone" manufacturing firm recently filed for bankruptcy, owed about 2 billion yen to the Imperial Data Bank.
The sluggish housing market and repeated earthquake damage also affected the progress of "consumer rooftop isolation".
Near Ceramics (shares) (TDB corporate code: 530173983 首本:99.2万円 兵庫県淡路市大谷881-8,代表福原幸蔵さん,従業員44名) has filed for bankruptcy on its own behalf with the Kobe District Court on August 30.

Our company, founded in June 1895 (Meiji 28), is a brick manufacturer that was reorganized into a legal entity in April 1961 (Showa 36).
It originally started its business as a brick manufacturer, a field industry on the island of Taiwan, in the town of Sasechi, Sasechi Prefecture, under the trademark of "Kino" (株).
In October 1986, the merger of the merged and merged cooperative and the business of the nearby industrial company was taken over, and at the same time, the company changed its name and moved its headquarters to its current location.
Later, it became the current system by opening sales offices in Fukuoka City, Hiroshima City, Daishō City, Miyazaki City, etc., where previously the main product was wood ash, but due to changing consumer needs now wood ash such as flat stone is produced at a rate of 70%, wood ash such as flat stone and wood ash at a rate of 30%.
It has built a broad sales base in the center of western Japan, including major housebuilders, building materials trading companies, roofing contractors, and others; in December 2004, it recorded annual sales of about 3.16 billion yen.
It had a well-deserved reputation as one of the top clay producers on the Pacific Islands.
However, the sluggish housing market since the Lehman shock and the repeated earthquake damage from the Great East Japan Earthquake and the Kumamoto earthquake, among others, have led to increased demand for roofing materials, and annual sales in December 2018 fell to about 1.345 billion yen.
On the revenue side, in addition to falling profit margins due to higher fuel prices, it was forced to undertake a stringent capital raising, running a continuous deficit with excessive dividend liabilities associated with stock loads and equipment investments.
Because of this, despite attempts to rebuild the business, including requesting easing of loan repayment conditions from financial institutions, gradual funding was forced to begin without any sign of recovery in the business situation.
Unable to support coming here, I gave up continuing the business, which became this step.
The debt is currently under investigation but is expected to be around 2 billion yen.
The Prefectural Dinosaur Museum in the city of Shizuoka, Fukui Prefecture, which promotes the "industrialization of tourism" ((Japanese aerial photography and small drone drone photography))
The city of Zhenzhan, Fukui Prefecture, announced on September 25 its policy to acquire about 25,300 square meters of land adjacent to the construction site of the station "Dinosaur Valley Kabum" on the road that will open next spring.

Darvish summed up this season as "the turning point in my life ever". (東スポWeb) - Yahoo! news
St. Louis, Missouri 27th ((Japanese time 28 days) is starting
With the playoff prospects gone, and the Cubs' Darvish-bound pitcher who finished the season on the board, 33 , told an interview about his current state of mind, "I haven't done anything for about two days, just watching baseball from the bench with no purpose".
He's started 31 games this season, with six wins, eight losses and a .398 save percentage, but has thrown 178 2/3 innings and taken 229 three-pointers.
Especially in the second half, the bowling form was stable, and the tremendous control and ball power continued to outmaneuver the opponents with overwhelming balls.
"It's definitely a different time in my life now.At 33, I never thought I'd feel like this.In the spring I thought, 'I might end up like this too,' but coming back from there and being in a better position, I feel incredible even in a full season".
From around the beginning of June I was gradually able to get a handle on the response.
"Every day I was able to do more, one day at a time".
There were trial and error, but challenging one hypothesis after another led to a higher status in the hierarchy and, with it, better grades.
"Tossed without being on the injured list for a year" also led to confidence.
Darvish, who has the right to opt out of his contract after the end of the season, said he "will have to think about it from now on; I'll talk to my agent, I'll talk to my family", but added that he "basically has no complaints about this team and it's fun".
I haven't come to the final conclusion, but my feelings seem to be solidifying.

Measures are underway at the post office, which suffered a total power outage following the Chilcheng East earthquake last September, and the water outage at a city apartment building.
According to the city's Enterprise Bureau and Water and Sewerage Department, in the year following the earthquake, seven apartment buildings installed "discharge taps" that can drain water even in the event of a power outage.
There are about 400 apartments and private housing units in the city with more than four floors that are supplied with water by "reservoir" systems that may cut off water during a power outage, and the department is calling for consideration of measures.
Residential water supply systems are broadly divided into two types: "reservoir system", which sends water directly to the basement and rooftop receptacles, and "direct connection", which supplies water directly to the doors from the city's water supply pipes.
The receiving tank type is one where, even if the water pipe is not damaged, the electric pumps that pump water from the receiving tank to the doors will not work due to power outages, etc. The water supply will not be able to be provided, the doors will cut off the water.

This is a painful, fast-paced story of a yakuza who has no eye for social contribution, the chairman of the Agif group who takes over the reconstruction of a high school on the verge of bankruptcy, and solves numerous problems with his in-laws.
Westy is played by Sidada, a strong-faced but somewhat hateful group leader, and Yakumo, the No. 2 in the group of Agipbo, who is always being turned around.
West Island has a lot of emotion on its first day as it "has been tense all day until today".
"Not only during filming, but also after filming, this member was a very tight-knit team, getting together often, talking about things, and they were a very close-knit team", he says.
Ito also laughed, saying, "There was a 'reflection meeting,' just a drinking party where there was no reflection at all", and revealed that he had spent precious time, saying, "That time was made, and it was a plus on the set, too.
In the story of the drinking party, West Island's unexpected nudity was also revealed.
Wishiyama confesses that "when I was in a meditation session with this member, I drank too much; I often don't remember half of it".
Sidada "looked so confused, I don't know", she cut it off, "Looks like a sirap, but was he drunk?

Following the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, discussions on ongoing test operations in the fisheries off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, and discussions on full-scale operations by region, etc., became a concrete policy.

The union's board also approved the formal addition of the exports of the eels, sacklamuses and murasoi off the coast of Fukushima Prefecture, where the export restriction instructions have been lifted, to the fish species subject to the test operations.
The remaining non-catch fishery was made up of two fish species, the beanosgay and the comoncasbe.
After the end, Chairman Nozomi, speaking to reporters, stressed that the start date of full operations was uncertain.
Regarding the treatment water after the purification of contaminated water from the Fukushima I nuclear power plant, he said, "A cranky debate is a problem.Our position against ocean releases will not change". and rebuffed comments by the former environment minister Hiroyuki Hirata and Osaka city mayor Matsui Irohi.
In discussing the basic operation, the head of the Jiaokawa chapter of the Yao City Fisheries Association noted that "it is necessary to absorb opinions from below" and that the intentions of the union members would be respected.
It is to convene a council of the umbrella branches, resolve each of the problems before it, and then draw conclusions as the municipal fisheries council.
The head of the Limousine Union of the SAMA Bipartisan Fisheries Association, Liogyi Remouchi, said, "We need to discuss this with fishermen and also with the intermediaries".
The SAMA BIOFISHERY COUNCIL, which has received state support and is due to receive seven newly built vessels next year, said, "It is important to restore the catch first", and expressed the idea of moving forward with environmental improvements in parallel with discussions on full-scale operations.

"Beauty and the Beast" is a paperweight?
The image of the "snake" repeated to the beauties in his artwork is Magmix - Yahoo! news
What do mysterious beauty and the expression of shadows have in common?
The 図かずお美少女コレクション (玄光社) focusing on the beautiful girls drawn by Mr. 図かずお, who has been releasing numerous works since the 1950s and is known as the first person of the "horror manga", was launched in August 2019.
When I take it in my hands and look at it, I am once again struck by the correlation between "beauty" and "terror" in your work.
Is it because there is a "shadow" that it is attractive?
 drawings of your work's beautiful girls ((5 pieces) 
Even the preface to the Beauty Girls Collection had a sentence that said, "Their beauty stands out because of the contrast between horror and ugliness, shocking scenes and unfolding of the story, but perhaps it is because of the contrast between the beautiful faces that are distorted, the resentment turned into a hateful expression that is more "terrible".
While the keyword "serpent" is a common feature in his artwork, snakes are perceived by the viewer as "scary creatures" and "beautiful" in different ways.
There are people in the world who like reptiles, and there are those who are just plain lazy.
Thus, depending on the senses of the viewer, the creature behind the "beauty" and "ugliness" may be a "serpent".
This creature is also revered as a creature with higher spiritual powers than in the past, and houses inhabited by the "white snake" are said to bring good luck.
His illustrations of the "snake" include "Snake Girl" and "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" from the 1965 "Mommy's a Tramp!" series.
Most often, the "herb woman" is the beautiful woman with the shadow.
If I can say it in a tongue-in-cheek way, can I say it's the "cool beauty" type ... ... that feels like the beauties in the artwork have in common.
Anyway, the main character of 'Orochi', which has been serialized in 'Weekly Youth Sunday' since 1969, 'Orochi' is a beautiful young woman character who is the epitome of the artwork, but the fact that she falls into a deep sleep every hundred years to maintain eternal life and eternal youth, and the part with mysterious powers, reminds me of a 'snake' somewhere.

There is a 1.6-fold increase compared to 2018, and there are 24 in Fukui Prefecture, up from nine last year.
Why is it a children's dining room now?
▼NPO Corporation chairman and social activist Tōmasasekō Ōsaka spoke about the background and meaning of the conference held in Sakai City.
The boy's ageing makes the neighborhood lonely, and the shopping street declines.
People no longer had a place to meet.
There, "a regional exchange hub was sought where people would mingle with each other".
▼ Although it is a children's cafeteria, it is a "multi-generational exchange space" in which the elderly also participate.
Not only will it eliminate orphan hunger, but it will also lead to child-rearing support and healthier older adults.
It will break the chains of poverty and revitalize the community.
The important thing is "not to have kids that start from there".
▼Various places from 1st of the month to a daily meal.
The scale ranges from a few to hundreds of people, and the venues vary widely, from private homes to temples.
There is an atmosphere that is becoming where people who want to do it can do it.
The low cost of such a property is charming.
It's just that it's difficult to secure operating and staffing costs.
We also hear about challenges such as a secure management system.
"With many people, values change", "Connecting with society becomes a safety net in case of disaster, etc"., says Tōu Asō.
It seems like a light of hope in a closed society.

"Nike" will launch eight new models of the Air Force 1 that has been popular as the brand's signature sneaker since its launch in 1982.

The "real culprit" in the drone attack on Saudi oil facilities (Friday)
"The Iranian-made drone 'Ababir' used in the bombing has seen a dramatic performance improvement in recent years by analyzing a downed U.S. military drone.
It can be produced inexpensively, and the range is about 1000km.
It's so low in the sky, it's hard to get caught by radar". - Yokota Tsuchi, reporter cameraman
On September 14, the oil facilities of Saudi Arabia's largest oil company Saudi Aramco were bombed by 10 military drones.
Shortly after this, Yemen's Houthi opposition group issued a statement committing the crime.
"The one behind the Houthis is undoubtedly Iran, led by President Rouhani.Iran cannot allow its adversary Saudi Arabia to profit from crude oil in a situation where its own country cannot export crude oil.The aim is to make the international community aware that the continuation of the crude oil embargo against Iran will entail corresponding pain". - Mr. 原出, international political analyst
In the wake of the bombing, half of Saudi Arabia's entire oil production stopped and crude oil prices soared by 15%.
With this being the case, there are rumors that oil shocks are coming again.
"As Trump pledges to withdraw US troops from the Middle East, at least until after next year's election, he wants to avoid military intervention at all costs.It is understood that Iran will continue to bomb drones to cover the Houthis.But the US cannot tolerate it forever.There is a good chance that Trump will decide to attack Iran from now on".

The reason why a super-personalized YouTuber became a full-time employee.
Ask the president who hired you.
9/27 (金) 8:47 broadcast 
YouTuber who is now immensely popular among young people.
While it is not uncommon for companies to hire YouTubers to advertise their products, some companies have started an unusual mechanism called "YouTuber Recruitment" where they hire YouTubers as full-time employees in their company.
The company's main business is corporate CRM (customer relationship management) and is the direct marketing mix (DmMiX).
What does "hiring a YouTuber" actually mean?
I spoke to Mr. Rin Yuki, who is the representative director of DmMiX and this time, the representative of the subsidiary staff first, where the YouTuber was actually hired.
I want to support young people who are struggling with YouTuber recruitment.
― How does "YouTuber hiring" work in the first place?
小林祐樹 (以下 小林): Now the profession of YouTuber has become the dream of many young people.
Primary school students are also at the top of the career rankings they want to pursue in the future, and more and more young people will continue to aspire to it in the future.
So far, our company has been recruiting and supporting young people who are pursuing their dreams of being bandmen, comedians and more.
Similarly, "YouTuber Recruitment" is about hiring and supporting young people who are pursuing their dreams of becoming a YouTuber.
― There is an image of YouTuber as an individual who posts videos on his own, but why did you consider "hiring" him?
小林: While many young people aspire to a career as a YouTuber, the reality is that most YouTubers don't make the income they thought they would.
There are a lot of creators who are making and posting videos while working, and there are also creators whose families can't accept the existence of YouTuber.
The initiative provides an environment for salaries and content production for hired creators.
We hope to support Demerit, a professional YouTuber who will initially find himself in an unstable position, by supporting his activities with our company.

"South Korea wants to return to GSOMIA" US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Trade and Industry - Yahoo! news
Responding to a one-on-one interview with SUNNAB on the 27th at the US Ambassador's residence in the capital, Deputy US Assistant Secretary of State for Korea-Japan, Napper said that "we hope that South Korea will reconsider its decision to cancel and come back" on the Gsomia military information protection agreement, which expires on November 23.
It is unusual for U.S. officials to refer to the GSOMIA scrapping review.
GSOMIA is the basis for the signing of agreements between Japan, the United States and the Republic of Korea, respectively, and the sharing of missile launch information.
South Korea announced in August that it would terminate the agreement with Japan, and if it expires, the framework for protecting military information in Japan would collapse.
Napper claims that "without GSOMIA, we cannot respond effectively to the crisis".
"There is time until expiration" strongly urged the return of South Korea.
He also expressed a threat perception of the "first time in history" that the joint flight exercise conducted by the North Korean Navy in July over Japanese waters was also a threat, and claimed that "the U.S. and South Korea, which share values such as democracy and human rights, are indispensable to continue to work together in alliance relations".
He noted that yesterday's deterioration in Japan-Korea relations "would harm the national interests of the United States".
"There is no intention to mediate", he said, adding that "Japan and South Korea will play a positive role in helping to fill the gap".

Mr. Zonda, who lives in the city and says he was "surprised by the depth of compassion of those around me that I can see for the first time".
What caught my attention was the legend of the city of Ozawa "The face of the ghost of the bride".
To the ghostly mother-in-law, whose face has been removed, the story of a kindly bride who continues to chant meditation to help her mother-in-law, not caring that she is surprised at her face.
"Forget hate, return with kindness and tenderness.I felt the core of the confidence and tenderness of the Fukui people". (Sōtōda さん) 
Taking inspiration from her, Ms. Tōda completed the story "Memo and Ghost" featuring a couple of kind-hearted ghosts and a boy, with interviews leading up to the original picture book, her early arrival at the Kizaki Mito in Ozawa City, and more.

Sales of large appliances before the tax increase are doing well, big camera sales in front of the store in Okamas Station.
On the 28th, the last weekend before the consumption tax increase from 8% to 10%, home electricity wholesalers and supermarkets in Okinawa prefecture were visited by family members of rush purchasers.
There are also home centers that have special outlets for exclusive purchases, and suit shops that sell winter clothing upside down, each of which is also trying to sell.
At the Big Camera Okinawa Station Shop (Okamoto City North Station Station) they are launching a sale that has launched a limited special price for a period of up to 30 days.
A businessman from the same city who came to the store looking for a refrigerator, a male, said, "Not 2% but I can't miss the difference when it comes to the expensive stuff".
According to the store, major appliances such as televisions, washing machines, refrigerators and other household appliances grew in September, and sales were about twice as high as the previous year.
"The demand for entry is beyond imagination.In the second half of the year, customers will be noticeable looking for high-end products".
The sale marked "Big deal just before the tax increase" is being conducted by suit sales is now a business.
The coat has been on sale since early September, a month earlier than usual, and this month's sales are up 10% from last year.
A male employee who visited a warehouse store (白楽町, Warehouse City) to buy a suit for adults is "too early for the ceremony, but I want to buy it before the tax increase".
As the current tax increase will keep the tax rate on beverages, foodstuffs and other items in a reduced tax rate system, home centers and supermarkets will be limited to appeal to everyday goods and alcohol.
In the Time Tower store in the Home Center (Okayama City Center and base), a special corner with a large capacity of detergents and tissues is deployed near the entrance.
Sales of daily consumables increased 1.6 times from the same month last year, "If you don't replenish it several times a day, you'll cut it off" (Shinki Shintoki, store manager).
A male civil servant from the same city who came to the store, 63 was packing up kitchen paper for the occasion, "because I'm going to buy it anyway".
The Okannan store (which is also in the same city's southern district) will also set up a wagon loaded with detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, etc. at the event site.
A male employee from the same city (35) said that "if you receive a cashless payment point refund, the amount of the charge will hardly change, so you never rush to buy daily necessities".
The best director of 2019 is Crop, the "best director" who honors the greatest enemy general (SPORT.es) - Yahoo! news
Jurgen Klopp, who won the Best Director award for 'The Best', looks back at his career in an interview and also comments on the current situation.
Among many statements that shocked the public was one about Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, who was his biggest rival in the fight for the Premier League title.
Neymar's best friend Aubes says "his happiness is still at Barcelona"...
After the award ceremony for 'The Best', the German commander claims that "I never imagined anything so wonderful.I am very satisfied and proud to have won this award.It was a wonderful few days for me.It was thanks to my players that I was able to win it.The most important thing is the team".
Regarding Guardiola, Klopp said, "I have a lot of respect for him", "What can I say about him? he has won many titles. his team's style of play is exceptional. he is the best manager I have ever faced, and it is an honor to have been nominated and to have been able to compete for an award with him".
He also mentions the managers, Pochettino and Tottenham.
"His last year was incredibly great.In many cases, if he didn't win the title, he wouldn't be remembered by people.He was building a team little by little, playing in a great style".
Klopp never misses the best moment of 2019: " (CL) is a reversal in the Barcelona game. many experts and I myself would not have bet an inch on us. 3-0 back-to-back against a team that owns Messi and Suarez . . . it's like a death sentence. we had a small chance. we could have made it. I couldn't believe it. looking back, I might say we controlled CL in this game. this game will be remembered by everyone".
Finally, when asked a more personal question, Kropp concluded: "When I was celebrating the Bundesliga victory, I woke up on a bench and didn't even know where I was. This time, nothing like that happened. I'm a person who is plagued by compulsive ideas of self-management, so I don't like to get drunk. The CL triumph blessing was so modest. I remember everything. If I had lined everyone in front of me, I might be able to tell everyone I saw from the bus".
LexusLC and IS have a special specification car that invests in them from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology (WEB CARTOP) - Yahoo! news
Finished in a special 1 machine that enhances even more style and flavor.
Lexus has set a special specification for the luxury coupe "LC" and sports sedan "IS", which will be launched on October 1st.
The interior of the LexusLC stands out in high quality photos.
The special specification car was developed based on the idea of "CRAFTED".
CRAFTED embodies the Japanese sense of beauty, cultivated in the midst of rich nature and history, and the desire to wander the mind of the person with their sense of perception of the ambiguous, seeking it without words, using every means from craftsmanship to cutting-edge technology, to create new, heart-wrenching experiences.
The LC's special specification car "PATINA Elegance" is based on the LC500/LC500h, adopting Lexus's highest quality leather L-ANILINE sheets, which combine softness and naturalness while providing durability, and a leather steering using a soft hand-held premium laser.
I finished as a model that further elevated the style and taste.
L-ANILINE has strictly selected only the highest quality raw leather, and achieves softness with a colour coat aimed at thin coatings through a long-term malleable process and unique technology.
The body-wrapping sitting position and the feeling of fitness while walking upwards.
Steering is also based on the use of premium lasers, and the high quality is felt on the skin.
In addition, it was specially equipped with arcade ceilings, metalworking with laser etching, a beautifully floating scaffolding with overlapping L-motifs, and a color head-up display.
The interior adopts a combination of bright patina brown for special specification cars and bright brown colors matched to the door trim, leather seat, seat belt and seat belt.
Also, the stitch colors utilize two shades of light brown and dark brown of different brightness, combining with a catchy texture, to represent a high quality and deep space.
The body color is a special specification car-only setup with a three-color setup of trailer chemimetrics, sonic titanium, graphite black glass flakes and more.
I'd like to use the sidecar.
According to Apple, the new macOS Catalina, which will also begin distribution in mid-October, is available.
The exact date has not been revealed, but it could be on October 4th.
 see full image  macOS Catalina's release date may be October 4th?
The image above was originally published on the Apple site in Denmark (now corrected).
The image certainly has the text "from October 4th ((from the 4th of October)) " ね。
On the official website, the information is also highly accurate.
By the way, personally, the feature I'd most like to try with macOS Catalina is "Sidecar" ▽
This is a feature that treats the iPad as a sub-display of the Mac, a feature that was traditionally implemented by a third-party app.
And since Sidecar is a purely Apple-owned feature, it is expected to excel in more completeness (and responsiveness).
There are also rumors of the next MacBook Pro with a 16-inch display, but first I want to experience this next generation macOS in real time.
The growth process of sakuraebi in Shizuoka City, etc. PT, water depth290 meters photographed by the Shizuoka newspaper Ates
This year's Sakurabe, who succeeded in shooting in the deep sea of the Ōno Bay, Ōhara Oasis in Shizuoka City's clean water district (the "Bissakabe Project provided")
The "Bissakabi Project" of the Marine Industry Cluster Council by nurseries, including the city of Shizuoka, has so far successfully photographed the nurseries, which are believed to have been born during the spring-summer spawning season of this year, at a depth of 290 meters on the seabed of the Ōu River Bay.
The footage of the growing process is valuable, and those involved want to link it to the ecological solution of the mysterious saccharomyces.
The photo was taken near the seabed about 1⁄5 kilometers off the coast of the city's freshwater area of Harajuku.
In 17 minutes, I've confirmed about 300 of them.
The traditional notion that deep-sea seagulls during the day are "on the seabed, forming a certain degree of swarming" was reaffirmed.
The adult body is about 40 mm long, the one shown is about 23 mm long.
The matching of seasonally-specific data of water-fried sackcloths was used to determine the spawning season.
Detailed analysis will be commissioned by the Fujifilm Software Technologies and Shizuoka Industrial and Technical University, which make up the team.
Project leader Hideyoshi Hideyoshi says she "wants to capture the life-like appearance of the individual in the process of growth, including the infant".

While the roofs are covered in blue sheets and some facilities are undergoing renovations, half of the restaurants have been forced to reopen.
Mr. Satsuki Kenji, 34, a company member from Samagura City who visited with his family, said with a smile, "I was worried about when it would reopen.

bad olympic race first half battle world king 桃田賢斗, well-formed weekday becoming a step ahead!
< Men's singles>(Bad X Spi!
The Japanese team, which won six medals at the Big Event of Badminton, the 25th World Championships (Switzerland, Basel) held in August, will compete in the China Open (Standard State/Super1000) starting on the 17th, after completing their strengthening meet in early September.
Here, while looking back at the first half of the Games from May to August, when the Games began, which marked the start of next year's Tokyo Olympics, we look forward to the men's singles in the middle of the games (September to December).
The Olympic Badminton race, which began in May, has consumed 4 events, the top tournament in which the top players compete (above the Super500) at the time of the World Championships' end.
The only two who kept up a good run in the first half were Tomita Kensuke, who won two of the four events, and Chow Tianchen of Taiwan.
Tomita won the World Championships, Zhoutaing won the Indonesia OP ((S1000) and the tournament where she could earn high points in the "world ranking points" that directly linked to the Olympic race.
桃田 has also manufactured other Japanese OP (((S750) ▽
The competition that has been competing since May is the group Siddimann Cup ((May/China)) 、 Indonesia OP ((July/results 16 strong)) 、 Japan OP ((July)) 、 World Championship (August)).
Although the numbers are small compared to other top players, it is a schedule that has kept the load on the body down.
Just because August was only one World Championship event, it wouldn't be more exhausting than during the war.
Good results in the midfield games, where the top league has been in continuous contention since September, are desired.
Taiwan's ace is strong enough to fight the war itself.
Watch out for the young Thai too!
Zhou, who also won the top tournaments at the Indonesia OP and the TaiP (S500), has already competed in seven tournaments.
She also competed in the September local Taipei OP ((S300)) and won the overall title.
Physically strong by nature, and a player who doesn't even struggle to fight.
Even if the convention continues, there will be no major problem with the performance of the match.
Rather, having been able to score high points in the first half would have made it easier to adjust the schedule of the next tournament.
Zhong Wencheng was under the impression of being explosive until last year, but with a more stable playing surface this year, he was able to continue his solid performances.
For world No. 1 Peacheda, it looks like he'll be a more difficult opponent than ever.
Apart from these two players, the results in the first half were left by Thai youth ace Cantaphon and India's Sai Puranis B. 。
And three players from Anders Antonssen, who are fighting alone as a European power.
Although Cantofone have not qualified for the final in the top league, they are still in a position to win the top spot, including being in the best four in the top two leagues this season.
There is still a rough edge, but the 20-year-old who has been able to rally on a par with top players (21 on the 18th) seems to have great potential to make a leap in the Olympic race.
Also, Sai Puranis B. has taken a step out of India's lineup of good singles players.
Samir Barama, Planoy H.S. and Srikans Kidambi, who are also lagging behind with injuries, will also be chasing in the future, but India's post-midfield strength needs to be kept in mind.
New tariffs for mobile phones fair competition to lower prices: Hokkaido newspaper 如何信電子版
New tariff plans for mobile phone companies have been announced in connection with the entry into force of the Telecommunications Business Act amended in October.
But, for the most part, it has come to a halt.
The head of the State Department, Nguyen Thi Kim, said last summer that "there is room for a 40% cut" and that despite rising expectations of price cuts, there was no price competition.
The intrinsic participation of KMT was delayed, and the continued monopoly of the big 3 companies was a big factor.
It is desirable that a tariff system be easy to use, with fair competition for consumers.
I want to ask for the efforts of mobile phone companies.
The amended law prohibits set discounts on terminal and communications charges.
Instead of selling the terminal at a discount, the communication charges were set to be discounted.
SoftBank and KDDI announced plans to make the terminal the largest and most affordable.
But both companies have a mechanism for "SIM lock" on the terminal, which prevents the other company's line from being used for 100 days.
NTT Dokomomo will only cover the subscribers of its own lines with a maximum of one-third of the terminal cost.
All three companies appear to be continuing their "encirclement" to prevent switching to others.
Regarding SIM lock, the Prime Minister's Department has indicated a policy of mandating immediate lifting.
Businesses also need to respond quickly.
The delay was due to the fact that the construction of the communications network, including the base station, did not go as planned.
It's a shoulder-shrugging attitude, just as it was hoped that the price cut would be a trigger for competition.
Was there a sweetness to look through?
The start date and fees of the service have not been disclosed.
As a company that carries out social infrastructure, I want you to take responsibility for your business.
The tariff adjustment was prompted by comments by the Office of the Secretary of State.
Mr. Liu expressed dissatisfaction with the new tariffs of the three companies, saying, "I think competition is going to start now.
But "official price cuts" do not seem to distort the market or promote healthy competition.
Businesses should develop customer-based competition before they are booed by governments.
The fee systems of the various companies are very complex and not easy to compare.
Despite the fact that the terminal advertises such things as "the maximum will be half the price", the Consumer Agency has called attention to cases where the burden on consumers exceeds half the price.
Companies themselves must ensure that polite and understandable explanations are given so as not to cause misunderstandings among users.
The withdrawal limit has been lowered to 500,000 yen cash card in Shichong Prefecture - 伊勢新聞
Three credit bureaus in Tsuga Prefecture (San-named Triple Credit Bureaus; North Ise Upshino Credit Bureaus; and Tsuga-shi Credit Bureaus) announced on the 26th that they had decided to lower the cash card withdrawal limit to prevent the casualties of special fraud.
For depositors over 70 years of age who hold cash cards from various credit vaults in San Nam-tsigong, North Ise-nago, and Tsigikokyo and have not made a withdrawal transaction of more than a certain amount at an ATM in the past 3 years, the maximum amount that can be withdrawn per day with a cash card is 500,000 yen.
The San Nam Triple Trust Fund and the North Isekai Shikoku Trust Fund will implement the reduction from October 1st, and the Tsube Trust Fund will implement the reduction from November 1st.
In the prefecture, there have been a number of special cases of fraud involving cash card and PIN numbers fraud, which involves financial institutions, police officials and others, and ATM withdrawals, and the officials of the credit union said they "want to protect your precious deposits in the best possible way".

Rugby World Cup  One-shot retirement and brawl overseas waves of "insulting and despicable play" over US player's "face dangerous tackle" (The Answer) - Yahoo! news 
USFL Quill is a rough play, former England international "not something you can call a tackle"
Rugby World Cup (W Cup) Japan 26th, last appearance by the last of the 20 countries that participated USA lost 7-45 to England.
Black Star has been developing, but in the second half, the rough play played by FL John Quill is calling waves.
A one-off withdrawal in a form that adds a shoulder-tackle to the opponent's face.
The actual scene was published by foreign media with video, and the former England international also complained of "insulting and despicable play" and "nothing that could be called a tackle".
"Unspectable and despicable play" with overseas waves!
A retreat, a commotion in which both armies' players are entering... the actual moment of the "face dangerous tackle" performed by US representative Quill.
The passionate struggle has crossed a line.
It's 29th minute of the second half after leading 0-38 and 0-0.
Deep in the opponent's line, England's general Farrell was slightly off balance as he caught a side pass.
The one who went to tackle this was Quill.
Just, instead of from the waist down, I woke up my upper body and hit my upper half of the body hard.
The result is a form of head-to-head contact, in which the opponent's head appears to be in contact with the other's head.
The phareel was violently blown off, and fell over.
England's player has been protesting against a clear lack of legitimacy in his play when he tried to push a quill.
The two army players gathered together, and the air of instantaneous fire became a single breath.
As a result of the TMO (video judgment), Quill was sent off with a red card.
He left the pitch with a bad-looking butt, but some of the audience demanding fair play also heard a booing.
The local New Zealand media "staff", rugby's powerhouse, featured the headline "Rugby World Cup 2019: US players out for mean play, England quick win".
"Kill pulled out after making a despicable shoulder charge on England star player Farrell's face", reports the Daily Mail, "It almost became a brawl between the two teams".
In the article, the former England international introduces comments by commentator Hugo Monja.
He complained that the game was "insulting, mean, nothing you could call a tackle, mean play".
The United States, who were one man down in the match, somehow escaped a complete loss in the 81st minute with a home try.
However, the quail's play left a bad taste in the aftermath.
The Ministry of Health and Labour on September 26 published for the first time the names of 424 hospitals among 1,455 public hospitals nationwide and public hospitals such as Nipedae, which it judged to have "poor clinical performance".
Within Fukuoka Prefecture, the Ministry of Labor and Labour reviewed the treatment performance of 14 public and public hospitals and evaluated 4 facilities in the ▽あわら市国立病院機構▽坂井市三国病院▽越前市織田病院▽高浜市若狭高浜病院.
⇒ The four hospitals subject to restructuring are "out of standard".
In order to curb the aging and inflating healthcare costs, the need to promote reorganization and integration with hospitals in competing regions, led to exceptional response.
In October, the hospital was asked to seriously consider reorganizing and integrating the hospital and to conclude by September next year.
There is no enforcement, but the concern that a nearby hospital will be lost is expected to lead to backlash from local chiefs and residents.
The announcement was made at a meeting on the same day.
Hospitals accounted for 29.1% of the total, with relatively few hospitals with a high number of beds.
In other cities, the percentage was higher in the following order: 新 ((53.7%) 北海道 ((486.6%) 宮城 ((47.5%) 山口 ((46.7%) 岡山 ((43.3%) ).
The number of subjects was highest at 54 in Hokkaido, while Okinawa was the only zero.
Based on 2017 data, the Department of Labor surveyed 1,455 hospitals, public and private, that cater to "highly acute" patients and "acute" general surgery patients.
The clinical performance of nine items, including cancer and emergency care, and whether competing hospitals are located "within 20 minutes' drive" were analyzed, and the need for hospital names to be published was determined.
The hospital concerned may consider the abolition or transfer of some clinical departments to other hospitals.
Health care costs will skyrocket in the next 25 years, when the entire cluster generation will be over 75.
For this reason, the Ministry of Labour has set a target of reducing the number of hospital beds with 1,246,000 beds in 18 years to 1,191,000 beds nationwide.
Currently, while nurses are well-positioned and the number of "highly acute" and "acute" beds is high, which is expensive, there is a lack of high-need rehabilitation for the elderly.
To address ageing, not only do we need to reduce the number of beds, but we also need to increase the number of beds for rehabilitation.
Regarding the reorganization and integration of hospitals, each capital prefecture has developed a "regional health plan" that sets out the number of beds needed over the next 25 years, among other things.
Although the country is being discussed by municipalities and health officials to be divided into 339 zones, many local residents and chiefs have maintained a cautious stance and the debate is stalled.
The Ministry of Labour wants to link this to the activation of the debate by publishing the names of hospitals with poor performance.
駒ケ岳 volcano predicted, road and other comprehensive training in disaster prevention  residents' participation in the area, 18 years first time 動画) : 北海道新聞 どうしん電子版
A comprehensive disaster prevention exercise that envisaged the eruption of the 1131-meter-high 駒ケ岳 was held on September 27 in the forest, Itai, and Kagome townships of the Ferry Channel.
About 400 people, including staff and residents of 20 institutions, including the Tao and 3 towns, participated.
It was the first time the Hokkaido Kome Kyu Volcano Disaster Management Council has held the event since it drafted an evacuation plan that included residents' evacuation routes in August.
The extensive training in which residents participate is the first in 18 years.
At 8:45 a.m., it is assumed that the Kome Keyu erupted, and mudslides reached the town of Yamasaki.
When the volcano alert level was raised to 5 (evacuation), shelters were opened in both Forest and Seiichi towns, and residents moved in buses and traffic police vehicles provided by the towns.
100,000 students protest climate change in Vancouver, where schools are closed and students are demanding warming measures (Everybody's Economic News Network) - Yahoo! news
About 100,000 citizens, centred on students who sympathized with 16-year-old environmental activist Greta Thunberg, marched in the city of Vancouver on September 27 to demand action on climate change.
This is a picture of a climate demonstration in Vancouver.
The march took place from Vancouver City Hall across Camby Bridge to the downtown library.
People with placards began to gather in front of the town hall at the gathering place hours before the start, and at 1 p.m. at the start time, there were enough people to fill the streets a few blocks ahead of town hall.
The number of participants continued to grow after that, eventually reaching over 100,000 people.
On the road along the way, the police also cooperated in enforcing traffic regulations, keeping watch for several hours until everyone had finished walking.
In conjunction with the UN Climate Action Summit in New York, the city of Vancouver has been hosting a number of events focusing on warming since last weekend.
On the 27th day of the last day, a school strike was held under the slogan "Fridays for Future".
Students who took a break from school on this day appealed to adults that 'even when they take a break from the important thing called school, they want to protect the planet' and many adults who took a break from work were seen to respond that 'we will also do our best for the future of children who are seriously studying'.
Pig cholera vaccine recommended area9 prefectures Ministry of Agriculture and Water (https://www.gifnews.com) - Yahoo! news
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries on 27th published a revised draft of the prevention guidelines that allows preventive vaccination of currently unauthorized farmed pigs to prevent the spread of infectious disease "porcine cholera" in livestock.
The target area is the policy to select nine prefectures, including Gifu and Aichi Prefecture, where infections in pigs and wild boar have been confirmed.
Movements of vaccinated live pigs and fertilized eggs are restricted within the territory, but the movement of semen and processed products outside the territory is allowed.
Through public comments to the general public, etc., we aim to complete the procedure in mid-October at the earliest.
By allowing the use of vaccines and the out-of-region circulation of meat, such as semen, the country may not be a "clean country" that has been recognized by international organizations and may affect pork exports.
Since the September incident last year, Japan's clean-up status was in a state of temporary reserve.
The amendment states that, based on the expert opinion of areas at high risk of infection from wild boar to pigs, the Ministry of Agriculture and Water establishes "recommended vaccination areas".
The relevant prefecture of the capital will create a "vaccination program" that includes the scope and timing of vaccinations, the number of vaccinations, the way in which they are carried out, and will be approved by the province and authorized for use at the discretion of the governor.
The other seven prefectures listed as recommended areas for vaccination are 玉, Fuyshan, Ishikawa, Fukuchi, Longnō, Three-Score, and Shiga.
When the guidelines are revised, the region will assess the situation and re-decide.
Movements of vaccinated pigs, semen, fertilized eggs, carcasses, excrement, etc. are, in principle, restricted within the territory.
For minced meat and processed products, it does not cover the costs of restricting distribution or the impact on farmers, and in fact allows distribution outside the territory.
To prevent the spread of the virus, food waste will be thoroughly disposed of.
We also work to appeal the safety of vaccinated pigs and to prevent reputational damage.
The draft amendments to the guidelines were discussed at an expert conference held on the same day and confirmed at a meeting of the Epidemic Prevention and Control Headquarters.
From now on, opinion-reading and public comments on the prefecture of Toho will be conducted until October 7, and new guidelines for epidemic prevention will be implemented.
No affiliation with 本田圭佑, open approach to the MANU!
"Please make an offer.No money is needed". (football channel) - Yahoo! news
9/28 (Tu) 2:57 provided 
The Australian A-League side Melbourne Victory were relegated last season and now-unattached former Japan international MF Guyu Honda made a surprising move.
動画本田圭佑, was he actually in the match?
The truth of heaven will be revealed.
Updating his own Twitter account at midnight on the 27th, Japanese time, Honda made an open approach to a club, saying, "Please make an offer.
The opponent who sent the "counter-offer" was, in fact, the world-famous Manchester United.
Why did Honda make such a grand request to a Premier League club?
The inspiration for this story comes from an article in the Australian edition of FOX Sports published on the 24th.
In an article titled "5 FWs Manchester United are likely to grab in the midst of an injury-plagued run-off crisis", five currently available unattached players were picked up.
Among the players such as Hatem Ben Alfa, Giuseppe Rossi, Wilfred Bonny, and others, Honda's name was also mentioned.
At the moment, United are in a state of emergency with MF Paul Pogba, DFRuk Shaw, DF Eric Bailey, FW Anthony Marshall, FW Marcus Rashford and others continuing to have injuries.
The "Red Devils" led by coach Ole Gunnar Sursal face challenges in frontline quality as they are forced to endure 2 wins, 22 losses and a bitter slide in the league play-offs.
So it was Honda that the state media named as the new force candidate for the takeo shutout.
The article analyzed that "Honda's contract as a player of the creative side, not a striker strictly speaking, could fill the hole that Andreas Pereira is filling".
Whilst scoring nine goals in 18 appearances for Melbourne Victory is a "solid record", it has also been pointed out that "the 33-year-old Honda needs to take a break from his entertainment of managing the Cambodian national team and concentrate fully".
But is Honda's approach really working?
For the veteran whose Tokyo Olympics appearance next year will be a goal and a public address, we are also watching United move on.
500 mobile translators have been installed in the beaches free loan to the beaches, shops, etc.
The mobile translator "PocketTalk" is being lent free of charge to 500 shops, including stores in the city of Hamamatsu.
The Hamamatsu Chamber of Commerce announced on the 26th that in its business of free lending of mobile translators "PocketTalk" to member businesses, it has completed the installation of 500 units in stores in Hamamatsu city and others.
It will be noted whether the deployment of the same translator in a concentrated area in the same region is a national first, leading to an increase in inbound (visiting travellers) responsiveness.
貸与先的內訳 is restaurant236、 retail store113、 accommodation 17、 and others 134、
The same city centre area occupies 60% of the city.
It also started showing the pre-lending to the Google Maps map app, making it possible to see the location of "foreign language-enabled stores" on your smartphone.
It can be accessed from the site of the beach and lake tourism zone etc.
The free lending of PocketTalk, which supports 74 languages, was an initiative launched in April by nine organizations in the city that received the declaration of "Japan's first inbound support city 浜松".
The chamber will lend for two years to small and medium-sized businesses that meet the conditions of purchasing 500 units, obtaining hospitality certification, introducing cashless payments, etc.
The chamber's official said it "wants to be linked to the development of new foreign customers in a tough business environment".
Now the famous direct-drama 池村寛世 is not even a tip for 1 shot?
Mr. Cady's best shot of the day
A 1W shot is not necessarily a tip-up shot.
There is also a technique called "straight draw" - hitting the ball on the ground when you want to gain distance with the second hit of the par-5 or something else.
The recent 1W also has a large head volume and the risk of scattering the ball, but there are players who practice this frequently on the teeing ground as well.
The tour's first win is expected to be for Ikimura Ryohide.
The 24-year-old, in his seventh year of pro, is 166cm tall and small-handed, but is currently seventh in the driving distance division ((average 304.02yd)) 。
While I was willing to take a long shot, one of the challenges was fairwaywood accuracy.
Early in the spring, my shot of "Spoon" (3W) failed, so I thought I'd try a straight draw.
From the practice round onwards, you can drop the ball and potty on the grass in the tea area or swing 1W at the same time.
Although tip-ups are more commonly used in cases where big carries are required, both sides have made good use of straight draw in narrow halls and so on.
"It can be used in any hall where the gaze is cast down".
The ballistic trajectory meter recorded 270yd280yd in the carriage.
"That's why I don't need 3W.Cady also said that she'd be more comfortable with a straight draw than a 3W ... "
From the "Japan Tour Championship" in June, Wood is only 1W in the cuddly bag.
The 2nd longest club is the loft 17-degree UT.
The tactics, which are also admired by fellow tourists, are pleasing to the ears of admiration that leak from the gallery I saw.
The trick is to "shake the club to a level" or "shake the club to a level".
"Down blow, up hit, no straight fly; cut track, go right".I was originally playing straight draw to make a 1W swing correction during the tip-up.This practice also loosens the attack angle of the club.
The ball is not caught, there is a risk of slice but "so I can remove the left side (not bend to the left) " 。
I tell Kanton but... and, it's a professional skill that I don't think about.

The means of transportation is all skateboards!
I've been haunted since I started skiing at the invitation of friends.
I'm still a beginner, but it feels good to push through the asphalt.
The Filson hunting jacket is convenient because it can be used to carry a smartphone, wallet or luggage, and it can be used hands-free.
It's also nice to feel the wind blowing directly in the shoots.
And of course, the feet, lightly covered in a pair of convertible skateboarders.
Fashion and culture around Skyebo are also cool so I'll be checking magazines and Insta regularly!
The haircut also started to attend the salon run by a skater beautician at Yuyutan Temple.
I'm encouraged and inspired by the way they teach me tricks I still can't do, or information about skate parks, etc.
After school, it's part of our day to walk the streets with friends and skateboarders.

Greta Thunberg poses a question on Twitter, "Why do adults make fun of and threaten children?"
Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg made her speech on September 23 at the UN Climate Action Summit in New York.
While the speech has received attention, there have been messages that appear to insult Greta.
Greta Thunberg tweeted "Why do adults make fun of and threaten children?"
A political commentator commented on an American TV show that Greta was "mentally ill. being used by her parents and the international left".
Even in Japan, there have been many online comments about Greta, such as "used and misused" and "you should go to school" and comments on parts of Greta's statement that are not in the content.
Meanwhile, on September 26, Greta posted on her Twitter account, "Why do adults spend their time teasing and bullying teenagers and children?"
"I come up with every conceivable lie and conspiracy theory".
Greta began her post with, "Look, it's starting again.As you can see, the people who hate me are just as active.They're chasing me around, chasing my looks, my clothes, my attitude, and where I'm different from other people.They're coming up with as many lies and conspiracy theories as they can think of".
And pointing out that adults seem to be shifting the conversation's topic because they don't want to face the climate and environmental crisis, he continued:
Why adults spend their time teasing and threatening teenagers and children, I honestly don't understand.
You'll be able to do another good one at that time.
I think they feel threatened by us.
But don't waste your time paying attention to them anymore.
The world is beginning to wake up.
Change is coming.
Whether or not adults like the change.
See you on Friday, on the road!
On Friday the 20th of the previous week, strikes on climate change were held all over the world, including New York.
Ms. Greta had called for Friday the 27th to be held as well.

Garcia's wedge shot is a good one.
I thought I could go with that momentum in the second half, because I was able to stretch the first half to the extent that I was, but I was disappointed because I couldn't stretch the pattern quite well and I was disappointed.
Did you see the winner on the 6th Eagle, the 7th Birdie?
After I hit the bogey at No. 4, I still had a par-5 left, so if I was doing it with a vengeance, the Chip In Eagle came at No. 6.
We had a chance to get the birdie in the 7th, but I was disappointed that we couldn't extend it in the second half.
- What did you get from this convention?
The recent (shot) was not in good shape, so it was good that the fairway was able to hold on to the narrow track.
Since the course was so different from the other, with both the raft and the reverse, and the strokes and distances changing, I had no experience and was quite busy.
- What's the difference from a regular convention?
(Smartphone, etc.) where it was possible to shoot a camera, right?
I didn't care at all, but the people at the gallery were making videos and stuff.
Other than that, there wasn't much different, but just because the co-host was a tournament with fewer Japanese players, I went into the game with the feeling that "I can't lose to overseas players".
The second half will continue from now on, but I want to mention one more win because if I don't win more than one, I can't aim for the prize king, and there is a ZOZO Championship nearby, so I will try hard to get to the top of the conference and qualify for the playoffs.
What are the ways to prevent dementia and keep it at a "forgetfulness" level?
取材・文/渡辺陽 (What is going on) 
The dementia drug that is being frustrated by major pharmaceutical companies and university hospitals challenging research and development and frustrating the development of dementia drugs.
However, the link between dementia and lifestyle habits is being elucidated, and it has been found that it may be extremely mild and even be able to be limited to the level of forgetfulness.
I heard a talk from Professor Da-jun Jun-woo at the nearby University Hospital and Stroke Center.
Dementia will not go away.
― A prevention of dementia, or a treatment, is expected, but what is the status quo?‖
From mild to severe, no matter the degree, anyone can develop dementia as they age.
However, it is thought that it will still take more than 20 years for new dementia drugs to be developed.
A drug commonly used in Japan, donepezil, is also already out of insurance in some overseas countries, and no noticeable curative effect is expected.
On the other hand, deaths from infections and accidents have decreased, and cancer deaths have also decreased with the tremendous progress in treatments such as anti-cancer drugs, which have allowed people to live longer.
Therefore, it is also true that there is an increase in dementia patients.
It is not something that can be solved by individuals or families alone, but rather society as a whole must continue to create an environment in which the region can live in safety and security.
How to keep things to the "forgotten" level
― Are there people who are prone to dementia, or are there people who are difficult to get?‖
Even if the development of major dementia is inevitable, it is possible to keep symptoms as low as possible and to keep it at a "forgetfulness" level.
Dementia is considered one of the lifestyle disorders and tends to be more prone to those who are susceptible.
First, people who are heavy on metabolism are more likely to develop dementia.
Dementia is considered one of the lifestyle disorders.
It is a combination of obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and haemorrhoids.
Whether or not economic power will have an impact.
For example, in the United States, there are areas that distribute food stamps called food stamps to the poor, but the foods that can be obtained with food stamps are preserved frozen hamburgers, pizza, and chicken.
It can be used by people who live in an environment where they cannot use gas or electricity or cook in the first place.
Then, they will be reduced to a diet low in vegetables and protein and lead a life based on fat and sugar.
Eventually, poverty becomes fatness, and the body becomes unfree, with nothing to do but watch TV.
A similar situation may be possible in Japan.
Others, who don't think about things or work, are also more prone to dementia.
In other words, to prevent dementia, you need to stop being a metabolic, read a book every day and think about things.

Jaguar F-PACE, the first major upgrade to the...hybridization possibility also ((response)) - Yahoo! news
Jaguar's first crossoverSUV, the improved new prototype of the F-PACE, was captured by a camera for the first time in southern Europe.
The F-PACE is the origin of the four-seater concept SUV 'C-X17' which was first unveiled in 2013.
Then in 2014 a 5-seater version was released, officially debuting as "F-PACE" at the 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show.
The following year, 2016, the first generation of the current model will be launched, this time with the first facelift.
The captured prototype, although covered in a thick camouflage, shows some of the new design.
The headlights appear to be more compact and thinly designed, and the side air intake appears to have been modified to a sporty elliptical shape.
