The total spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) spread in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK increased rapidly from 1 January to 15 March 2020
Similar trends are being observed in the overall prevalence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, while the global COVID-19 outbreak is increasing at different stages in all countries depending on the country.
Based on the experience of Italy, hospitals and intensive care units of several countries should increase their preparedness due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients as they will require care, especially intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, a large number of cases of unknown-cause pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent is novel coronavirus now known as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
However, the disease that results from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
There is evidence to date that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild respiratory infection, with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
About 14% of cases occur in the case of more serious illness, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of cases require intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we will assess trends in the overall spread of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK and compare them with Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the recent number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread further geographically, and the dynamic state of the global COVID-19 outbreak in the rest of the world is currently aligned with that country.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of EuroVigilance, Spretary et al reported the first European-confirmed COVID-19 cases as defined by WHO.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were reported by three French people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on 24 January 2020.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported from 31 December 2019 to date, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Gathering the total data of COVID-19 cases and overall spread
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) receives COVID-19 case data in every country worldwide only from official sources, the Ministries of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization updated daily at 8:00 am.
The data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to Italy.
As a spread of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day total spread of COVID-19 in the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020 taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK.
We presented aggregate data of reported cases from each country as of 8:00 am on 15 March 2020, compared to Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
In general, the 14-day total spread of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK is in line with Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall COVID-19 outbreak began to rise around 21 February and then accelerated to 28 February 2020 (content).
This was largely due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the overall spread of COVID-19 in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK has shown similar increasing trends.
In Figure 2, the total number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy, during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020, is shown.
It highlighted that, as of 8am on 15 March, just 3 weeks ago or less, the total number of cases reported in the EU/EEA and the UK was 15 times higher than in Italy.
Our findings indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the overall spread of COVID-19 indicate that the global pandemic is increasing at a comparative rate across all countries.
Despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in national public health responses and different protocols for the possible identification of cases and patient selection in countries must be tested to confirm COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
In early March 2020, doctors from affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas have already reached their maximum capacity.
Currently, data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to any hospital and/or intensive care unit for %6 and %1 cases respectively at EU/EEA level are available (statistics not shown).
However, recent surveillance data, including the number of reported cases and deaths, should be collected in an orderly manner.
A 2010-11 study showed that there was a significant change in the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe from 29.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany and 4.2 per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that these countries will have resources like Italy at least (11 in 2010 had 12.5 beds of intensive care and intermediate care per 100,000 population).
Modelling scenarios for healthcare capacity enhancement, estimates of COVID-19 hospitalized cases in each EU/EEA country and the UK associated with a risk of exceeding > 90% of the ICU bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC's acute concern assessment on COVID-19.
As there are so far cases swarms in EU/EEA countries and specific areas of the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units in general define the regional region's population, the priority data on cases and intensive care beds 2 (NUTS-2) provide a numbering facility available to regional units.
Current trends from Italy and other countries show that the global COVID-19 outbreak is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for a permanent community outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and the rise in COVID-19 cases, like those in Italy, requires health care in particular, especially intensive care.
As the recent ECDC Rapid Concern Assessment, a fast, active and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2 has been identified as essential, which should be accompanied by a change in the mitigation approach to prevention, if not implemented early, the expected rapid increase in the number of cases will not provide sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, recognize and adapt to their response.
The acute risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic.
There is a small opportunity where countries are likely to step up their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on healthcare providers.
Failing this, it is likely that healthcare providers in EU/EEA countries will face the need for intensive care due to the increase in patients in the coming days or weeks.
The most severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), caused by the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has so far caused over 3,000 deaths and over 80,000 people worldwide, resulting in catastrophic human consequences.
Like its homologous virus SARS-Cov, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also spread through the skin and cause similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS but it affects older people more than young people and women more than men.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive overview of a rapidly developing research paper.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, virology, epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us understand and combat this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival of 25 January 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memorial for all Chinese due to the novel viral outbreak urging them to stay home for all holidays and weeks.
It is highly homologous with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS). Thus, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and its associated disease is named COVID-19.
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread to almost 50 other countries around the country and the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 40,000 patients recovering and 3,000 deaths.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is "people's number one enemy" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, causes, treatment and diagnosis since its first report on 7 January 2020 and which has determined multiple patients to be isolated.
The review seeks to summarize the creative developments in the new and fast-growing field of subject matter.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and another COVID, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We'll talk about what we've learned so far about diagnosis and prevention, as well as some important questions that remain.
CoV has traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, primarily causing about 15% of the common 4 cases.
However, in this century, we have two highly lethal CoVs, SARS CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the epidemic in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon the terrible disease spread to many other countries with its mortality rate.
So the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of COVID-19 in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1,1, pneumonia strains with unknown origins were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the COVID configuration was released.
The first fatality occurred in Wuhan on January 15, 2020.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, healthcare workers were reported infected, which meant it could be transmitted from person to person.
On January 23, it was shut down by shutting down all public transport in Wuhan city.
The first clinical study on the disease on January 24 reported that only 21 of the 41 confirmed cases had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site of the onset of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
By the time this report was published, the disease had already spread throughout China and to some 50 countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation is accelerating, the final extent and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
Another updated description of the outbreak was described in the Zell on February 11, 2020 in 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, in a multi-disciplinary study (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but especially those aged 65-30.
About half of the victims (47.7%) were over 50, very few under 20, and only 14 victims were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was mainly spread in Hubei and surrounding areas.
The average COVID-19 diagnosis was 5 (9-2) days from the start.
The average growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The average time from start to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The primary reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
As per mass transit times before the Spring Fair in China, the number of cases increased rapidly before June 23, 2020.
The confirmed case mortality rate was %1.44 (%95 Cl:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was %3.06 (%95 Cl: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, complex viruses, which are part of the RNA complex of the senses.
They are divided into four genera, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
Melphophospic (S) glycoprotein binds its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the peptidal peptide 4 (DPP4) to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then the membrane fuses.
The viral genes are released into the cytoplasm, then after replicating the viral genes, the genes form a version with RNA, containing glycoalcemic and neoclylocytoparine, which then fuses with the plasma membrane to leave the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
More than 99.98 percent of samples collected from the original location of the outbreak linked to the Huainan seafood market in Wuhan identified a new strain of SARS-CoV-2 as BTA.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Thanks to electron microscopy transfers, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found on the extremely narrow part of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor not only for SARS-CoV-2 but also for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-cell of SARS-CoV-2 is more vulnerably linked to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which agrees with the fact that SARS-CoV, causes less infection than SARS-COV-2.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form novel shortcuts coded by orf3b and coded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenesis and may express itself in IFNB, however, there is no known active domain or form of orf8.
On February 18, 2020, Zhao et al. reported complexity in EM structure at full length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å islands with amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexity, which combines open and closed mutations as a dimer and ACE2-B0AT1 complexity, can bind two S-systems, which can identify and confirm infection from the COV.
B0AT1 may be a treatment for drug screening in suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate representative
It is well known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, both from bats, have been transmitted to humans through cats and camels.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the leprosy is considered a native representative of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to the two SARS-like CoVs Bat-SL-CoVZX45 and Bat-SL-COVZX21 of the leprosy.
However, it is not yet known which intermediate has helped to overcome the barriers to affect humans, and the route of the transition cannot yet be defined.
G, Y, Al, proposed snakes as a virus carrier from bats to humans, including homologous restoration within S protein.
Researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that a study suggested that the 99% of genes found in long-snouted penguins, chewing mammals, pegolins and SARS-CoV-2 - commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine - may be a possible middleman of SARS-CoV-2 depending on the sex.
However, the 1% spread difference between the two genomes is still a huge difference, as well, as the final results of the comprehensive evidence are awaited.
Most physiochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs can survive for up to 5 days in dry environments up to 48 hours and in temperatures below 20°C and humidity up to 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, and to 56°C heat for 30 minutes, or to 75% ethyl, chlorine-containing disinfectants, paracetic acids, chloroform, and other fatty disinfectants, but chloridexide cannot effectively inactivate the virus.
The entire human population in general is immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is susceptible to novel viruses.
Currently, no detailed study of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported.
So, we can refer to past studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoVs.
Typically, when a virus attacks a host, the host's immune system recognizes it through first-type receptors (PRRs), which include C-type lectin-like receptors, tal-like receptors (TLRs), node-like receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
By various means, the virus stimulates inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of Interferon Type I (IFN), which limits the spread of the virus and stimulates its antiviral genes to accelerate the micro-phase fungus.
However, the N-cell virus of SARS-CoV may help prevent immune responses.
Soon, a positive immune response becomes involved in the fight against the virus.
T lymphites including +CD4 and +CD8 play important roles in cell defense.
T cells of +CD4 stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus and T cells of +CD8 directly kill the virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing apoptosis to T cells.
Hormonal immunity supplements including C3a and C5a and antibodies are essential to fight viral infection.
For example, MERS-CoV is neutralized by antibodies isolated from a recovered patient.
On the other hand, the abuse of the immune system produces many locally-occurring free radicals that can damage the lungs and other organs, and, worst case scenario, many organs stop working and even die.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is characteristic of the early clustering, and is more likely to affect older and pregnant women.
It is common in people who have two to four of the most viruses or who have weakened immune systems, who are more likely to become infected than others.
Based on the first 425 cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, the growth period is estimated to be an average of 14-1 days, mostly 7-3 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases found that the average growth period ranges from 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
As stated above, a recent study shows that the growth period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days based on 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health officials to set effective quarantine times based on the most appropriate growth period to prevent people from transmitting the virus from those who are infected but do not show symptoms.
In general, people infected or infected with the virus need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Often the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19 is fever, with no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, scratches, knees, chest pain, diarrhea, diarrhea and diarrhea.
Some patients experience shortness of breath and/ or convulsions within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have rapid improvements in severe respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidity, and freezing.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even abnormal pulmonary imaging, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 found that 98% of patients with fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea symptoms, 8% needed ventilation assistance.
In two recent studies, similar findings have been made about the cause of a housewife's rash and the transmission of a person's rash from a homewife to a person without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 study found that patients with MERS-CoV also had primary symptoms of fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them needed ventilation assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients, and MERS is more lethal than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (%26) and sore throat (%21) were also observed in MERS patients.
It has been shown that fever (100-99%) dry cough (75-29%), shortness of breath (42-40%), diarrhea (25-20%) and sore throat (25-13%) were important symptoms in SARS patients, and about 20-14% of patients needed ventilation assistance.
As of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%.
Conversely, the mortality rate in 8,096 confirmed cases of SARS as of November 2002 was 10%.
Based on a demographic study in June 2012, the mortality rate among 2,494 confirmed cases of MERS was 37%.
A previous study reported that the R0 reproductive count of SARS-CoV-2 was higher at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 reproductive range of SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
This table 1.1 compares the symptoms, mortality rate and reproductive numbers of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than both latter viruses.
So, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
The gang often starts with a boat, such as a family or a gathering or ride.
Often patients have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with affected people or patients in the last two weeks before onset.
However, it has been reported that people can keep the virus inside for two weeks without symptoms and patients who recover from hospital recovery may be exposed to the virus again, which bells out to prolong quarantine.
These patients had less or equal white blood cells at the initial level (especially lymphocytes).
For example, lymphenia with white blood cell counts < 4×109/L including lymphocyte counts < 1×109/L, and spore-amino transfer levels and vermia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had increased levels of liver and muscle fibers and blood myoglobin, and most patients had increased blood levels of C-deactivated leukemia and atherosclerosis.
In severe cases, the blood D-dimer, or Fahrenheit deficiency, was increased, so the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Contrast-to-normal features in chest radiography of COVID-19 patients are blurredness on two-way complex shadows or ground glass in the lungs.
Most often, patients develop common pneumonia, severe lung pain, and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Respiratory distress syndrome, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and increased fibrosis greatly compromise gas exchange.
Inactivation of type I and type II pneumotides reduces the level of the head factor and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the risk of the lungs developing and failing.
So, the worst chest radiographic results are parallel to the extreme severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 according to the pathology of SARS and MERS patients and ARDS and viral infections revealed pneumocytes, hyaline formation, and medial lymphocyte penetration, and multicellular sinus cells in the lungs of the patient who died from the disease.
Reverse transcriptase polymers chain reaction (RT-PCR) was the key criterion for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
On February 13, 2020, in China, due to the high rate of negative lies, which could accelerate the epidemic, medical data was started to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer entirely dependent on RT-PCR).
The same thing happened with the SARS diagnosis.
Therefore, for an effective diagnosis, the history of the disease, medical descriptions, laboratory tests, and radiological results must all be shared.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang Group outlined a protocol for using CRISPR-based sherlock techniques to detect SARS-CoV-2, which will use a wide range of dipsticks in less than an hour to detect RNA fragments of synthetic SARS-CoV-2 from 20x10-18 microl/liter to 200x10-18 microl/liter (100-10 copies per microl/liter for input) devices.
The hope is that if confirmed in medical samples, the new techniques will dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with Novel CoV, mainly therapists can provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also trying different therapists that were previously prescribed or used to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include recent and potentially viral anti-viral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological assistance.
Even plasma from recovered patients was recommended for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are in a race to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks primarily the lungs, and perhaps other organs that exhibit a small amount of ACE2, such as the stomach and kidneys.
However, respiratory failure and lung failure are the greatest risk and leading causes of death for the patient.
Therefore, to help eliminate symptoms and save lives, respiration includes general oxygen, high-flow oxygen, non-interference ventilation and mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress have to seek help with the use of a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique to treat the risk of fatal heart attack or respiratory failure, via the ECMO.
In addition, for the care of the light, treatment and prevention of secondary infection and septic shock is essential to protect vital organ functions in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is said that patients with SARS and MERS develop cytokine stroma as a result of immune system abuse.
Cytokine stroma is a type of regulated inflammatory reaction that is produced by a series of cytokine releases including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
They add cytokine immune cells to release large numbers of free radicals that are a major cause of respiratory distress syndrome and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine stroma, especially in patients with severe illness.
Corticosteroid ears and a two-cysesomab anti-IL6 molecular antibody have been used to treat cytokine stroma.
Treatment to suppress other immunity to cytokine stroma includes: IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF blocked; JAK blocked; kinetic cell suppression 4; and HADC inhibitory, directed modification of T cell of immune response.
Steroids were widely used as immunosuppressants as a treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage in SARS.
However, heavy doses of steroids were not beneficial in patients with SARS and COVID-19 lung disease.
Instead, it can cause severe side effects, especially dramatically affecting the diagnosis of avascular osteonecrosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of multiple doses of corticosteroids are recommended to be used with caution in severely ill COVID-19 patients.
There is no confirmed effective antiviral treatment yet.
However, with the remetisavir vaccine injected into the vein in a US patient with COVID-19, the Nucleotide AnaLog was found to be effective.
Remitsware is a novel antiviral drug, originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, Remitsware was declared potentially blocked to prevent other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead supplied a mixture of it to China for a pair of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected people, with results far higher than expected.
In addition, baricetamol, interferon-a, lupenavir/retonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as possible treatments for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms.
Treatment with lupinavir/retonavir in combination may result in diarrhea, diarrhea, cirrhosis of the liver, liver damage and other adverse reactions.
The compatibility of this treatment with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
There is a long history of collecting blood from patients recovering from the infectious disease to treat other patients with the disease or protect healthy people from the disease.
In fact, most recovering patients have relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) that help to fight pathological genes and other exogenous objects through B lymphocytes and identify and directly neutralize pathogen-specific molecules.
Based on this, plasma was collected from patients recovering from COVID-19 and administered to 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms, such as inflammation and viral load and lack of oxygen in the blood, improve within 24 hours.
However, a specific treatment has not yet been developed, so it is important to verify and explain it before recommending its widespread use.
In addition, in addition to seeing the effects of treatment, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should also be considered.
For example, antibodies boost the immune response, and can cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially fatal to poison.
The number of antibodies in the blood is usually reduced, and the demand for plasma for treating critically ill patients is higher.
It's hard to develop specific antibodies so quickly to fight a global pandemic.
Identifying the genetic code to screen effective antibodies against the essential antibodies of the virus is a delicate and difficult process to separate B cells from recovered patients and to encode effective antibodies.
This way we can speed up the process of making antibodies.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat various ailments.
However, its effects largely depend on the combination of multiple ingredients in a formula, which depends on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Many effective ingredients are unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and verify such ingredients or their best combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become an important alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or who have recovered from the critical stage.
For example, Zhu Feng Ji-lu capsules and Li Huang Cheng-wen capsules have proven to be effective in treating COVID-19.
Several provinces in China saw high rates of improvement in treatment of COVID-19 patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent) N'jia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), using 87 percent of their patients with traditional Chinese medicine, while Hubei province, which used only 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients with traditional Chinese medicine, had the lowest recovery rate of 13 percent.
However, this is a fairly rigorous comparison, as the effects of this analysis should include many other factors such as patient numbers and severity.
On February 18, 2020, Boly Jing and colleagues published a study comparing the treatment of Western medicine (WM) with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the group of Western medicine + Traditional Chinese medicine alone, when compared to the group of Western medicine, maintained body temperature, alleviated symptoms, and stayed in hospital, was unusually shorter than the time needed.
Most impressively, symptomatically increasing (mild to severe) symptoms were significantly lower in the WM+TCM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate (8.8% versus 39%) was unusually low.
However, traditional Chinese medicine is still awaiting better and controlled trials of its efficacy and safety at larger and more centers.
It will be interesting to highlight the methodology of traditional Chinese medicine, to describe its effective ingredients or, if possible, its combination.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are mostly afraid of highly contagious and even fatal illness, and quarantined people experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of infection such as fever, seizures, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment caused by corticosteroids such as insomnia, increased anxiety, and stress, can lead to a higher risk of heart disease.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatric patients have been reported to have persistent mental stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychological arousal, psychological symptoms, depression and suicide.
Identifying and quarantining contacts as part of the COVID-19 pandemic public health can make people more anxious and guilty about the impact of conflict, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Similarly, COVID-19 patients, suspects, people in contact with them as well as the general public should be provided with mental health care if needed.
Multi-disciplinary mental health teams in psychological support, plans for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment, and clear communication with ongoing and accurate updates on the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other should be established.
Effective vaccines must be available to prevent transmission from animal strains and susceptible humans to infectious agents, and antiviral treatments are often needed to control emerging viral outbreaks.
Efforts have been made to develop a S-Lehemia-based vaccine to create long-term and vital neutralizing antibodies and/or immunity against SARS.
A direct-effects vaccine for SARS was analyzed in animal samples.
However, the efficacy of these vaccine candidates in protecting against the elderly, lethal challenge samples and animal virus infections cannot be determined before clinical trials can begin.
This is because SARS was eliminated 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, there is a continuous stream of MERS outbreaks in the Middle East and other regions with permanent sources of animal viruses.
A vaccine strategy for preventing MERS has been developed using virus deactivation, DNA plasmas, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recovered beta subunits, and some of these have been tested on animal samples.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and critical task to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, overcoming this challenge is challenging due to the long-term (average 18 months) vaccine development and the need for dynamic variations of CoVs.
COVID-19 has begun to show its medical course in thousands of patients as a novel disease.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without a chain.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, healthcare agencies need to create disease diagnostics models to prioritize their services in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may be linked to the diagnosis or exposure of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in diagnosing SARS, which is now also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affected people aged 65-30 years, with 47.7% of the 8,866 patients in the above-mentioned study being over 50 years old.
Patients with higher risk of basic co-occurrence complications require more intensive care, and are more likely to be elderly than those without such complications (average age of 66 years instead of 51), who present age as a diagnostic process for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As stated above, SARS-CoV-2 affects men more than women (0.31/100,000 compared to 0.27/100,000).
We are depressed and complicated: COVID-19 patients who need intensive care are at risk of severe heart and respiratory attacks.
Heart attacks are also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also be linked to ACE2 positive cholangioside, which may lead to liver failure in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly intertwined and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: Blood levels of C-reactive plasma (CRP) reflect the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and are suggested as a potential analytical process for treatment response and ultimate recovery of the disease.
C-reactive levels of leukemia have been suggested for the severity and diagnosis of COVID-19.
Additionally, elevated lactate dehydroxyl genes (LDH), aspirate aminotransferase (AST), ala-nin aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase may also help predict outcomes.
These lesions are expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and they result from tissue damage.
So they're a traditional marker of heart or liver failure.
Important medical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporary improvement in medical symptoms should be considered in combination with other tissues to predict the outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As mentioned above, steroid immunosuppression is commonly used as an adjunct treatment in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since large amounts of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from avascular osteoncerosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, very small amounts of steroids should be used for short-term use in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients during the COVID-19 pandemic experienced unusual stress due to enduring long quarantine and witnessing the unreasonable death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counselling and long-term support are essential to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19's epidemiological characteristics seem to be different from SARS.
In addition to wrapping in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also wrap in the upper respiratory tract, and cause mild to no symptoms, like the common cold caused by other CoVs in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, early or growing patients can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when the patient is seriously ill, while there is little transmission in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe than the SARS epidemic and is quite difficult to control.
At the moment, in China, hopes and efforts are underway to disrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by keeping Wuhan and surrounding cities under lockdown and the entire population in constant quarantine.
While these measures are damaging the country's economy and other sectors dramatically, they are reducing the number of new cases, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most welcome thing is that the epidemic will end in March and its Dovan Swing phase will be in three to four months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimates that COVID-19, which looks like a more contagious disease than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Era Longue et Al., has set up a model for predicting outcomes of a global pandemic, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group said mid-turbine and throat patches of patients recovering from hospital two weeks ago showed they were infected with SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a strain of influenza.
However, based on the decline in the number of new cases, China has been finding promising indicators, indicating that the current strategy is working.
Ebola was originally predicted to be one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been cured.
It is also possible that, like SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 will become weaker in spreading the infectious disease and eventually disappear or remain present in humans like a low-carcinogenic virus.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS (55).
SARS-COV-2 is transmitted through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with contaminated material from the virus.
The virus is also found in the gut, which creates a new possibility of transmission from the gut to the mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases found that 41 percent of cases involved 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 healthcare providers, possibly due to a non-neuronal infection.
Therefore, people, especially healthcare providers, social workers, household members, colleagues and even those in contact with patients or victims, should be very careful.
The first line of defense to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series # 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks prevent fluid droplets from traveling through the air from a potential victim or from sticking to the surfaces of objects from which they can reach others.
However, only N95 (serial #1860) masks can prevent the small virus particles from entering the respiratory tract from 10 to 80 nm, only 5% of the virus particles can enter completely, similar in size to SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV, both about 85 nm.
Although five surgical masks can be combined, the molecule can penetrate them, so healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (serial #1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear isolation gowns to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he had to wear an N95 mask; the virus probably entered through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should wear transparent face shields or glasses when working with patients.
It is highly recommended for people in affected or potentially affected areas to wash their hands more often than usual with disinfectant soap, self-quarantine at home and try to limit contact with potentially infected people.
A distance of three feet from the patient is considered a reasonable distance.
These functions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus in the human world, it is the most common type of SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, and should cause a high alert for China based on a deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, on January 19, 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control reassured citizens that the novel virus has a low infectious and limited reproductive capacity from human to human and that prevention and control of the disease is not a problem.
This message brought a significant relief to the public's alarm, especially as they prepared for the Spring Festival, and wasted time in Wuhan to control the disease on a minimal scale.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned a hard lesson and made significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be careful when making public announcements as each word is relevant to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be sensitive to and respond to clinical information rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or staff; (3) prevent early control of a potential epidemic, rather than relieving the public; and (4) frequently raise public awareness of pandemics and use targeted and impactful practices to periodically test and improve the community response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak started in December 2019 through novel virus SARS-CoV-2.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries worldwide.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS re-emergence.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for keeping out the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women and has a higher severity and mortality rate among older people than young people.
SARS death rates are higher than COVID-19 (10.91 percent compared to 1.44 percent).
COVID-19 patients can transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients do so when they are seriously ill, making it more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is relatively faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
Some COVID-19 patients may have a regular RNA negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Otherwise, patients who recover may be positive again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several key issues remain to be addressed, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96 percent of genetic homogenization between SARS-CoV-2 and two strains of SARS-like CoV has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in fungi.
Who was the original representative, from the leatherback, of the mid-species of human-to-human transmission of the virus?
Without knowing the answers to # 1 and 2, we cannot effectively slow down the transition process and it can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical testing indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to this ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and what pathological changes it results in?
Does the virus bind to cells that express ACE2 in other organs?
Without the right answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human transmission?
Will it become a global epidemic, disappear like SARS, or just keep happening like a cold?
This is important, but it may take some time to find answers to the above and some other questions.
However, no matter how much it costs us, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
Animal sources of human coronaviruses
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have led to the mutual evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their host organisms, including humans.
Before 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses such as the common cold.
The severe respiratory distress syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory system (MERS) have raised coins to show how devastating and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 once again highlighted CoVs and surprised us with its faster transmission and decreased pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is an animal-to-human infection and it serves us to understand the animal origin of HCoV.
Most HCoVs originated in fungi where they are non-pathogenic.
Some HCoVs are also known to be intermediate host organisms of reservoirs.
Identifying host animals that directly affect human disease prevention.
Investigation of the CoV-host organism in animals provides important awareness of the pathogenesis of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the knowledge available about seven HCoVs, focusing on the date of their discovery, as well as their animal origins and mixed allele transmission.
Importantly, we compare and differentiate between different HCoVs from the evolution of different viruses and their genetic regeneration.
In this context, the current COVID-19 outbreak will be discussed.
In addition, the implications of viral immunity on the requirements of successful host organisms and the severity of the disease have been highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses, which includes a group of mucous, positive, single stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which use large genes such as 26 to 32 kBases between RNA viruses, were called "CoVs" because of their crown-like morphology from the electron microscope.
Structurally,CoVs have undifferentiated genes that participate in a common organism.
About two-thirds of genetics consists of two large open reading frames mounted on each other (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate into the polynomial mapping of pp1a and pp1ab.
This polynomial produces 16 more nonstructural polynomials, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome includes ORFs for structural biology, including the recumbent S, the multivitamin E, the membrane M, and the new nucleus N.
A number of specific-stringed auxiliary lemma are also encoded by different strands of CoVs.
Based on differences in the settings of the Belchium, CoVs are classified into four strains (Alpha-CoV, BTA-CoV, Gamma-CoV and Delta-CoV), with the BTA-CoV strain consisting mostly of HCoVs and divided into further strains (A, B, C and D).
Evidence from phylogenetics showed that, most bats and mice are the genetic source of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the largest reservoirs of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV are birds.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently overcome the barriers of different species and some of them have emerged as major human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Typically HCoV-229, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause mild colds and/or diarrhea-like symptoms.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing lower respiratory tract infections with a relatively high risk of developing severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extraplumonary manifestations in relatively more patients.
In the mid-1960s, the strain of HCoV-229E, B814, isolated those with mild colds from those with nasal discharge.
Since then, more and more information has been collected through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that infection with HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is the most devastating event in current history, affecting more than 8,000 people with a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East outbreak of respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a permanent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula that spread to the rest of the world.
2019 Novel (HCoV (2019-nCoV, later renamed SARS-CoV-2), is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), which has claimed over 3,120 lives and infected over 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding and the world needs to prepare for the upcoming global outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs are origin animals of leatherback, rat or pet.
Multiple lines of evidence support that all HCoVs originate from the epidermis of evolutionary origin, where viruses express well-adapted and non-pito-genic but high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented countless medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
Animal tracing of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, spread potential and restrictive factors of transmission across species.
It may also assist or guide in finding hosts of SARA-CoV-2 deposits, intermediates and breeding animals with significant implications in preventing future recurrence.
In this review, we will present a review of the pathogenesis of the source animal, mixed allele transmission and HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common idea that the paternal viruses of HCoVs are usually non-pathogenic in host organisms of their natural reserves and become pathogenic after transferring to their new host organism.
We also assess the evolutionary trend of HCoVs, which often increases transmission with decreased pathological genes.
The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolated, nasal discharge of HCoV-229E strain B814, patients with mild colds isolated various animals infected with different CoVs including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoVs in historical order (Table 1) will be informative and educational.
In 1966, HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, and later adopted to amplify WI-38 cell lines in the lungs.
In 10 to 20 percent of cases of HCoV-229E-infected patients, mild colds, including headaches, dizziness, restlessness and inflammation of the throat, have been reported with fever and cough.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and then placed in the serial pathway of the small mouse brain.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of people infected with HCoV-229E, which are not symptomatically different from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhino viruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 spread globally, and they are more prevalent in temperate climates during the winter.
Generally, the growth time of both viruses is less than a week, followed by a disease that lasts for about two weeks.
According to a voluntary human study, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E cause mild colds.
Only a few immunocompromised patients have severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as "a common pneumonia", was the first well-documented global epidemic in human history caused by HCoV and is the SARS-CoV ethnological agent, the third discovered HCoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced to late 2002 in China's Zhuangdong province.
The SARS outbreak that spread across many countries and continents resulted in 774 deaths with 8,096 cases.
In addition to the rapid spread, it was estimated that each case, with a growth period of 4 to 7 days and a viral load limit of 10 days of disease, could increase to about two secondary cases.
A SARS-CoV-infected patient initially has symptoms of muscle pain, headache, fever, anxiety and cold, followed by shortness of breath, cough, and late-onset breathing discomfort.
In rare laboratory tests of lymphocytic pania, SARS, it is rare to have random liver function and some elevated creatine kinases.
The spread of alveolar discharge, spread of epithelial cells and increase of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
After that, about 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In these severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney, can be affected, usually with cytokine stroma, which can be especially fatal in patients with low immunity.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of an index patient who had traveled to Hong Kong from Zhuangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been devoted to research into HCoV.
During late 2004, HCov-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands.
It is initially found in young children, the elderly, and patients with low immunity with respiratory disease.
Inflammation of the nasal mucosa, diarrhea, fever and inflammation of the nasal passages are common in HCoV-BL63.
Another independent study described identifying the virus from a sample of the nose of an 8-month-old pneumonia-stricken boy in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it was actually distributed globally.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of the common respiratory disease, and symptoms are severe in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with preventing cough, also known as craving.
In the same year, a 71-year-old Hong Kong man who was hospitalized for pneumonia and carotid artery inflammation was isolated from HCoV-HKU1.
HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with severe asthma, along with community-derived pneumonia and inflammation of the carotid artery.
Similarly, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, which have mild respiratory disease, were found worldwide.
These four community-derived HCoVs are highly compatible with humans and are generally unlikely to cause a highly pathogenic disease mutation, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons, such as a rare case of a more severe subtype of HCoV-NL63 that caused severe respiratory tract infection, recently reported in China.
Generally, when they acquire the ability to transmit and maintain HCoVs within humans, they become low-grade harmful or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated from the lungs of a 60-year-old Saudi Arabian patient suffering from severe pneumonia and kidney failure in 2012.
Where most laboratory-confirmed cases occur in the Middle East, and occasionally imported cases with secondary spread in close contacts in European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, a secondary outbreak broke out in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS' medical description is similar to SARS, which has developed severe pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have severe renal failure, which is very unique to MERS in HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30 percent of patients have symptoms of diarrhea and diarrhea.
As of February 14, 2020, 34.4% of the more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases had died, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses found in humans.
During mid to late December 2019, a large number of patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection-associated pneumonia were previously identified from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing outbreak of respiratory infections due to SARS-CoV-2 to be a global concern, and has designated it a public health emergency, and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 3.4% of those treated dying.
Specifically, in Hubei, China, the death rate for these cases is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
Like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also causes severe respiratory infections and is presented as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients have also been diagnosed with diarrhea.
One of the most severe symptoms is pneumonia and it can increase severe respiratory distress syndrome.
Although 82% of high-level nucleotides are similar due to continuous similarity, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar, but it is a hybrid of different branches of the pathological tree.
Apparently, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Symptoms of non-symptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 were reported that may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparisons and contrast with the other six HCoVs of SARS-CoV-2 reveal many interesting similarities and differences.
First, there is a great deal of similarity in the duration and duration of the growth of HCoVs.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the other four community-derived (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 has been commonly observed to exhibit its infection characteristics during community-derived HCoVs infections, including with nonspecific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can also be seen as SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is somewhat low.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 reveals interesting features like community-derived HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the minimum transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the community received from HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be confirmed that, like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it enters humans.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in waste samples.
Although in at least some cases where future studies are yet to clarify whether SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in oral waste transmission, as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It will also be of particular interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will also be seasonal, as well as community-derived HCoVs.
However, once in humans, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including transmission, pathogenesis and sustained spread will affect the end of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-derived HCoVs that adapt well in humans cause mild symptoms.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both types of ancient HCoVs could survive a global epidemic.
HCoVs that cause severe disease in humans and humans that are susceptible to severe HCoVs have been eliminated.
To do this, HCoVs that collect the desired mutation will have to replicate in humans to resist the restriction of host organisms to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and affects the more people, the more likely it is that humans will fully adopt it.
If it is well adopted, it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, four community-derived CoVs have been circulating in the population, causing a common cold in immunocompromised individuals.
These viruses do not need animal storage.
In contrast, humans have not adapted well to the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and their transmission to humans cannot be sustained.
They need to grow and breed in their animal reserves, and potentially find opportunities to spread to sensitive human targets through one or more medium and widespread host organisms.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-derived HCoVs.
At least for now, it has a higher potential to spread like community-derived HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-derived HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether humans will fully adopt it and circulate it among humans without any reservoirs or intermediate host animals.
Before we talk about the origin of HCoVs, it will be best to talk about the evolution, nature, reserves, medium and large determination and characteristics of HCoVs host animals.
An animal, if it has a closely related ethnicity, serves as an evolutionary host organism for HCoVs, sharing high levels of similarity at the nucleotide sequence level.
Viruses usually communicate well in this ethnic host organism and are non-pathogenic.
Similarly, host organisms shelter HCoVs continuously and for long periods of time.
In both cases, host organisms are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its pathogenic virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs are introduced to humans at or before the introduction of a mid-range host organism, they cannot adapt to the new host better and are often pathogenic.
This intermediate host organism can act as an animal source of human infection and then play the role of a rapidly increasing host of massive human infection in humans.
If HCoVs cannot maintain transmission within the medium host organism, it will go into a closed pathway of infection.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to medium host organisms and even establish long-term nutrition.
In this case, the medium host becomes the host of the natural reserve.
Epidemic data have disappointingly revealed that SARS index cases have a history of contact with game animals.
A subsequent non-proliferation investigation revealed that the contrasting SARS-CoV lgG is higher in animal traders than in the general population.
The first live animals on the animal market were masked palm seeds (Pegwoma larvae) and a raccoon dog that were identified with viruses such as SARS-CoV that are similar to SARS-CoV.
It indirectly supports the fact that no SARS was reported after all the cats in the markets were killed.
However, it has been reported that masked palm seeds from forests or fields were largely negative for SARS-CoV without an appearance in the live animal market, suggesting that masked palm seeds may be acting only as an extensive medium host organism but not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
In particular, since 80% of the different animals in Zhengzhou's markets have SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility of multiple small mammals acting as an extensive medium host organism for SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of these appear to be closed-path host organisms of SARS.
A search for a natural host animal for SARS-CoV has revealed a closely related skin-to-skin virus, called SARS-related rhinovirus skin-to-skin CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3), present in the Chinese horse's needle-to-skin.
These mites are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and a genetic sequence of SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share a 92-88% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host organisms of human pathology.
Multiple SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from mosquitoes, but none can be classified as a living virus except for a designated WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is called the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 derived from a sample of leather waste was demonstrated to be used as a receptor for the leather, cats and human ACE2 entry cells.
Interestingly, the recovered SARS patients from Sierra were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest to the SARS-CoV-CoV genealogy of bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence similarity.
However, despite the extreme similarities between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct patriotic virus of SARS-CoV and that the larvae are not hosts of SARS-CoV immediate storage.
The strains of MERS-CoV from the same group were studied as the bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5, respectively.
The bacteria use the same representative receptor, Dippital Peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus, CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV.
RNA-dependent RNA polymer sequences of MERS identified from Europe and Africa are polygenically closer to their counterparts in the beta-CoV.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closely related bat CoV-HKU25 share only an 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Thus, the leatherback cannot be the host organism for the immediate stockpiles of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that in several African countries, like the Middle Eastern camels, a single-cobed camel is seropositive for the specific antibody that neutralizes MERS-CoV.
The virus, similar to the human MERS-CoV, was isolated from the nose of a camel with a cobra through the snout, and further suggests that camels serve as the true host organism of MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that experimentally, camels infected with MERS-CoV were observed to have mild symptoms but a large viral outflow.
In particular, infected camels spread the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the waste oral tract, which is also the primary route of transmission of the virus from the larvae.
However, questions remain as there is no history of MERS confirmed cases linked to camels before the onset of symptoms, including human-to-human transmission or unknown animal species, which shelter MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is a contributor to 96.2% nucleotide similarity with the isolated Ranioloxus-BAT- isolated CoV RaT13-BAT.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cases, the paternal relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is excellent for assigning.
I mean, the bat cannot be the host organism for direct deposits of SARS-CoV-2 until it finds a nearly identical bat CoV in the future.
Most likely, Hunan's seafood wholesale market, which has many early cases of COVID-19 associated with and potentially indicative of animal-to-human transmission, will be the intermediate host for the wildlife species to be sold and killed for SARS-CoV-2.
Several recent studies based on meta-genetic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as penguins (Manus Javenica) may also be a haven for SARS-CoV-2-related native BTA CoVs.
These novel penguin CoV genes share a 85-92 percent nuclear TIS sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are as closely related to RaTG13 with approximately 90% identification at the level of the nuclear-tide sequence.
These files are germs of a subgenus similar to SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which shares a continuous amino acid identification of 97.4%, as well as a receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13, despite a high degree of consistent matching genetic range, are more diverse.
Previous studies on diseased Pagulin reported viral posthumousness, similar to the corresponding SARS-CoV-2, in lung samples.
The study adopted a variety of assembly methods and manual protection for partial genetic sequencing, which is about 86.3% of full-length viral genetics.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the penguin is one of the mid-range hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support direct SARS-CoV-2 from the source of the penguin due to the sequence differences between the BTA CoVs of SARS-CoV-2 and penguin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is also shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the BTA related SARS-CoV-2 penguin CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, penguins and other mammals is yet to be established.
While, the best sequence similarity has been found in the receptor-binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and penguin, SARA-CoV-2-related BTA CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the best broad genetic sequence similarity.
It is highly speculative that, selective mediation between the SARS-CoV-2 and Pagulin SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domains of BTA CoVs is being operated through careful evolution.
A counterproposal in favour of a re-composition between beta-CoVs and RaTG13 related to the third wildlife species of penguin SARA-CoV-2 has been made.
The widespread spread of re-infection among B-CoVs is present as a driving force in evolution.
A direct animal source of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be determined.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied as being animal sources.
File genetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be the original source of the bat CoVs, while pathogenic viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Applachin Ridge Cove) in North American termites has been closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, the term hyposiderosis/Ghanahuam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, and is suspected to be a medium host organism in camels as well.
For clarification, the current knowledge about the animal origin of the identified HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
File genetic analysis has provided evidence of mixed-species transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When the domestic live stock HCoV-OC43 crossed the species to infect humans around 1890, a global outbreak of respiratory infections was recorded.
The date of mixed allele transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Beta-alpha-CoVs have been found to be closely related to HCoV-229E.
There is an alpaca-alpha-CoV between them.
Several pieces of evidence support the direct transmission of the virus from mosquitoes to humans.
First, the shared ecological niche may be human contact with bats, not alpacas.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in the bat, while the alpha-CoVs are caused by the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaca-alpha-CoV was not found in pets.
Thus the possibility that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nafa virus, and hendra virus, are a direct source of skin fats.
So it's no surprise that the leatherback can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where the beta-alpha CoVs act as a genetic pool of HCoV-229E, there are alpacas and camels that can act as intermediates, just like cases of MERS-CoV, which transmit viruses to humans.
MERS-CoV serves as a prime example of mixed allele transmission from bats to one-horned camels and camels to humans.
The evolutionary source of MERS-CoV in the skin is known as early identification and is also reinforced by later results.
Apparently, the skin glands provide a rich pool of viral types for the transfer and interchange of genetic and intergenic fragments.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly, are favorable conditions for the skunks to become an ideal 'virus transmitter'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to a cattle camel for decades.
It has adapted well to camels that have gone directly from host organisms to stable and naturally occurring host organisms.
MERS-CoV maintains very mild disease and relatively low rate of variation in these animals.
Its occasional transmission in humans is an accident and humans are closed-path hosts of MERS-CoV because they cannot sustain its transmission.
Unlike the camel's role in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of the penguin, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, penguin B-ta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in penguins.
They may be closed-path hosts for SARS-CoV-2 B-ta-CoV which is similar to the SARS-CoV case in cats.
Future studies may include or exclude multiple possibilities for mixed allele transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans.
First, the SARS-CoV-2 mosquito that can be the source of a host organism similar to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans share an environmental niche with bats through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, penguins may be one of the fastest-growing medium host organisms, with the newly introduced SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans are drawn to the virus by slaughter and hunting.
It is possible that several mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies are guaranteed in surveys of domestic and wild animals.
Third, as mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 reuptake and adaptation can occur in a third species that binds to both bats and penguins.
The search for the animal source of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the variety of host animals, CoVs are critical in facilitating the viral transition to a variety of barriers by three major factors.
First, RNA replicates have relatively high rates of mutation.
Compared to the second isolated RNA viruses, the determined mutation rate of CoVs can be considered "moderate" to "high" while the average replacement rate per year on each site 2 is 10-4 replacements, depending on the stage of adaptation of the novel host organisms to the CoV.
CoVs have proof-reading external bonycles, which are erased to make them more highly variable, attention-grabbing, even unobtainable.
Interestingly, the Neutral Tide Analog Remediator is known to suppress the replication of CoVs by inhibiting these extracellular and RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
Remediciere is the highly intelligent agent tested as a counterpart to SARA-CoV-2 in medical practice.
However, the rate of mutation of CoVs is a million times higher than that of its host organisms.
In addition, oftentimes when CoVs cannot adapt well to host organisms, it has a higher rate of mutation.
Comparing the highest rate of mutation of SARS-CoV, the apparently well-adapted SARA-CoV-2 has a lower rate of mutation in humans.
It has probably already adapted to another host organism near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, which adapts well in a cottage camel, is also applicable.
In theory, it is unlikely that enlarged genes will render vaccines and antivirals immediately ineffective against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the genes in CoVs demonstrate the use of additional modulation in genetic modification for major RNA mutations and re-composition, thus increasing the probability of the mixed allele's mutual evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by a number of unique reading frames and the help of coding the functions of the Lechemic towards the 3' end of the genome.
Third, through a unique mechanism of "copy selection", CoVs often switch randomly to RNA templates.
During the replication of CoV RNA, the host organism acting as a mixture, frequently changes in the strands.
Full length ultrhomologs and re-fusion of subgenetic RNAs can be used to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of natural phylogenetic synthesis has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as Bat SL-CoV and Bat CoV-HKU9.
The virus's host organism communicates with the transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, viral interaction with host organisms is a key factor in effective and mixed allele transmission.
Also, SARS-CoV reuptake is taken as a common example, which showed positive selection during mixed allele transmission.
In addition to a comparative analysis of the isolation of SARS-CoVs in humans and seeds, SARS-CoV is thought to be rapidly adapting to different host organisms, especially with variations in the receptor binding domain of S-Leachemia.
In general, the receptor-binding domains in the S-cell of CoV interact with the cellular receptor and are highly selective by the host organism's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain on S1 fragment is 318th to 510th amino acid, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its corceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV receptor binding domains are capable of identifying ACE2 receptors in various animals, including bats, cats, mice and raccoons, that allow mixed allele transmission of the virus.
In fact, only six amino acid residues in the receptor-binding domain were found to be different in isolated viruses in humans and cats, four of which are found in the form of receptor-binding to interact with ACE2 receptors.
The SARS-CoV receptor binding domain of the cytochrome contains K479N and S487T variants, which may enhance the interaction of the receptor with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids can be important sub-alternatives to viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy, that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov in the S1 unit of S-Lehemia indicates that the necessary association of human ACE2 with its S-Lehemia may change.
Indeed, a study by a classified electron microscope suggests that this association is -10 to -20 times greater than the association between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S-Laemia.
It will also be interesting to determine whether other subreceptors will be needed to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to ACE2, but to a different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as amino peptide N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetyl-acetic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They can calculate the successful adaptation of these CoVs after mixed allele transmission from their host animal to humans.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of HCoV mixed allele transmission is monitored, depending on another host organism and by binding factors.
The spread of these host beetles between humans and hosts with natural reserves of HCoVs, such as bats, a camel-backed camel and rats, can hinder mixed allele transmission.
HCoVs have factors of dependence on the irritated host organism and factors of interference to the host organism for a successful mixed allele transfer.
In this regard, molecular determination of the identity and characteristics of this critical part of interaction with the host organism of the virus remains to be made.
Impartial extensive genetic testing of host dependence and binding factors for SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial using the latest CRISPR technology.
Novel HCoVs release: Go back to zero ground
Variation of the bat CoV provides ample opportunities for the release of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, the Bat CoVs act as a pool of HCoVs' genes.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic re-engineering also accelerate the evolution of HCoVs and serve as two key steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of a novel biochemical coding gene demonstrates the ability to rapidly alter viral phenotypes.
In SARS-CoV helmetology, ORF8 is considered critical in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found a different ORF8 helmetology encoding.
The 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoV have been characterized by the elimination of strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is a compatible mutation that promotes transition in host organisms.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible re-synthesis with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where large numbers of RNA-dependent RNA polymers were identified as small regions of re-synthesis.
The locations of the retrograde were identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has also been observed that the MERS-CoV epidemic, which occurred in a camel-in-the-mouth in Saudi Arabia, has experienced cases of re-fusion between different strains.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, cases of re-infection have also been observed in other CoVs, in which HCoVs re-synthesize with their non-structural genes with other animal CoVs.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to undisclosed changes in viral genetics, possibly by avoiding selective pressures, such as the host organism's immune system, resulting in the elimination of the virus.
An example of this effect is the loss of the full length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229 E, which causes two nucleotides to be removed.
Although ORF4 persistence can be observed in HCoV-229E-related leather and camel viruses, Alpaca shows a single neocliatoid entry of alpha-CoV, resulting in frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by selective pressures in host organisms of their reservoirs.
When the skin is infected with CoVs, a symptomless or mild symptom is detected, indicating a mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the skin.
It appears that bats are well adapted to anatomy and physically to CoVs.
For example, defects in activating pro-inflammatory responses in the skin glands effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoVs.
In addition, the skin cells are subject to stress due to low levels of expression of the NKG2/CD94 receptor, a natural killer cell that inhibits the activity of natural killer cells, and the large histological compatibility complex class I.
Furthermore, reactivating high levels of the highly metabolic activity-derived oxygen-like reactions (ROS) of the skin by suppressing both CoVs replication, and by influencing proof reading by exorbitant bonycellosis to form highly pathogenic virus strains, provides selective pressure when a new host organism is introduced.
More pathogenic CoV strains can be produced by re-synthesis, which can increase the host organism's adaptation to acquire novel or biological properties.
So, it's no coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs cause non-pithelial genes or mild symptoms in their stores of host organisms such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without the immune response of a powerful host organism.
In it, the secrets of why disease-carrying animals are shown to be symptomless and what causes severe cases of human infection are hidden.
Severe symptoms are primarily caused by hyperactivity of the immune response and cytokine stroma, which, with a strong immune response, causes more severe lung damage.
In contrast, in a symptomless carrier, the immune response is de-copulated by a copy of the CoV.
The same strategy of immune response decomposition has a beneficial effect in treating the antiseptic SARA-CoV-2.
Interpharonic reactions are particularly strong in the skin, especially in the vertebrates.
Therefore, the organization of type I interferons should be beneficial, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3's inflammatory activity in the skin is impaired.
For this reason, NLRP3 anti-inflammatory treatment with MCC950 may be beneficial in the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak follows the common belief that emerged through SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Where a beta-ta-CoV has been found to share a 95% neocliotic similarity to SARS-CoV, there is a beta-CoV that is sharing a 96% neocliotic similarity to SARS-CoV-2.
While the seeds and other animals in the market have been found to shelter viruses such as SARS-CoV, the direct intermediate host organism of SARS-CoV-2 has not been identified.
Penguin B-ta CoVs have been found to be surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, meaning that penguins are acting as one of the intermediate host organisms or that penguin B-ta-CoVs may contribute to the final version of SARS-CoV-2 through genetic fragments.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was created by humans intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have come to light again due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in bats and other animals have radically changed our views on animal origins and animal deposits of HCoVs in human transmission.
Extensive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from the skin and are transmitted to humans through an intermediate host organism.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is caused by human-seed contact in markets, the SARS outbreak can be effectively eradicated by closing meat markets and killing seeds.
Therefore, given the discovery of multiple strains of penguins B-ta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2, penguins should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, future investigations have yet to clarify when and where SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through penguins and other mammals.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around for a long time in a cottage camel.
For the local people, they serve as the primary source of meat, milk, leather and wool, as well as the main means of transportation.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So just as everything that was done in China to stop the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 was done in China, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS.
To prevent the recent spread of MERS, along with other infection control measures, an understanding approach should be adopted to develop an effective vaccine against MERS for camels.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, they can lead to the emergence of new genetic variants.
Animal CoVs are circulating in the forest.
Specifically, the varieties of the skin-to-skin CoVs with efficacy in animals are very diverse.
As a result of the emission of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future, there are many opportunities for animal CoVs to develop and regenerate.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, wildlife-eating culture in some parts of China should be abandoned.
With SARS, MERS and COVID-19 testing, improved preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, there have been many viruses on the planet for a long time.
They live in their natural reserves until they have the chance to grow.
Although there are many traits in skinned animals that cause the spread of viruses, if people are educated, the chances of human contact with skinned animals and other wildlife species can be reduced.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for a better understanding of the COVID-19 virus and its natural hosts, which will be effective in preventing the spread of the disease from animals to humans and its future spread.
As a result, by keeping humans away from the natural environment of the virus' natural reservoirs of animal-to-human diseases, the virus can be more effectively prevented from passing from animals to humans.
Several pieces of the puzzle of being the source animal of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if a leatherback transmits an ethnic virus of SARS-CoV-2 to a penguin, it would be interesting to see how leatherback and penguin can share the same environmental power under what conditions.
Second, if the skin plays a more direct role in human transmission, it should determine how humans come into contact with the skin.
Third, if the third mammal acts as a true intermediate, it must explain how it interacts with other species including humans, bats and penguins.
Finally, because many other mammals, including domestic animals, can be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and testing for infection should be conducted.
If there are bats, penguins or any other mammals, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 and its almost identical pathogenic viruses will be identified among its natural representatives.
Continued research in this field will explain the significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans as well as the evolutionary journey of SARS-Cov-2 in animals.
The diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19 must be renewed
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Rapid Consultative Guide to the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, which provides our experience and is a good reference for fighting the global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing gradually based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guidelines, issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China, that provide the latest diagnostic standards for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the final guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version).
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak, now officially known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is termed as Severe Respiratory Disorder Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), broke out.
On 11 March 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a quick consultation guide and it was published online on 06 February 2020 in Military Medical Research.
It has received much attention since its publication.
Note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing gradually based on the results of ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
For example, the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China issued the Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), a total of seven issues were issued from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, with some fundamental changes being made in the context.
Now our guide has received a comment from Zhao et al. who suggested a simple score based on their medical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and is a valuable reference to this global pandemic.
We acknowledge and thank them for their outstanding work.
However, their work also needs to be updated to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh issue (March 3, 2020), confirming a suspected case requires a comprehensive analysis of any one characteristic of the epidemic history with two items of medical description combined, or combining three items of medical description without a clear history of the epidemic:
History of outbreaks: (1) History of travel or residence in Wuhan City and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) History of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with a positive test for nucleic acid); (3) History of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan City and surrounding areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) History of contact with a set of confirmed cases (with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks from a small area such as a home, office, school class, etc.)
Medical descriptions: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with conceptual characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Early onset white blood cell counts indicate normal, decreasing, or low lymph site counts.
Pathogenetic or serological evidence must show a confirmed case with one of the following items: (1) positive real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2; (2) continuity of the entire viral genome showing high prevalence of known novel coronavirus; (3) positive serum testing for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgM antibodies and lgG antibodies; or negative for SARS-CoV-2 specific lgG antibodies or ≥4 times the recovery of tires in the severe stage.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Pathogen detection in blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) issues; and serological evidence was included in the seventh issue.
Research-based editing is underway to find the maximum nucleic acid detection kit for a faster diagnosis in a verified standard, as well as taking respiratory tract including blood samples that increase the availability of various samples, and help bring positive results for specific antibodies.
In addition, there is much more evidence that reminds us of caution with patients with conventional and symptomatic symptoms.
So, the Zoot-all flow charts should be updated because they classify individuals without medical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system also needs to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
As a result, we hope for more direct evidence and invite readers to express their views.
To assess "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we advise them to track and follow the latest guidelines in their home countries.
Our team updates our guidelines in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh has reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest daily
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of today, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of reported cases includes 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who stayed at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
Speaking in an online news release, IEDCR Director Dr. Merzedi Sabrina Flora said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr. Mir Jeddi, two cases were over 60, two between 51 and 60, and one between 41 and 50.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the global outbreak of COVID-19 as the first global pandemic.
An official at the hospital told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saif al-Rahman, the director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Agency, who was being cared for at the Mitra Hospital in Kuwait.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obid Al Kadir, said that public transport will be closed for a long time from this coming week under initial planning.
The public transportation closure initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on weekdays on April 4.
Transportation of essential goods -- medical supplies, fuel and food -- was still allowed.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh on March 8 were reported in the wives of two people who returned from Italy and one of them.
By March 19, all three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded one million infections globally.
On Thursday, Johns Hopkins University data indicated that the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection globally has exceeded one million.
Some 52,000 deaths are related to COVID-19, a disease that is caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone came on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zambia's first coronavirus death.
As of Thursday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries that is still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases, as of 10:44 am Central European time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
More than 244,000 coronavirus cases were recorded in the United States, with 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that as of Wednesday, more than 1,000 Americans have died from coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, countries have announced tough measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin announced that payments to Russians without work will continue until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted in favour of a 15-day extension of the national emergency; the vote passed 215 votes in favour, 10 in favour, and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew for the entire day in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina Manura: previously, the curfew was effective from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand will impose curfew from 10 pm to 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Devine announced that the state has extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australian stores reduced the range of toilet tissue paper in each transaction
On Sundays and Saturdays, Australian store chains Walworth & Coils have reduced their restrictions on the purchase of toilet tissue paper in all stores nationally to two and one pack per transaction respectively.
ALDI also introduced a pack range on Monday.
These boundaries were posted as messages on the checkout, and chain's Facebook back pages.
Shoppers were reported to store it in case people needed self-made isolation due to fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Walworth also limited the purchase of toilet tissue paper for home delivery to one pack per order.
The changes followed four pack restrictions on each transaction previously introduced by Woolworth and Coils on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Cooles, in a media release on March 8, said that with four packages restricted to one place, "many stores are still selling within an hour of delivery", and the demand was described as "unprecedented", while ALDI on Tuesday, in a Facebook post, called it "unexpected".
According to a Wallworth spokesperson, sales "surged dramatically" last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited last week's allowance to two packages.
To reduce the shortage, Coals ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery continuity, Walworth ordered additional stockpiles, while ADLI stored for special early availability on planned Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but the local council's time-barrier to delivery trucks has made it difficult.
They're not just increasing production costs, because suppliers try to meet demand and do something special.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to the stock discount, some stores will not be able to operate on a specific Wednesday.
Retail expert Dr Gary Martimer of Queensland University of Technology, said in a News.com.au report that stores fill up every night.
He said toilet tissue paper is a big thing, which means it has a small amount of storage, and, when sold, leaves a lot of shelf space empty, which makes for a severe shortage.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News, "Coil and Woolworth's review [is] that if there are a lot of things on the shelf, if products like toilets and sanitizers can be bought, and if they're in quantity, maybe you can reduce panic.
A crepe-making recycled toilet tissue paper maker said last Wednesday that it would run out of storage.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly Clark, who makes clean toilet tissue, and Solaris, who make surbent, insisted they were working 24/7 to maintain supply.
Property buying and selling site Domain.com reported that some Melbourne property sellers offer free toilet tissue paper to the first bidder at the auction, when buyers had time to do so due to the long weekend on World Labour Day.
The eight-page inscription was added to the Thursday issue of the Daily Darwin, NT News, which meant that they were cut and used as toilet tissue paper.
According to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March, the stores were actually refusing to impose the restrictions, which they said they had no plans to introduce a ban on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that there is a high demand for other products including masks, sanitary, dry goods, hand washers and flour.
Similarly, on Sunday evening, outside Australia, British supermarket purchases were observed to be limited to a pack of two to 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the ongoing spread of COVID-19  The coronavirus is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2  a global pandemic.
While the term "epidemic" refers to the rapid spread of a disease, not to the extent to which specific cases are dangerous, the World Health Organization stressed the need for action by governments.
All countries can change the course of this global pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize their people in response,
We are very concerned about the two dimensions of this disease, because of the acceleration and severity of its spread and the alarming extent of its response.
According to Dr. Tom Fredian, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the global epidemic is "unusual".
"Apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has seen such a continuity from the start to the global pandemic", he said in his comments published in CNN in February.
Gibbes expressed the same idea, saying, "We have never seen a global pandemic like the coronavirus".
"And we've never seen a global epidemic that can be controlled at the same time", he continued.
The new status of the global pandemic came in January after the World Health Organization's decision to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Echwony Fusi, director of the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the initiative, "The point is, it's leading to more disaster".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide had reached 126,000, resulting in 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is a variant of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which is caused by severe respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2).
The outbreak was identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan on December 2019, and declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020, and was identified as a global epidemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people have been rehabilitated.
The mortality rate in China is estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04 percent in Algeria to 8.8 percent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and symptoms of severe breathing difficulties.
The period from onset to onset of symptoms is usually about five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Early treatment is symptomatic and supportive - recommended precautions include handshaking, mouthwashing, distance from others, and monitoring and isolation for those who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have been vocal in support of travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, workplace risk control and lockdowns.
The pandemic delayed disruption, economic, religious, political and economic events in several global social economies and led to widespread shortages of goods due to uncertainty in purchasing.
Schools and universities in 193 countries were closed either nationally or locally, affecting about 99.4% of the world's population.
Misconceptions about the virus spread online and there were incidents of prejudice and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and those who had the most cases of the virus.
Low traffic and the closure of large industries have reduced air density and carbon emissions.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (headquartered in Hubei Province), reported a collection of pneumonia cases from an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and a study was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were from the Hunan seafood wholesale market, and so the virus is believed to be a strain of animal diseases.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus that was closely related to the skin coronaviruses, penguin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. The first person to show symptoms of the disease was diagnosed on December 1, 2019, and the person had no apparent association with the aforementioned market gland.
Two-thirds of the initial incidents reported in December 2019 were market related.
On March 13, 2020, the South China Morning Post in an unconfirmed report recommended that the first case of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on November 17, 2019 may be the first - on February 26, 2020, the World Health Organization reported that while cases are declining in China, due to the sudden increase in cases in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded new cases within China for the first time.
It may also be less common, especially in people with common symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of global cases. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Valance estimated that 60% of the UK population would be affected before effective mob development could be achieved.
According to the official protocol, cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and have been confirmed to have tested positive.
No country had tested 3% of its population until March 23, and it is the official policy of many countries not to test only those with mild symptoms, as in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 showed that in China, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected by January 23 and that these unregistered cases were the source of infection in 79% of registered patients.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections reported in Italy was significantly higher than reported cases.
The initial estimate of primary reproduction for COVID-19 (R0) is 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who don't realize it, the time from onset of symptoms to death is 6 to 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths in people over 60 years of age and 75% of people with pre-existing conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes- COVID-19 global death toll figures generally consist of those who tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The exact number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, because these deaths do not include those who die without testing - for example at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of additional deaths during the global pandemic was more than x4-5 times the official death toll from COVID.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know [the reported death toll] is low", confirming reports of low death toll in the United States. Such mitigation reports are often found during a global pandemic as during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths outside central China had occurred in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, more than 40 countries and regions have reported deaths from every continent except the South China Sea.
The number varies with region and time, and is influenced by testing, quality of treatment systems, treatment options, time after the initial outbreak of the epidemic and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health. The incidence-to-death ratio is obtained by dividing the number of deaths over a given period by the diagnosed incidence.
Based on June Hopkins University data, the global death-incidence ratio as of April 10, 2020 is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The number varies by region.
The incidence-death ratio in China (for individuals from the onset of symptoms to January 1, 2020) has dropped from 17.3% to 0.7% (for individuals from the onset of disease to February 1, 2020) - other measures include the mortality rate (CFR) which represents the percentage of people diagnosed with the disease who die, and the infection-related mortality rate (IFR) which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These numbers are not for a specific time and are for a specific population from infection to final resolution of the issue.
Several experts have tried to count this number for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall infection-related mortality rate in this global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper limit of this estimate is consistent with the results of the first variance of COVID-19 tests conducted in Germany, and a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the global epidemic can be controlled.
The outbreak and the deadline vary and are uncertain depending on the location.
"If left unchecked, the multiple sclerosis usually increases like a plateau and then starts to decline when the disease doesn't have any more hosts", says McAvoy of Penn State University.
But it's absolutely impossible, to make a reasonable plan for when it will happen, right now".
"It could be over by June", stressed Zhong Nanshang, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, if all countries are encouraged to follow WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Charski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine told him that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue to circulate for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (probably 18 months or more)".
William Scheffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think it's likely that the coronavirus will be completely eradicated because it's easily contagious" and it "will turn into a seasonal disease, and it will come back every year".
The death toll of the return will depend on the reduction of the African population and its extent of variability.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively uncommon and affected people can be symptomless.
Two common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include low back pain, low back pain (hypertension), sleep apnea, shortness of breath, pain in the joints and ligaments, sore throat, headache, cold, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhea or blue fever. The World Health Organization reports that about one person in every five gets seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergencies as: shortness of breath, recurrent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blurring of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended - further development of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, body rot, blood clots, and death.
Some of these affected individuals may be symptom-free, they can be confirmed patients without clinical symptoms, so researchers recommend that people who come into contact with confirmed patients should be closely monitored and tested to avoid infection.
China's symptom-free disease rate is measured from a few digits to 44 percent.
The incubation period (medium time between infection and onset of symptoms) typically ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. For example, in the uncertainty situation, the loss of the sense of smell in people affected by COVID-19+ initially occurred in 30% of people who later decreased to 15% of people.
Some details of the disease's course are also being clarified.
It is believed that the disease is initially caused by close contact and by small droplets of facial hair that occur when you cough, sneeze, or talk; where close contact is between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that without a damper, you can drop from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet) from the ground.
People have suggested that viruses can also spread from long-term airborne droplets that form when speaking; breathing droplets can also occur when exhaling, including during communication, although the virus is not usually present in the air.
These droplets can creep into the mouth or nose of nearby people or possibly into the toes when breathing.
Some medical procedures such as inhaling tubes and artificial mouth-to-mouth respiration (CPR) can extract the humidity from the breath and thus allow it to escape into the air.
It can also occur when someone touches the affected surface and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are fears that it may even spread through the face, the threat is underestimated.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through excretion. The virus is highly contagious for three days before symptoms begin, although it can be transmitted before symptoms and in the final stages of the disease.
Since people can be tested positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, it is believed that transmission is possible even before effective symptoms appear.
Only a few confirmed cases have been reported from the laboratory where there are no pre-existing symptoms of the disease but no symptoms have been detected during the investigation of contacts in some countries.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease can spread, a person can typically infect two to three people - the virus can survive for hours to days at different levels.
Specifically, the virus was detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on paper for one day and on copper for four hours.
However, the duration varies between humidity and temperature. Tests for COVID-19 in pets and other animals have been positive.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, but British authorities recommend that people touch animals after contact, as they do when contacting other surfaces that are touched by an infected person.
Severe respiratory symptoms Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, isolated from three previously infected people with pneumonia who fall under the category of severe respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All of the properties of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the corresponding natural coronavirus - outside the human body, the virus can be eliminated by household soap, which dissolves its immune shell.
It is believed to be descended from animal diseases.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to the family of two strains of the common cold virus (B-CoV), the B-CoV, which is derived from two strains of the common cold virus (B-CoV).
Overall, the genome level is 96% similar to that of the other bat-borne coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13) sample.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that only one amino acid difference between human and penguin viruses is found in a few parts of the genome chain.
Comparisons of the entire genome to date have shown that 92% of genetic material is often combined with the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is enough to prove that pangolin viruses are mediocre hosts.
Temporary diagnosis of infection with the virus may be based on symptoms of the disease, although the confirmed infection with fluid or ICT X-ray is ultimately confirmed by the reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan found that although less specific than PCR, CT is significantly more sensitive, although its reflex properties dominate processes in other pneumonia and diseases.
The American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for screening or as the first marrow test for COVID-19 diagnosis by March 2020.
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
The test uses the reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR) at the same time.
This test is performed on a sample of breathing gas or blood.
The results are usually available for hours to days.
This test is usually done by analgesic injection, although analgesic injection can also be used in the throat - several laboratories and companies have also developed antibody testing, which detects antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these have been proven valid enough to be approved for mass use.
A serological test developed by SELEX in the United States has been approved for emergency use only in authoritative laboratories.
The radiography and computed tomography (CT) of people who have symptoms of the disease include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opses and absent excess flow.
The Italian Radiological Society is building an international online database of imaging results of certified events.
Due to overlap with other infections such as the adenovirus, imaging identification of COVID-19 without PCR verification is limited.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR results that showed that although the imaging is low-grade for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks were created to detect the imaging properties of the virus, both through radiography and CT.
Strategies for preventing the spread of the disease include maintaining overall personal hygiene, stretching the hands, chewing the eyes, nose or mouth without hand washing, and chewing and chewing the tissue and placing the tissue directly in the garbage can.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Distance measures are also proposed to prevent transmission of the disease - many countries have restricted travel or avoided unnecessary travel to other countries or prohibited travel to areas affected by the pandemic.
However, the virus has reached the point of spreading to communities across much of the world.
This means that the virus is widespread within the community and some community members do not know how or where it has been infected - healthcare providers, who are at risk of contracting the disease, are advised to take standard contact and eye protection precautions - contact tracing is a key method for health officials to identify the source of the infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of Sushma Mahal data by governments via mobile phones to this end has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and 100 other organisations issuing a statement calling for restrictions on surveillance.
As of April 7, 2020, various mobile apps have implemented or recommended it for voluntary use, with more than a dozen groups working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to allow users to access the palace from other mobile phones.
The user then receives a message if he or she has been near someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about infection prevention are circulating; for example, flushing the nose with water and washing the face with a seven-ounce cloth are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however several institutions are working on developing one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC often advises people to soap their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are apparently dry; before they wash; and when someone is cleaning their nose, or taking a nap, or flushing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap when its protective shell is exposed.
The CDC recommends using more alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume, when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth without their hands.
The levels must also be purified in several ways (stainless steel levels must be kept in front of a disinfectant for one minute), including %62-71 ethanol, %50-100 soopropanol, %0.1 sodium hypochlorite, %0.5 hydrogen peroxide and from 0.2 to %7.5 pavedon-iodine.
Other methods, such as benzalconeum chloride and chrohexydric gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a suspected or confirmed COVID case occurs in a location, such as an office or nursery, all areas - office, toilet, joint smoking, joint electrical equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, ATM machines, which are used by sick people - be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouths with their curved ankles or tissue when coughing and sneezing and destroy such tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may be affected, as wearing masks limits both the volume of droplets emitted by the affected person and the distance to be reached when they speak, sigh and sigh.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear a mask.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask can reduce the likelihood that people [will] touch their faces, which is a major source of infection if they are touched without proper hand hygiene".
The World Health Organization recommends wearing masks only for healthy people if their health is at serious risk, as if they are treating a COVID-19 patient, although it acknowledges that wearing masks prevents people from touching their face.
Several countries have begun to encourage people to wear face masks.
CDC in the United States recommends wearing non-medical face masks made of fabric - China has specifically recommended that healthy people in the public use disposable medical masks, especially when others are likely to be close (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks while using public transportation or staying in crowded places.
Thai health authorities are encouraging people to make and wear face masks at home every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going public without wearing a mask or covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam has asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has authorized everyone to wear a mask when entering the shop.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when going out in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, also requires passengers to wear masks on trains and buses between cities from April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear face masks when going out, while recommending that masks be made available for those who cannot afford to buy them.
Face masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves disease control actions aimed at reducing the spread of infection by limiting close contact between individuals.
These include quarantine, travel restrictions, closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, cinemas or shopping malls.
Individuals can apply social distancing practices while staying at home, avoiding crowds, not receiving greetings and physically distancing themselves from each other.
Many governments are enforcing or advising social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The overcrowding recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (where the area map shows no known COVID-19 cases) to 50 people, which was later increased to 10.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with a medical condition such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system may face severe illness and complications, and the CDC advised them to stay at home longer due to an outbreak in society. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health agencies began replacing the practical term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that its purpose is to limit physical contact while maintaining social contacts, either by maintaining social distancing or by maintaining distance.
The term social distancing has led people to feel that they should be completely isolated from the world, rather than encouraged to connect with others through seven alternative ways.
They also recommend that you only have sex with seven people who have no symptoms of the virus or virus.
Home self-isolation is recommended for people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are suspected of being infected.
Health institutions have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended that the entire population living in an affected area go into self-isolation quarantine.
The strictest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued for people in the most vulnerable category.
People who have had contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where widespread transmission is taking place have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
The strategy for controlling an epidemic is to prevent, control, or repress and mitigate.
The control strategy is developed in the early stages of the epidemic and aims to identify and isolate those affected, introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinate to prevent the disease from spreading to other people in the population.
When it is not possible to prevent further spread of disease, the first phase of mitigation is the effort to reduce its spread and its impact on the health system and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures should be taken simultaneously.
To contain the global pandemic, more stringent measures are needed to reduce the epidemic to less than one of the main causes. Part of the infectious disease response is to try to reduce the epidemic's rise, which is called the epidemic response.
It reduces the anxiety for health services, which are becoming overwhelmed, and gives more time to develop and treat vaccines.
Medical measures that can manage the outbreak include precautions, such as hand cleaning, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; social measures aimed at maintaining physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling mass events; community engagement to encourage people to accept and participate in such interventions; its seven environmental measures, such as keeping surfaces clean - the overly stringent measures to prevent the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the epidemic was revealed, such as tightening quarantine and travel restrictions on entire cities.
Other countries have taken a number of different measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has conducted massive screening and local quarantine and issued alerts on the movement of affected persons.
Singapore provided financial assistance to those affected who quarantined themselves and imposed heavy fines on those who did not.
The production of face masks and authorized storage of medical supplies in Taiwan increased. The similarities between the United Kingdom and the United States show that mitigation (the spread of the epidemic is declining but not ending) and stress (the global epidemic is increasing) are major challenges.
Over-reduction policies can increase healthcare demand by up to two-thirds and reduce mortality by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelming health systems.
Stress can be preferred as a transition but it must continue as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first) otherwise it quickly returns to recovery when measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to suppress the global pandemic cause social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral drug approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including trials on existing drugs.
The use of cold medicines, drinking plenty of water, and relaxation help to alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, oxygen injections, intravenous injections, and breathing aids may be needed.
Steroid use can make the outcome worse.
Many compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being researched for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO has also said that "some traditional and domestic fragments" can help alleviate SARS-CoV-19 infections.
Increasing the capacity and adaptability of healthcare providers to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by the World Health Organization as a key step in responding to the pandemic.
The EDC and the World Health Organization Regional EU Office have issued guidelines for the transformation of resources for hospitals and primary health centres at various stages, including focusing on laboratory services on COVID-19 testing capacity, rejecting optional procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and enhancing critical care capabilities through staff training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are many theories about where the first episode (i.e. the zero patient) started.
The first case of the novel coronavirus was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei began to rise gradually.
The majority of these cases are linked to the wholesale seafood market in Hunan, where live animals are also sold, and there is a theory that the virus comes from this species; in other words, the virus is from a strain of animal diseases. The incidence of pneumonia cases from unknown causes was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr Zhang Xixuan at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported the Wuhan Xi'an CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Central Wuhan Hospital warned their staff about "coronavirus like SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Van Leeuwen, were warned by police to spread false rumors and another, Ai Fan, was denounced by his top officers for making a false statement.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public statement on December 31 and notified the World Health Organization.
By early January, Wuhan health authorities had reported enough cases of unknown pneumonia to order an investigation. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, with significant role played by Chinese New Year traffic as Wuhan became the main transportation hub and railway interchange.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official figures showed that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms as of January 20, 2020. By March 26, the United States had outnumbered China and Italy globally for the most confirmed cases. As of April 9, 2020, there were more than 1.61 million reported cases worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 were in good health.
At least one incident has occurred in about 200 countries and regions.
Because of this globalization in Europe, several countries in the Schengen area have restricted traffic and established border control systems.
The national response includes measures to control such as quarantine (called stay-at-home orders, shelter orders or lockdowns) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90% of the population, are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people are in lockdown in the Philippines, about 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of lockdown, rising to 2.6 billion after just twenty days, which is about a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 virus was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unverified report reports the first case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhangjian observed a surge in pneumonia cases from an unknown cause on December 26, which his hospital notified Wuhan Xiangang CDC on December 27.
On December 27, 2019, early genetic samples of patients were tested for the presence of coronavirus such as SARS.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public warning on December 31.
The WHO was notified the same day.
When the reports were received, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially claimed that these were not "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched an extremist campaign later dubbed by Communist Party of China Secretary General Xi Jinping as "Public War" to curb the spread of the virus.
Called "the largest quarantine in human history", an environmental cleanup campaign was announced on January 23 banning travel from Wuhan, which was expelled to 15 cities in Hubei and affected a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles is prohibited in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (25 January) were canceled in several places.
The authorities announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Hoshinshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Then another hospital, the Lechanshan Hospital, was built to take care of additional patients.

In response to the central authorities' decision to enforce a transport ban in Wuhan on 23 January, WHO representative Gaudin Ghiah said that while there was really "no recommendation from the World Health Organization" about this, "it was a significant indication of the pandemic's commitment to control in a place where the epidemic has become more prevalent" and called it "unusual in the history of public health". After the disease was confirmed to be human-to-human from China on 30 January, and due to the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the World Health Organization declared the epidemic a global public health emergency of concern (PHEPIC), the face of a PHEIC of this nature that began during the global flu pandemic of 2009.
WHO Director-General Tedros Ahadnom said that PHEIC was "due to the risk of global outbreaks, especially for low- and middle-income countries where there is no robust health system".
In response to the travel ban, Tedros said there was no need for measures that would unnecessarily interfere with global travel and trade and that the World Health Organization advises limited trade and mobility.
On February 5, the World Health Organization appealed to the global community for $675 million to help low-income countries develop epidemic strategies, outlining the need for emergency aid for countries that do not have a system that can track people who are infected, even if it does".

On February 14, a WHO-led joint mission team was activated with China to assist international and WHO experts in domestic organization on Chinese soil and to host workshops and meetings with key national bodies to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" and "visit these areas to assess the impact of response activities at the provincial and district level, including urban and rural areas". On February 25, the World Health Organization announced that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus global outbreak", saying that although it would have been a long time before the disease was called an epidemic, countries should still be in the "emerging phase".
In the wake of the escalating epidemic in Iran, the World Health Organization sent a joint mission to Tehran to assess the situation. World Health Organization officials said on February 28 that the global risk of coronavirus would be raised from "high" to "very high", the highest level of risk identification and alert.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Emergency Plan, warned in a statement: "This is the place for every government on earth to really think: Wake up.
The virus may be on the way and you need to be prepared", stressing that the right response can help save the world from "its worst".
Ryan added that the current data does not allow public health officials to declare the disease a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean "we basically recognize that every human being on the planet will be exposed to the virus".
On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic.
The Director-General has said that the WHO is "deeply concerned both by the spread and the dangerous level of severity of the disease and the absence of adequate response" - the WHO has faced considerable criticism for its apparently inadequate response to the global pandemic, including delaying the declaration of public health emergencies and classifying the virus as a global epidemic.

Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the first admission of the coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan in favor of the US or Italian conspiracy theories of COVID-19.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that China's censorship made a virus so powerful that it has now become a global pandemic, in response to which some critics criticized it as bias and "an excuse to divert attention from administrative negligence in disease prevention".
The Daily Beast received a US government cable in which a letter apparently from a National Security Council official discussing the wisdom of Ali in seven conversations said "it's all about China".

The Iranian government is heavily affected by the virus, with at least two dozen parliamentarians as well as fifteen current or former political figures affected.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has written a public letter to world leaders on March 14, 2020, asking for help in the fight against the pandemic, saying that his country is struggling with the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The pandemic has warned the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries including universal health care, universal childcare, overpaid family benefits, and overfunding for public health.
Political analysts predict this will negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have been strained by the global pandemic.

In Australia, the global pandemic gave Diego shoppers a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
These activities have led to food shortages for newborn babies in some supermarkets which have since been immediately banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the growing demand for food items, both regions have survived severe food shortages.
China and Italy's actions against the stockpiling of essential goods and illicit trade have been successful, as they prevented the severe food shortages expected in North America and Europe.
Northern Italy, which is very important for agricultural production, has seen no significant decline in output, but prices may rise according to industrial representatives.
Empty food shelves had to be temporarily seized, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure a large supply of food to the population.

According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the global pandemic-induced recession could put another 14 to 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America.
In January and February 2020, when the epidemic was at its peak in Wuhan, China lost about 5 million jobs.
Some 300 million rural migrants in China have been trapped in their homes in remote areas of the provinces or have fled to Hubei province. More than 10 million Americans were unemployed in March 2020 and have applied for government assistance.
According to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus disease could cause 47 million dollars in damage in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. In India, the lockdown has left millions of workers (daily wage earners) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reader Institute found that 44% of domestic Canadians were somehow unemployed.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for the Universal Credit Scheme. Almost half a million companies in Germany sent their workers to a government-backed short-term work scheme called Courzert.
France and the United Kingdom have also adopted a German short-term work compensation scheme.
The global arts and cultural heritage sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, which has also affected the activities of seven individuals in institutions, including both self-employed and self-employed.
Arts and Crafts organisations sought to uphold their mission (mostly publicly supported) to provide access to cultural heritage to society, protect their employees and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, art venues and other cultural institutions in various directions around the world were closed indefinitely and their exhibitions, events and events were cancelled or postponed.
In response, considerable efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and fastest failure of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, key events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week in Rome, which falls on the last Sunday of the Christian Lent, was cancelled.
Many priests have advised older Christians to stay home rather than attend Sunday services; some churches have started broadcasting church services by radio, live TV, or online while others are holding car-based services.
As the Roman Catholic clergy of Rome closed their churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square was emptied of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also closed their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and parishes.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers gatherings in areas affected by the pandemic and the closure of shrines, while Saudi Arabia has banned foreign visitors and the closure of holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has, since World War II, disrupted the world's sports calendar significantly.
Major sporting events, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA, the 2019-20 season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
The spread has disrupted plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to start in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the activity "will be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not postponed beyond the summer of 2021". Casinos and other sports venues have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or canceled.
This has led to a large number of online gamblers moving in, and a significant increase in new signups to many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been hit hard, with many music groups postponing or cancelling their concert tours.
Many major theaters, like those on Broadway, have also suspended all performances.
Many artists have discovered ways to use the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live streaming events, and share them with others, or to create web-based "fairs" so artists can perform, spread and promote their work.
There have been many memes online based on the idea of the coronavirus as many turn to humor and distraction in this uncertain situation.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese and East Asian populations, Europe, the United States and other countries where the epidemic has been severe, have seen excessive prejudice, xenophobia, fear of strangers and racism.
Fears, doubts and opposition have been growing, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
According to February reports (while most cases were confined to China), ethnic sentiment has been expressed among Chinese people around the world, which justifies the claims of the virus in return.
Anti-Chinese sentiment has also been seen in some African countries.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei have reported being treated differently on a regional basis.
For the Chinese, support has been provided both online and offline, and in the affected areas.
After the outbreak spread to other countries, people in Italy, the first country in Europe to experience the COVID-19 outbreak, may be fearful of suspicions and strangers. In an effort to contain the outbreak, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed petitions to ban Chinese people from entering their countries.
The hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become a trend in Japan on Twitter.
Chinese people and other Asian residents in the UK and US have reported cases of racial abuse and abuse.
US President Donald Trump has faced considerable criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", critics calling the term racist and anti-China.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhere.
Students coming from northern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in major Indian cities have been plagued by the coronavirus outbreak.
The Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal state unit president, Dilip Ghosh, said China had destroyed nature and "that's why God has taken revenge on them".
His statement was later condemned by the Chinese ambassador in Kolkata, calling it "misleading". Since the global pandemic in China, fear of strangers has been fueled by feelings of racism towards non-Chinese residents, calling foreigners "foreign garbage" which is "pushing".
Many pay-value newspapers have removed them for some or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific publishers made scientific papers about this spread available to the public.
Many scientists have sent their findings to servers, such as bioRixiv, before they can be published.
Emerging infectious disease - infectious disease or infectious pathogen, usually unique in its range of spread or mode of transmission
The study of the disease and its spread was published in the journal Geography and Disease.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes procedures to detect the presence and presence of viruses that produce antibodies as a result of infection.
RT-PCRs confirm the presence of the virus as samples, which detect the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm a very recent or active infection.
Antibodies (seriology) can also be used to diagnose detection and monitor population.
Antibody tests show how many people had the disease, including those with so few symptoms that they were too mild to report or had no symptoms.
The results of these tests can be used to determine the exact mortality rate and immunity level of a population.
Due to limited testing, no country has reliable data on the spread of the virus among its population as of 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is also a big difference in how many tests have been done between countries.
This variation has led to a significant discrepancy in the reporting of death rates, which is likely to be higher than estimated in some countries.
Tests on respiratory samples using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be obtained in a variety of ways, including nasopharyngeal strains or bulk samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
A throat-to-mouth PT-PCR test is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later, when the virus begins to spread in the lungs, it disappears in the throat.
For other infected subjects to be tested weekly, the sample material may be used alternately from deep airways via a suction catheter or cough up material (swelling).
The first PCR tests were developed in January 2020 at the Charity site in Berlin using real-time reverse transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) which formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 28 January 2020, South Korean company kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
The "E" gene tracks the BTA coronavirus spread, and the RdRp gene is specific to SARS-CoV-2. The BGI Group in China was among the first companies to receive approval from China's National Medical Product Administration for the emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through the International Regent Resource Center.
One of the three tests in the older version of the test kit failed due to poor chemical interaction, and fewer than 100 samples were obtained in a day in February 2020 due to testing interruptions at the CDC in Atlanta.
As of February 28, 2020, tests using two ingredients were not considered reliable, and this was until state and local laboratories were allowed to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. U.S. business laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
LabCorp announced the availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 nationwide by March 5, 2020.
Quest Diagnostics also made available COVID-19 testing across the country by March 9, 2020.
Quantity limits have not been announced; collection and further processing of samples should be in line with CDC requirements.
In Russia, COVID-19 testing was created and developed by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the test, which could be done in 3.5 hours, meaning that a machine could perform about 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abott Laboratories on Abott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp and Themo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method gives positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to increase the number of machines made to 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses monoclonal antibodies specifically limited to the nucleotide protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, in the hope that it can yield results in 15 to 20 minutes, like a rapid flu test.
The conclusion of the March 2020 review of the written material is that "an initial chest radiograph diagnosis is not important, however [CT computed tomography] is possible before symptoms appear".
Common features of CT are two-way multi-lober ground glass blurring with disproportionate and rear-end splitting coverage.
As the disease grows, it develops complete dominance, insanity smoothness and stability.
In Wuhan, where the global pandemic originated, a study comparing PCR and CT suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many features similar to pneumonia and disease stages.
By March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "CTs should not be used as a top priority for COVID-19 diagnosis". By March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early screening.
The immune response to infection, including IgM and IgG, is to produce antibodies.
They can be used to detect infection in people who have symptoms for 7 days, to determine immunity, and for people under close supervision. They can be tested in central laboratories (CLT) or a vaccine testing center (PoCT).
Automated systems designed for high productivity in many clinical laboratories will be capable of these tests, but their availability will be limited to the rate of production for each system.
A single blood sample is usually used for CLT, although multiple samples can be used to detect immunity.
A blood sample for PoCT is usually obtained by puncturing the skin.
Unlike the PCR procedure, prior to the test of emission is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA listed the 29 entities that provide the agency with notifications and are therefore now able to distribute their antibody tests.
Only one test was approved by the FDA for emergency use until April 7, 2020. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics were approved by Europe for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples.
It has the ability to test hundreds of samples in a few hours, so it's faster than traditional PCR for detecting RNA viruses.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK found that no test kits purchased were valid enough for use.
Hong Kong has introduced a scheme that suspects can stay at home, "the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube", they will stick it in, send it back and get results shortly afterwards. The UK's NHS has announced that they are launching a scheme on an experimental basis to test suspect cases at home, eliminating the risk of the patient passing the infection to others or if they come to the hospital an ambulance is free of the need to disinfect it once used.
Thanks to Drive-Throw Centers, South Korea has conducted faster and more tests than any other country. Germany's National Association of State Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that it has the capacity to conduct 12,000 tests per day in a general meeting and 10,700 tests last week.
When it comes to physiotherapy, the cost is covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct 160,000 tests per week.
The drive-in tests were offered in several major cities till March 19.
As of March 26, 2020, the number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
According to the lab survey, 483,295 samples were tested by the calendar week 12/2020 and this week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (%6.9) tested positive for 2-SARS-CoV. Researchers at Technion and Rambam Hospital in Israel developed and adopted a methodology to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, collecting all samples and testing further only if the sample is positive.
The first one.
The Wuhan Lab methodology was immediately adopted by the Huan-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, thus in a total of 12 cities across China.
Origami Assays has released open-source multicast designs that can test 1122 COVID-19 patients with just 93 attempts. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without a robotic fluid handler.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents had become a barrier to mass testing in the EU and the UK and the US.
Some authors have investigated a protocol to produce a sample that limits the samples to 98 C (208 F) for five minutes to extract RNA genomes or chromosomes for further testing. According to the March 31 announcement, the UAE is now testing more coronavirus of its population than any other country, and is pursuing a plan to reach its entire population.
This was achieved through both the drive-through capability and the large population-developed laboratory of the Grooup 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratories "HUO-Yan" in China).
Established in 14 days, the lab conducted 1,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first large-scale laboratory outside China.
Different testing techniques were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States to target different parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus.
The World Health Organization used the German formula for low-income countries, which do not have the resources to make cutbacks.
The German synthesis was published on January 17, 2020, with US-made protocols to control the disease not available until January 28, which delayed testing available in the US due to reservations about the quality of test kits in China and the US in the early days of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia could not provide cuts despite recommendations and demands from health professionals.
Experts say that South Korea's large supply of testing has reduced the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The South Korean government has been promoting testing capacity in private sector laboratories over the past few years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization urged to strengthen testing programs to mitigate the global spread of COVID-19. The virus's massive spread has led to increased demand for testing and tens of millions of tests being stopped in US private laboratories, and pressure on the supply of wound-cleaning syringes and chemical interactions.
In March 2020, China reported a problematic accuracy of its test kits.
The CDC kits made in the United States were "poor", the government then removed the office barriers that prevented private testing. Spain bought the kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate.
The firm explained that the wrong results were caused by faults or incorrect use of cuts in sample collection.
The Spanish ministry said that the false-results kits will be removed and replaced with the test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech state gave false results.
Prime Minister Matovek suggested that they be dumped in the Danube River. Atas Kara, Turkey's health ministry, said that the kits Turkey purchased from China had "a very high error rate" and were "not put into use".
The testing results showed positive results in the attempt to identify quarantined individuals and those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients in case of positive outcome.
In the Italian town of Vo, where the first COVID-19 death occurred, researchers working on the entire population, which consisted of about 3,400 people, were tested twice for at least ten days.
Nearly half of the people tested had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
The restrictions on travel to a particular group of people have completely eliminated new infection cases.
Due to extensive contact tracing, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic had little impact on Singapore compared to developed countries around the world, where there were no strict restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retailers.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay confined to their homes from March 28, but reopened schools in time after the holidays ended on March 23.
Many other countries have also managed to contain the global pandemic through strict measures such as patient contact detection, travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but not to tighten lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have more, in terms of mortality, have lower mortality rates may be because they have been able to detect people with little or no symptoms.
WHO has recommended that countries that do not have the capacity to test and national laboratories to deal with COVID-19 send their top five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to 16 WHO reference laboratories for verification testing.
Of these 16 reference laboratories, seven are in Asia, five are in Europe, two are in Africa, one is in North America and one is in Australia.
The column "% of positive tests" in the chart below relates to a country's testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all its citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, will take them all the same.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the process of cleaning your hands of dirt, dirt, germs, or other unnecessary materials.
Repeated handwashing with soap on certain "necessary occasions" prevents many diseases from spreading, such as diarrhea and diarrhea.
People can also suffer from respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
Five essential occasions a day when hand washing with soap is essential: before and after going to the toilet, after cleaning the baby's bottom or changing diapers, before feeding the baby, before and after cooking, or after touching raw meat, fish, or chicken.
The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands with the following tips:
Before, during, and after preparing a meal.
Before and after the treatment of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child using a toilet.
After a hard nose cleanse, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal food or animal waste.
Medical hygiene refers to the compliance of medical procedures with hygiene principles.
Washing hands or taking medical care before eating medication can prevent or slow the spread of the disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to keep the hands free of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or spread disease.
It's a good habit, especially for people who are in the food or medical field, but it's also a good habit for the general public.
Handwashing has many medical benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing the causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And the mortality rate for children born at home is decreasing.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing improved the height of children under five years of age slightly.
In developing countries, simple changes in habits can reduce infant mortality from respiratory and diarrheal diseases, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple process can reduce deaths from these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that encourage handwashing can reduce diarrheal mortality by a third, and this can be compared to clean water supplies in low-income areas.
Hand washing with soap can reduce diarrheal mortality by up to 48%. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and severe respiratory infections (ARI). It is an automated behavior that can be practiced in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five, killing about 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both cause about 3.5 million children's deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the practice of hand washing before and after meals to a natural remediation can save more lives than using a vaccine or medical intervention, i.e. half the deaths from diarrhea and a quarter the deaths from severe respiratory infections.
Handwashing is generally part of other health and hygiene items, namely water, wastewater and sanitation programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against diseases that are transmitted directly from the gastrointestinal tract.
A small disadvantage of hand washing is that repeated hand washing can cause skin damage by drying out the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin itching, commonly known as shingles or skin inflammation, among medical professionals.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of Obesity Disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times a day when hand washing with soap is critical to reduce waste and mouth disease: after using the bathroom (urine or kitchen), after cleaning the baby's bottom (change of diaper), before feeding the baby, before and after eating and before and after cooking or touching raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other occasions when hands should be washed properly to prevent disease transmission include: before and after handling a wound; after rubbing, coughing or cleaning the nose; after handling animal waste or animal restraint; and after touching trash crickets.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is low.
A 2015 study on handwashing in 54 countries found that 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap on average. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia has the highest rate, 97 percent; the United States has 77 percent; and China has the lowest rate, 23 percent. Many practices are changing the current practice to increase handwashing rates with soap in critical times.
The mandatory "health protection program" implemented by the education sector in the Philippines is an example of mass promotion of children's health and education.
The national program includes insect repellents twice a year, daily hand washing with soap, daily flossing with fluoride.
It has also been successfully applied in Indonesia.
The skin disinfection process has been improved by adding soap and detergents to water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce the dissolving barrier and increase the solubility.
Water alone is insufficient for skin cleansing because the organic soil components of starch and protein are not easily soluble in water.
Cleaning, however, is by means of proper water flow.
Solid soap, when reused, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
Some studies that have studied the transfer of bacteria from solid contaminated soap suggest that this cannot be done because the bacteria leave with the foam.
The CDC still says "liquid soap without hand control is a priority".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted among the health conscious.
There is no evidence yet that the use of recommended disinfectants produces antibiotic-resistant organic organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which is resistant to organic organisms.
So if antibacterial soaps don't choose antibiotic resistance, they won't be as effective as they're being said to be.
In addition to moisturizers and skin protection agents, the more sophisticated composite can be as a pH regulator, contain disinfectant-active benzene acids (acetic acid, scorbubic acid, lactic acid), and skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthal, plant parasites). According to a detailed analysis by the University of Oregon, School of Public Health, simple soaps are as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan that protect against bacteria and remove bacteria from the hands.
Hot water in hand-featured hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, natural oil, which absorbs soil and bacteria, is more effective at removing semi-hot, soapy water than cold soapy water.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies say that semi-hot water is not effective at reducing hand germs.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand sanitizer agent.
In the 1990s and early 21st century, water-based alcoholic hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, disinfectant hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most isopropyls are based on alcohols or ethanol mixed in a solid, such as a carbomer (a polymersal mixture of poly acetic acids) into a gelatinous substance or a moisturizing substance such as glycerin.
Adding oxygen to the soluble hydrogen increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer teasers with an alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective disinfectants.
Alcoholic breast-tissue agents kill bacteria, multi-drug immune bacteria (MRSA and VRE), TB, and some viruses (HIV, herpes, RSV, rhino viruses, vaccines, influenza, hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcoholic breast teasers containing 70% alcohol (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) kill %99.97 bacteria after 30 seconds of use and from %99.99 to %99.999 (log reduction of 4 to 5) after 1 minute of use. Hand-sneaked breast teasers are very effective for bacteria and less effective for a few other viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is almost completely ineffective against the neurovirus or Norwalk, the most common cause of small intestine infectious disease. Both hands should be treated with a high amount of disinfectant or alcohol.
Both the front and back of the hands and the middle and back of all fingers are to be stirred for about 30 seconds, until the material, foam or gel is dry.
Finger pores should also be thoroughly washed and rubbed on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends handwashing with a breast-popping teaser, especially when hands are exposed to contamination.
The rapid use of such materials is due to their ease of use and ability to kill germs quickly; however, they should not be considered an alternative to formal hand washing, and should be used when soap and water are not available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based breast teasers can dry out quickly, unless cream and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
Glycerin and/or other creams may be added to the formula to reduce or eliminate the drying effect of alcohol.
Clinical trials have shown that using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with cream reduces skin burning and dryness compared to soap or antimicrobial detergent.
Occasional allergies may occur in the event of a sudden illness or excessive sensitivity to alcohol or the presence of intoxicants in alcohol.
They tended to be less prone to inflammatory diseases than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, they cannot clean organic matter without water, they simply disinfect it.
That's why hand sanitizer is not as effective at preventing the spread of many germs as soap and water, because germs live on the hands.
The effectiveness of hand sanitizer is largely dependent on the ingredients and synthesis, and historically it hasn't been very effective.
In recent years, the syntheses that have used benzyl-conycloride have seen overall antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, and after repeated use, perhaps due to a reaction in the skin, its effectiveness has decreased.
In many low-income societies, people cannot buy soap and instead use ash or clay.
Ash and soil can only be more efficient than water, but less soap.
There is a risk that if soil or ash is contaminated by germs, it may increase the risk of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant because it forms an alkaline solution after mixing with water.
WHO recommends ash or soil in case of non-soap.
The proper hand washing procedures recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease include:
Wet your hands with running semi-hot or cold water.
Flowing water is recommended because standing water can be polluted, while water temperature does not matter.
Rub your hands with a reasonable amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the middle of your fingers and the bottom of your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and research has shown that people wash their hands better when they use soap instead of water.
Meet for at least 20 seconds.
The friction causes friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and more germs are removed than long friction.
Clean well with plenty of water.
Washing in a basin can re-contaminate your hands.
Clean with a dry towel or let the air dry.
Wet and damp hands can easily re-contaminate. Commonly abandoned areas include the thumbs, wrists, spaces between the fingers, and the sides of the nails.
Artificial nails and semi-subcutaneous nail polish can be a pathogen.
Moisturized lotions are usually recommended to protect the hands from dryness; dry skin can damage the skin, increasing the risk of infection transmission.
Where tap water and/or soap are not available, they can be provided with very low-cost facilities, such as pouring water from a hanging canister or logging plant with suitable holes, and/or using ash in developing countries if needed. In a situation where water supply is low (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions are available, such as "tippy-taps" or other low-cost methods.
Tipy-tap is a simple technique that involves a jig that is hung from a rope and a lever that moves with the feet that drives a little water over a hand and soap pad.
Effective hand drying is part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about what is the most effective way to dry in public toilets.
Most research suggests that paper towels are better than electric dryers, which are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium. It included paper towels, hot air hand dryers and modern jet air hand dryers for hygiene.
After hand washing and hand drying with a hot air dryer, the bacterial rate on finger donkeys increased by an average of 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Drying with jet air dryers resulted in a 42% increase in the bacterial rate on finger donkeys and 15% on palms.
After washing and drying with tissue paper, the total number of bacteria on the fingertips decreased by an average of 76 percent and on the palms by 77 percent. Scientists also tested whether all types of drying methods had the potential to contaminate other bathroom users and the bathroom environment.
A jet air dryer that discharges air from the unit at a claimed speed of 180m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of detoxifying hands and the unit and can contaminate other toilet users and the toilet environment up to 2 meters away.
A hot-air hand dryer can spread germs to a distance of 0.25 meters from the dryer.
In 2005, a study by TUV Produkt und Umwelt examined different methods of hand drying.
After drying the hands, the bacteria count changed as follows:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and dryer comparisons are made to paper towels.
Hand washing with sandpaper is an alternative in the absence of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based breast teasers contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing was made compulsory by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1846) after discovering its effectiveness in hospital environments.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to hospital staff to remind them to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Clinically, hand washing is for at least 15 seconds, using a significant amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hand.
And the fingers of the hands are joined together.
If there is a nail in the fingernails, a hard-haired brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in hand water, it is important to wash them well with water and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and if necessary to open the return door).
It will not contaminate hands again once they touch these surfaces.
Handwashing in healthcare settings is intended to remove and prevent the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms ("bacteria").
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that even in medical settings, handwashing rates are unacceptably low, with a large number of doctors and nurses who normally forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus becoming a means of transmitting germs.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other simple practices reduce urinary tract infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a paper that shows the right way to wash and touch hands in health.
The draft guidance on hand hygiene by the agency can be viewed for public comment on their website.
A related review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can test and validate hand hygiene, if such a procedure is required.
The World Health Organization has identified five "opportunities" for hand washing:
When faced with blood/body moisture
before the disinfection, and
After taking care of the patient -- adding a disinfectant to the soap -- the handwashing agent is used to disinfect the patient.
To "pull" your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching, washed with chlorhexidine or iodine, a disinfected towel to dry your hands after washing, a disinfected brush to rub, and another disinfected tool for cleaning your fingernails.
All jewelry is removed.
This involves washing hands from wrist to ankle, usually 6 to 2 minutes.
Long friction (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When the water is being poured into the middle of the arm, make sure it does not turn back toward the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with disinfected cloth and surgical gowns are worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash hands before and after seeing the patient or to apply disinfectants to the hands.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, research has shown that the greatest benefits of hand cleaning came from the first 20% washing, and that when this rate was increased to 35%, there was little added benefit.
In the study, the use of simple soap to treat bacterial infections was three times more effective than antibiotic soap. Comparing alcohol-based solutions and antibiotic soaps to 30 second hand rubbing each showed that hand rubbing with alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibiotic soap.
But soap and water are more effective at removing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores by hand than alcohol-based solutions. If hand hygiene is improved in health-related settings, it will require staff training for hand washing, availability of alcohol-based hand solutions, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
Further research is needed to determine which measures are more effective in different health settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered a low-cost, good health, and even good nutrition,
However, the lack of a constant supply of water, soap and handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a major challenge to embrace the global practice of handwashing.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, it is rare to have a hand-washing faucet near a private or public toilet, although hand-washing facilities can be built at very low cost.
However, a decrease in hand-washing rates may also be due to a lack of soap and water rather than a lack of habit maturity.
Promoting and promoting handwashing with soap can influence decision-making, raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing, and lead to far-reaching changes in population behavior.
Monitoring and testing are essential to make this effective.
A formal study of 70 students found that working in a particular community is more effective in LMICs, while social marketing marketing is less effective. One approach to handwashing in schools is a "three-star approach" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and low-cost measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene principles.
When the minimum standards are reached, schools can reach second and third stars.
Handwashing sites can be part of a handwashing campaign to reduce disease and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of this campaign raising awareness, aimed at changing behavior. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of handwashing emoji.
Some research has suggested that overall handwashing is less expensive than ignoring DALYs in developing countries.
However, one study found that it is less expensive to promote handwashing with soap than to manage water and its wastewater.
The importance of hand washing to human health - especially for those in unsafe situations, such as newborn mothers or hospital-injured soldiers - was first recognized by two leading hand hygiene physicians in the mid-19th century: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and the Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that the infection was caused by bad breath, or decay.
In 1980, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention further promoted intensive hand hygiene as a major means of preventing the spread of infection due to foodborne illness and public health infections.
The global outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and COVID-19 in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries that hand washing with soap is essential to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right hand-washing techniques" were hung in public toilets outside, in the toilets of office buildings, and at airports in Germany.
The saying "washing one's hands of" means that someone declares that they are not responsible for something or that they are not going to say anything.
The proverb is from the Bible in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate expressed disapproval of the decision to hang Jesus, but it later became a proverb in English-speaking society.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth finds herself forced to wash her hands in an attempt to clear a fictional stain, which reveals her conscience's disillusionment with the crime of murdering her husband.
It has also been found that people wash their hands more often than others after recalling or contemplating an immoral practice, and they place great importance on handwashing utensils.
Even worse, those who wash their hands after such thoughts are less likely to participate in other "cleaning" activities, such as volunteering.
Religions also recommend hand washing for hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, i.e. using soapless water to wash hands, is characteristic of many religions: for example, Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tu'la in Judaism, Nethil Yadīm, Lawabō in Christianity and Wa'ḍū Islam. Religions recommend hand washing according to hygiene, especially after certain activities.
Hand washing is a must after toilet use in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is a must before and after every meal.
Risk management in the workplace for COVID-19
Risk management in the workplace for COVID-19 refers to the implementation of occupational safety and health measures to prevent the risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper management of workplace risks depends on the workplace and nature of the workplace, exposure risk assessment, severity of illness in the community, and in workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other workers, for which basic measures to prevent infection are proposed, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing habits, and keeping the work environment clean and disinfected.
The middleground exposure risk is jobs that are in contact with people who are not known to be infected with COVID-19, but may be affected by social transfers and international travel.
This includes workers who are in touch with the public, such as in schools, in densely populated work environments and in large numbers of retail locations.
In addition to the basic precautions for infection prevention for the nest, the risk management includes high-efficiency air filters for air traffic, protection against leakage, and personal protective equipment if a COVID-19 infected person is exposed.
OSHA has considered the appearance of healthcare and mortuary workers in front of a person suffering or suspected of COVID-19 to be high risk, the exposure risk is high if workers perform aerosol-producing procedures or collect or handle samples from a known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Appropriate measures for managing the risk for these workers, such as negative air traffic pressure rooms, and personal protective equipment, will be taken by the nature of the work.
Many effects of the COVID-19 outbreak in the workplace are possible.
Workers may be absent due to the risk of illness, the safety of others, or the fear of exposure to illness.
Trading methods can change, depending on the demand for goods and also depending on the availability of those goods (such as shopping at low altitude times, or delivery or drive-through facilities).
Finally, geographically, the ordering of goods from heavily affected areas of COVID-19 can be disrupted. A plan to prepare and respond to infectious disease can be put in place to guide preventive actions.
Projects identify different levels of risk associated with workplaces and workplace tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and individual worker risk factors such as aging or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the control practices and emergency plans for the emerging pandemic situations that are necessary to address these threats.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be the subject of national or regional proposals.
Reducing staff transfers for pandemic response purposes, protecting those at risk from poor health complications, and reducing adverse impacts on business activities and supply chain.
The community in which the business is located affects the response to the severity of the disease.
The framework for risk management classification is widely used in occupational safety and health, to effectively manage group risks.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls will be established, followed by administrative controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
The controls designed are to isolate employees from work-related hazards, regardless of their behavior, and this may be the least costly solution to implement.
Administrative control refers to a change in work policies and procedures, which require action from the employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but can help prevent some manifestations.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risks posed to workers, properly installed, if applicable (e.g. balancing device), consistently and properly worn, regularly repaired and replaced, whatever is required, if properly removed, cleaned and stored or damaged to avoid pollution.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs are those with minimal professional contact with the public and other stakeholders.
The basic measures recommended for preventing infection in all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, breathing habits including mouth covering when coughing and sneezing, providing tissue and garbage, talking on the phone or arranging turn-in if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and tools, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace.
Identifying and isolating potentially infected persons is a critical step to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay home until fever, fever symptoms, or any other symptoms resolve for at least 24 hours without the use of fever or other symptom-relieving medications, and that sick leave policies be flexible, allowing employees to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of these policies.
Medium exposure risk, according to OSHA, is employment that requires close or continuous contact from people who are not known to be suspected or infected with COVID-19 at a distance of six feet (1.8 meters), but may be affected by community transmission around the business or SARS-CoV-2, or because the individual has recently travelled internationally where COVID-19 has been widely transmitted.
This includes workers with public contact, such as in schools, densely populated work environments and high-risk retail locations. To control these and more vulnerable groups, this includes installing high-performance air filters, increasing air traffic, installing plastic guards to prevent material obstacles such as spills, and installing drive-through windows to serve customers. For these and high-risk groups, management control refers to encouraging sick workers to stay at home, switching face-to-face meetings to virtual conversations, changing the way they work, requiring people to have access to non-COVID-19 epidemics, cancelling conversations, and providing personal information to customers, reducing the risks of COVID-19 and other workplace hazards, including hand-to-hand and hand-to-hand training, providing training, hand-to-hand washing and other necessary measures to protect workers from exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to exposure to COVID-19, providing training, training, and training, including hand-to-hand and hand-to-hand, and other measures to reduce the risks of personal contact, including hand-to-hand and hand-to-hand work, and protective equipment, including hand-to-home care and hand-to-care, and hand-care, and personal protective equipment that may be used for the use of personal use of personal protective equipment, including personal protective equipment, including personal protective equipment and protective equipment, including personal protective equipment, including hand-to-care and protective equipment, including personal protective equipment, including personal protective equipment for COVID-19 devices, and personal protective equipment.
The use of respirators is common among workers in this group of at-risk groups.
If an individual becomes ill on board an aircraft, appropriate control to protect workers and other passengers refers to keeping the sick person separated from others by 6 feet, allocating a member of the crew to the patient, and offering the sick person a face mask or telling the patient to cover his or her mouth and hands with tissue while coughing or sneezing.
When approaching an ill passenger or touching body moisture or potentially contaminated surfaces, the crew should wear disposable gloves and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough, or breathing difficulties.
For commercial vessels, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, the risk of travel being postponed in case of illness, and to inform the medical centre on board immediately if they are isolated and fever or other symptoms appear.
The key is that medical follow-up is in the patient's cabin. The CDC recommends temporary closures for schools and child care centers to ensure that if an infected person comes into the school building, even if they have not spread the virus, they are cleaned or disinfected.
When the virus is transmitted from small to medium-sized, social distancing strategies can be applied, such as outdoor activities, assemblies, and other large gatherings such as physical education or music classes, or cancelling meals in cafe areas, extending the distance between desks, limiting arrival and departure times, avoiding unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office for children with symptoms such as colds.
When there is a significant migration in the local community, social distancing strategies can also be considered in addition to long-term school closures. Law enforcement personnel who are carrying out their daily activities are considered to be less at risk to their immediate health, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact people with certain or suspected COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines for emergency technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the panic, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belts and gear using household cleaning spray or wipes before reuse, and follow standard implementation procedures for destroying and washing the PPE used and contained.
According to OSHA, some health care facilities and mortuary workers are at high or high risk of exposure.
Health delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers in high-risk jobs who are facing known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
They become highly exposed when workers take aerosol-making action, or collect or manage samples of known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
In the process of aerosol manufacture, the needle is inserted, the cough procedure is performed, the throat is examined, certain dental procedures and examinations are performed, or the sample is collected.
High-risk jobs in the mortuary include workers who produce the remains of people known or suspected of COVID-19 at the time of death; these risk groups include additional controls, including rooms reserved for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol manufacturing procedures are followed.
Some health centers and mortuaries may be suitable for special negative pressure air transportation devices.
Samples should be touched under biosecurity level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated in specific waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respiratory devices for those who work within 6 feet of a known patient or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patient, and those who perform aerosol-making operations.
In the United States, a comprehensive and authoritative respiratory safety program should include NIOSH-approved N95 respiratory filtering device or better, including appropriate testing, training and clinical trials.
Other types of respiratory devices can provide better protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend full coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and not a body moisture-borne disease.
WHO recommends surgical masks only at the entry screen for staff.
WHO recommends surgical masks, glasses, or face shields, gauntlets and gloves for those who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for or transporting COVID-19 patients without aerosol procedures.
If the aerosol-making procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Knowing that global delivery of PPE is inadequate, WHO telemedicine, material barriers such as clean windows, only allowing those who are directly caring for COVID-19 patients to enter the room, PPE use is essential for specific tasks, use of the same respiratory device without ventilation while caring for many patients with the same disease, monitoring and managing the supply chain of PPE, and discouraging the use of masks for people without symptoms.

[Covid-19] Weight loss and preparing for the future
Date and time of delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24UTC
CC0:: Rights not violated
We are facing extraordinary circumstances this month.
The global COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that humanity is globally connected and we have responsibilities to each other.
We have no prior example of such a challenge, but we know well that our best response is global empathy, collaboration, and social construction that flows through the spirit of this institution.
The feelings of friendship and attention that we've seen in all our fellow cars in emails, phone calls, and chats, all of which confirm how lucky we are to be working with amazing people.
I cannot be more grateful and proud that you are all my fellow carers.
Last week, someone complimented me on our work.
He reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia now, and how strongly it is for this delicate resource that everyone is online.
Your work has made this possible, whether you're with sites or our fellow car owners or our community is safe.
The world needs information, and Wikipedia provides it, now more than ever.
It's a moment when not only what we do, but how we do it, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some important changes from next week on how we work together.
Changes in our work and schedule
As Robyn previously expressed, the c-team met last night to discuss our vision and schedule for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we discussed what would be the most appropriate response to what we're facing and how to keep the organization on its feet at the time.
We wanted to put a long-term end to stress and advance our mission.
If you want to dial, fine.
All staff, contractors and workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about four hours a day, or 20 hours a week, so to speak.
We're not announcing a vacation - if you can work normal hours, the mission can get you in use.
However, there's nothing to be said about the world at this point, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, buy a deal, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not tracking your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
I don't need to say it, but we're saying it.
No sick days or PTO requirement - just tell your manager and help your team to update their calendar and schedule, making sure all aspects of the work are done.
(If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, notify Bryan within T&C Ops, T&C can help with support and ensure that the administration pays proper attention to your situation).
Friends who work by the hours will be paid in full.
We've said this before, and we're repeating our responsibilities to our contractors and our hourly staff.
Each person will be paid according to their hours of work during normal conditions.
This includes if you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll help you.
Many people work in the world around them to change their mental stress.
What we can do is incredibly rewarding, especially on days like this.
Again, this is all for your personal safety.
All we have to say is talk to your manager, we'll figure out what to expect from you, and then we'll make decisions accordingly.
A task is considered necessary.
There are some things we should keep going.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and fundraising teams (among others) work hard, which may require additional support.
We shift our focus with all sectors to evaluate recent goals and support what is important to our mission.
We all have a lot to do, we all focus on the most important projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us later.
We don't plan to "get it done" once the pandemic is over.
You're not expected to work overtime to meet deadlines, which is unrealistic at the moment.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and where appropriate, we will work to set new goals and timelines.
What made the AP (Annual Planning)?
To set our new reality and expectations for daily working hours, we intend to set our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
We intend to expand our 2019-2020 plan that takes longer to create a budget where workers are allowed to change their work priorities, and still have their loved ones in a position to accommodate those in need who want to work for a shorter time.
This extension of time will greatly reduce the current planning work and stress throughout the organization.
We will present our plan to the Board next week and inform the delegations and teams of the next step as soon as we receive confirmation.
Thank you for leading the APP team in this.
The office status, appearance, and cleanliness
In the past few weeks, we have heard that a friend of ours in SF may be infected with COVID-19.
However, despite the extreme caution, we have mobilized staff at our San Francisco office for an anti-virus operation to clear all surfaces.
They used a hospital-grade disinfectant to clean every surface with a braid and stairway arm that accessed our faces.
The building is using its own protocol products that are designed to protect its tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be in perfect condition at the time when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in VWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with all DC office staff members and seven of us.
Last week, our DC office moved to a remote location that is in compliance with the seven San Francisco Joint Guidelines.
As many of our NYC residents know, we're also in the process of renting a place in Brooklyn.
These conversations are ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working remotely for the first time.
Our old-time friends know that this could be an adjustment and they want to give you some advice.
The length of meetings may be extended to a maximum of one or two hours.
If you need long seats, think about how to distribute them on different days.
Make each meeting a clear agenda, and send the material first.
Default video, using seven features like Google Docs and Zoom for live collaboration and communication.
Lead the way in providing support for each meeting, one should oversee the discussion for questions and follow up the list of speakers and one should help take notes (or jointly note notes).
If you need a comfortable headset, email technical support.
Use your well-being allowance for snacks.
Join the #RemoteZ channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about shared work.
The HR Operations Team is considering webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support distributed car throughout the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all social benefits recipients to cancel all Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as Epidemics, until the World Health Organization declares an end to the pandemic.
They should be aware that we understand that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it possible to complete their accepted cooperation activities and that there will be no penalty for modifying or slowing down those objectives.
In the coming week, we will follow additional guidance on WikiMania and other regional and thematic social conferences.
The general feeling of the entire global community is saddened by this disruption but satisfied with the clear ability to focus on our own communities, Wikipedia, etc.
Moving forward, CRT is working on creating a webpage on MetaWiki to provide the community with the opportunity to track their seven communications and monitor their impact.
Stay in touch with COVID-19 related matters.
We will send your calendar an invitation to a special meeting next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to share up-to-date information, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're seven of them and we're going to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to get information and other necessary information about COVID-19 from this email on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep this page up to date and all other information in one place.
We are working to establish regular contacts with seven staff members who are currently living in countries that are significantly affected.
If you are traveling, attending events, having an important workflow, or having a coverage challenge or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to contact CRT and receive information.
We are here to provide the necessary support and communication.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, please email Brian Jodan, Director of Human Resources International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a departure from our duties and responsibilities.
Instead, they are a recognition at this point, where our work and responsibilities will have to be rolled out in a way that we have never seen before.
These are initiatives that we believe are essential to help each other so that we can continue to work, provide the support our movement needs and the service to the world they depend on.
When the time comes, our planned work will be there waiting for us.
From now on, helping one another requires time and taking time off for important work that will come in a few weeks, possibly months.
To do this, we need all of you, and that's why you all need to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be prepared in the best possible condition when needed.
Now, please, put your hands together and don't bite your face!
Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, AMV, Brian J. Dorian D, Gregory V, Jim V, Joel L, Lent L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the team leadership (Grant I, HeadW, Jim V, Jen Yu, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that binds to the outer surface of cells (cellular membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 makes it a reliable drug for treating heart disease by reducing the amount of ingoitensin II (ACE) and increasing the amount of ingoitensin (1-7) in competition. ACE2 also acts as an entry point for coronavirus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
Inguitensin-converting enzyme 2 is a type of zinc containing a metallonzyme found on the surface of the endothelial and in the rest of the cells.
The ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptide M2 domain and an extreme collector renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, with its unfolded active domain expressed on the cell surface in the lungs and other fibers.
The outer domain of ACE2 cells is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called shedase, and as a result the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream that is eventually excreted outward through the urine.
ACE2 is found in most organs: ACE2 is primarily associated with the type II lung-like facial cells, small intestinal intrites, arterial and vein-like endothelial cells, and arterial smooth muscle cells.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the outer membrane of the brain, the body's outer surface, the thumb down to the knee, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as the ACE counterbalance.
ACE inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor inhibitor
In turn, ACE2 carboxyl terminals separate the amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyze it to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also isolate a number of other peptides including [des-org 9] -brediquinine, apelin, neurotensin, denorphine A, and houselin.
ACE2 also controls the transport of the natural amino acid-carrying SLC6A19 membranes and is involved in brain dementia.
As a protein transgene, ACE2 acts as a central receptor in cells of several coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the fluctuation restriction on the enzyme domain of ACE2 at the cell level of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 proteins leads to the ingestion of cell membrane material from within a cell and the migration of both viruses and enzymes within cells.
This intervention process also requires the prioritization of the protein by the representative serine protease TMPRSS2, which is being inhibited as a potential treatment under current research. This has led some to conclude that a decrease in ACE2 levels in cells may make it easier to cope with the disease.
However, several professional societies and organizations have advised against the use of common ACE inhibitors and ARB therapies.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "ACE inhibitor use was associated with a 34 percent decrease in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, the risk of pneumonia B in patients treated with ACE inhibitors, who were at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and congestive heart failure, also decreased.
ACEs are also associated with decreased pneumonia-related deaths, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human transplants ACE2 (rhACE2) are being developed as an advanced treatment for severe hip injury, and it has been shown to improve hemodynamics and oxygen supply with lipopolysaccharide-like symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the action begins in 30 minutes, with a 24-hour duration.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be an improved drug for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor). Or in diseases where angiotensin II circulation is excessive - elevated rhACE2 emesis has been diagnosed during medical experiments to treat severe respiratory distress.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile applications that help to communicate during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who have been in contact with an affected individual seven times.
Several such applications have been created or proposed in several regions and districts with the support of the government.
Many applications have been developed to find connections.
Privacy concerns were raised, particularly regarding the system that allows the app user to locate the geographic location of the palace.
The low-invasive alternative involves using Bluetooth signals to transfer the user's location and well to other mobile phones.
Google and Apple jointly announced on April 10, 2020 that they will collaborate to integrate this type of Bluetooth-based applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with AliPay, has created an app that allows citizens to find out if they have been in contact with someone affected by COVID-19.
They are used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was created by a local IT community, which was released as an independent resource and will be referred to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app called "Stop Corona!" that can detect the proximity of potential victims and provide immediate response to health authorities.
The app is developed by the Ministry of Information and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government said on April 12 that the link-search app is in the next phase of development and will be available for launch within a week - with plans to launch a similar application ("StopCovid") in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering developing applications based on Singapore's TraceToGidder app and the Bluetooth protocol - Russia intends to introduce a geofencing app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients based in Moscow, to ensure people do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, has faced a number of potential practical difficulties in app-based systems, including the possibility of false positives and low effectiveness, if the use of the app is limited to a small segment of the population.
Dismissing concerns about the spread of a false or harmful "coronavirus" app, Apple has set limits on what types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to their app stores, limiting them to only "official" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also imposed similar restrictions.
Privacy pioneers have expressed concern about the countless monitoring restrictions on the coronavirus app, especially whether surveillance measures designed to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be removed once the threat is eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
These institutions have announced eight conditions on government projects:
Supervision should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
And the extension of surveillance should be for a certain period:
The use of data will be limited to the purpose of COVID-19 only;
Data protection and anonymity shall be protected and evidence-based protection shall be demonstrated;
Digital surveillance should be avoided by over-discrimination and neglect;
The data of a third party must be specified under the data sharing law;
Protective measures against abuse shall be taken and citizens shall have the right to respond to abuse;
The "relevant partners" will need meaningful participation, including public health experts and non-essential groups. The German Curiosity Computer Club (CCC) and Reporter Without Borders (Reporter Ohen Grenz) (RSF) also released watchlists.
Google/Apple's proposed plan aims to solve the problem of constant monitoring by removing the monitoring mechanism from its operating system device when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based caseload monitoring systems instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid surveillance.
In Israel, a network-based surveillance system was adopted.
Network-based solutions, which allow access to the raw data of the opportunity palace, have the potential to cause significant privacy issues.
However, all seven integrated systems of central servers do not require access to private location data; several privacy protection systems have been developed that use only central servers to alert each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to track contacts.
Instead of using a perfect application, the system collects surveillance information from a variety of sources, including mobile monitoring data and data exchange from the card, and collects them all to generate notifications via text messages for potentially affected individuals.
In addition to using this information, the government has made Sikas Mahal information publicly available to inform potential contacts, something that has been allowed due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws as the MERS outbreak in this country began.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites - countries like Germany have also considered both centralized and privacy protection systems.
Details were not released until April 6, 2020.
Privacy-protected connection monitoring is an improved concept, with considerable research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts in the group were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth-enabled energy (BLE) to allow users to access the palace from another mobile phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and it is not a single protocol. The decentralized protocol includes: decentralized privacy protection location monitoring (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN,fka event contact numbers, CEN), sensitive privacy protocols and procedures for mobile contact (PACT) and others.
These protocols do not allow identifiable personal data to be transferred from the device and all matches are on the device.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing secure pathways, a platform to use privacy protection techniques when collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The podcast is based on research by "Apps Gone Wrong: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is the SafeTrace Platform by EngaMPC, a privacy technology company originally founded at MIT Media Lab.
SafeTress uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of that data.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was founded by a group of individuals who came together with the same vision and who were largely overstepping the protocol to reduce dispersed disruption to enable surveillance and intelligence applications as a global interoperability, a key aspect of mass adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it has made the application used by its government, the Bluetooth Application, free-source.
On April 10, 2020, the companies controlling Android and iOS mobile platforms, Google and Apple, announced a move to track contacts, which they claim will protect privacy based on the compatibility of weak Bluetooth energy technology and security privacy encryption.
He also published specifications of the actual technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
The implementation of these protocols will enable governments to launch official privacy protection applications for coronavirus detection.
By directly integrating this functionality into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve these ongoing monitoring problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way when the threat is removed.
'Medicine replacement' (also called drug purpose change, re-profiling, function change or treatment change) is the modification or use of a drug approved to treat one disease, rather than the drug used for the disease for which it was originally developed.
This is an online scientific research that is currently underway to research effective and safe treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfer of healthy plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 medicinal proteins, each with multiple birth sites.
Analysis of these centrifugation sites provides an appropriate plan to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most prominent target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papine-like proteins, such as RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helix, S-protein and ADP ribophosphates.

Chlorine is an anti-malarial drug used for a few autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the World Health Organization announced that chlorokine and its seven hydrochlorokines would be among the four drugs to be studied in cohesive clinical trials.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York's official trials on chlorine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, FDR authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorine phosphate under an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA in clinical trials and is only approved for emergency use under the EUA for patients who are hospitalized but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of prophylaxis or SARS-CoV-2 disease, dosage, or duration" has not yet been determined.
Doctors say they use the drug when "no other option remains".

On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use it by the military in university hospitals, where it will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has overwhelmed the Trump administration in buying the drug - which may be less effective in cases of severe illness where the virus has already spread.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to become pregnant.
A study of lupinevir/retinovirus (Cletra), which is a mixture of antiviral lupinevir and retinovirus, concluded that it "was found to have no benefit".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from reproducing by binding to proteins.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicines to find a compound that would bind to proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The scientific community is criticizing the shift to resource-recycling drugs, particularly drugs developed for HIV/AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included Lupinvir/Retnavir in an international co-op trial.
Remedicivere was developed and promoted by Glade Science to prevent Ebola virus disease and treat Marburg virus diseases - and subsequently Glade Science immediately discovered that the remedicivere contained antiviral activity against multiple feline, fumo, paramexo and coronaviruses in the vein.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the increased resistance by mutations that can lead to more serious disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivor may have a high genetic disorder of resistance. Several such clinical trials, including two run by Cleveland University Hospital; one for people with mild and another for people with severe illnesses, are included.
For hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, there are three vitamin C intravenous trials; two relieving controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).

The B'A COVID-19 vaccine is a fake vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
While no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are several attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, a vaccine for the causal virus that will be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates will be in Phase I vaccine trials by April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak occurred worldwide, triggering significant investment and research activities in developing a vaccine.
Several agencies are using advertised lotion to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, it was said that the inevitable steps of the CEP to develop the vaccine are accelerating, developing the capabilities, deployment on a large scale and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that as of early 2020, 10 different technology platforms are in research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Phase I security studies include several major platform targets:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I vaccine developers and candidates: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I vaccine developers and candidates: ear synovial biology, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Melken Institute), and another 37 have announced but little public information is available about them (presumed to be in the planning stages or under development).
Phase I-II trials are preliminary safety and immunity checks, usually unconfigured, controlled by a non-toxic drug substance, and carried out at multiple sites, while determining more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and the effectiveness of vaccine testing for disease prevention, while monitoring adverse effects at maximum doses.
Of the 79 candidates for the vaccine in active development (certified by early April 2020), 74 were not yet diagnosable in humans (yet in "preclinical" research).
As of January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that could genetically modify viral proteins to boost an immune response.
On or about January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada announced that it will begin work on the vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
On January 26, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the University of Hong Kong announced plans to develop the vaccine.
As of January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, headed by Heinik Schutemaker, announced that they have started work on a vaccine.
Johnson is jointly developing an oral vaccine with seven of his biotech partners.
On 18 March 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced the participation of the Wexart Group as a manufacturer in the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the Onko Gene Laboratory in Romania published an article on the design of a vaccine that resembles the technology used in the treatment of cancer novantogen vaccine.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that he had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and that he was starting testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Genrix, No Genrix Immunoncology announced that it was launching a project to develop a LeKey peptide vaccine to fight COVID-19.
They want to develop a vaccine candidate that will be tested on humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced a vaccine development plan.
On March 5, 2020, the Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick, United States, and the Walter Red Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both located in Western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine development.
On March 10, 2020, Emergency Biosolutions announced that they had teamed up with the Navix company.
On the promotion and development of a vaccine.
The partners further announced plans for pre-clinical trials and a Phase I trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it is working with 11 isolated people and a fast-track that will take at least two and a half years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of particles such as coronavirus in part-co-operation with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The candidate vaccine is in laboratory research with a human trial planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered a "huge sum" to the CureRick for exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine, which the German government had protested against.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership to develop a vaccine based on seven joint MRNAs from German company BioNTech.
The candidate for the MRNA-based vaccine BNT162 is currently in preclinical trials with clinical trials expected to begin by April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, an Italian company, Taksis Biotech, announced that it will conduct preclinical trials by April 2020 and will begin human trials by autumn for its vaccine's final candidate.
In France on March 19, 2020, the Alliance for Epidemiological Innovation Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium comprising the Institut Pasteur, Thames Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of COVID-19 vaccines to US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Madera, Cory Walk, Innovative, Novavix, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started animal testing of several vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing self-developing RNA vaccines for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the order from the candidate China.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced funding of 275 million Canadian dollars for 96 research projects on COVID-19 antiretroviral medical issues, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced Canadian $192 million for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, including several new vaccines, to create a national "vaccine bank" that will be used when another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Petersburg Bridge School of Medicine reported experiments on pathogenic, which may be a potential COVID-19 virus in rats, saying that "MNA demonstrated strong antigen-related antibody response by the SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccine [in rats] that was clearly demonstrated 2 weeks after vaccination".
On April 16, 2020, in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced that it will design a DNA-based vaccine as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophysics, DNA will be designed to replicate harmless virus-like particles within human bacteria, which boosts the immune system against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, which will be collected from the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprises, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have other benefits besides the disease they want to avoid.
Another randomized trial in Australia involves enrolling 4,170 medical personnel.
It is possible that the vaccine will not be safe or effective during the development phase.
Initial research to test vaccine efficacy using specific animal samples of COVID-19, such as ACE2-species mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, identified the need for international coordination to directly address biosecurity level 3 measures to combat the virus, and to ensure standardised protection mechanisms.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS has been found to be safe and effective in humans.
And according to a research paper published in 2005, identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS has been a priority for governments and public institutions around the world.
When MERS arrived, it was believed that current SARS research would be a useful model in the development of treatments and vaccines against MERS-CoV.
By March 2020, there was one MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials on humans and three others were released, all vector-based viral vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus is known and that its vaccine is already available.
Patents featured in various social media posts point to current patents of gene sequences and vaccines and other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
B'Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe respiratory illness coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include diarrhea, pain in the ribs, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sleepiness, and abdominal pain.
The onset of symptoms usually takes five days but can last from two to fourteen days.
Although symptoms are often mild, some cases lead to viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported from 210 countries and regions, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been infected -- primarily the virus that is transmitted to people through close contact, often in the form of mouth-to-mouth drops when they're talking, sneezing, or talking.
Although these droplets are also released when exhaling, they often fall to the ground or floor, rather than spreading disease over long distances.
People can also get the disease by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with their hands after touching the affected surface.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours on the surface.
It is most commonly contagious within three days of onset of symptoms, although it can spread both before and after symptoms. The standard way to diagnose it is the time-reversed transcript polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) on behavior in anaesthetic patients.
The use of masks is advised to those who are suspected of being infected with the virus and those with health concerns.
There is a difference in the proposal to wear masks for the general public, some officials are against using them, some recommend using them and some are calling it necessary.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Most of the countries in all WHO regions have recorded local transmission of the disease.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or may experience symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, recurrent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue faces or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Symptoms of the upper respiratory tract can also be seen, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat.
Symptoms of gastrointestinal diseases such as smallpox, diarrhea and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
In China, initially, there were only a few cases of chest tension and intimidation.
In some cases, the disease can lead to pneumonia, organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to four days but can be as long as two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of being infected.
The exact number of these infected people without symptoms is not known; however, early evidence suggests they may be carrier.
The proportion of people with the disease who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases during hospital stay are without symptoms.
China's National Health Commission began counting symptomless cases in its daily cases on April 1; 130 (78%) of 166 affected patients were without symptoms at the time of the test.
Both the Tuvok and the Bulgam can be overloaded.
Speaking out loud can produce more drops than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that drops of khansi without dahanpe have the ability to go up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that biorosolic transmission may be possible and that viral RNA samples have been found to be positive in airborne collectors outside the individual's rooms.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can aerosolize respiratory moisture and can then spread to the air.
While there are concerns that it spreads from waste, the risk is now considered low; the virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; and if the virus spreads before symptoms appear, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person typically infects two to three people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be viable on paper one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for four hours.
However, it changes with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are effective if used properly; soap products disable the virus's corrosive protective layer, as well as clear the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzonium chloride and chlorohexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In one Hong Kong study, whooping cough was sampled on average within two days of hospitalization.
Of the six patients, five, the first sample had the highest viral load, and the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
The symptoms of severe respiratory distress are manifested by the severe novel respiratory disease coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which was first detected in three people in Wuhan with severe respiratory illnesses with pneumonia.
All the features of novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the corresponding coronavirus in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which ruptures its immune bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the original SARS-CoV.
The first organs are the most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses these host cells via angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the most common type II facial cell in the first.
To bind to ACE2, a specific level of glucose called "peplomer" is used by the leukemia virus and enters the host cell.
12% of those admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, had a severe heart attack and are more common in severe illness.
Heart disease is associated with higher rates of heart symptoms due to inflammation and disease throughout the body, but severe heart muscle injury in the heart may also be related to ACE2 stimulants.
2ACEs are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
Patients in the intensive care unit affected by COVID-19 saw higher incidences of arterial blood clots (31%) and thrombombombolism (25%) and may be associated with poor diagnosis. Long cell composed of pulmonary emptying (DAD) and subotic penetration were seen from postmortem deaths of COVID-19.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a turnaround for the appearance of ACE2 respiratory tract stem cells, severe COVID-19 patients have more than normal inflammatory symptoms affecting the body.
In particular, the use of sickening SM-CSF secreting T-cells in COVID-19 infected patients was linked to the use of suzoshi IL-6-derived unicellular cells and severe pulmonary emptying.
Long cell interference has also been reported in postmortem.
WHO has published several methods for testing the disease.
The standard method of experiments is the reverse transcription polymers chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in time.
Tests are usually performed on samples of respiratory moisture from artificial inhalation; however, nasal spray or sputum samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two samples every two weeks and the immediate significance of the results is diminished.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a variant of coronavirus and publish genetic sequencing so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infectious diseases caused by the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which indicates active infectious disease and whether or not a person has been infected in the past) was in the preparation stages, but is not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experiment showed only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The FDA approved the first care test center for end-of-month use in the United States on March 21, 2020. Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital issued diagnostic guidelines to detect the epidemic, taking into account medical characteristics and epidemic risk.
Early infectious disease is characterized by a bipartite, multi-cellular, ground glass opticitis with enveloped, inappropriate and later fragmented blurring.
As the disease progresses, full-blownness, crazy pumping (the thickness of the veil with a variable face like a balloon) and consistency may appear.
Some statistics are available on the microbial lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The following are the key voluntary results of the postmortem:
Microscopy: inflammation of the lung membrane, inflammation of the heart, lung stamina and inflammation of the lungs.
There are four types of viral pneumonia:
Light pneumonia: inflammation of the lungs, excess of the neumocytes, large abnormal neumocytes, inflammation with long cell penetration and the formation of multi-dimensional giant cells.
Severe pneumonia: reduced facial damage (DAD) with low facial inflammation.
Fear of DA is caused by the appearance of symptoms of severe respiratory distress (ARDS) and severe lack of oxygen in the body.
Sampling: organization of outward discharge in the oily cavities and pulmonary bichola endometriosis
Blood: blood clotting in veins (DIC); white and red blood responses.
Precautions to reduce the risk of disease include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water and washing for at least 20 seconds, maintaining improved respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when chewing or sneezing and using the inner part of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after a cough or a cough.
The CDC recommended wearing face coverings in crowds to limit the spread of the virus from people without symptoms. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups of victims by closing schools and offices, imposing travel restrictions and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distance guidelines also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away.
Since vaccines are not expected until before 2021, a key point in managing COVID-19 is to reduce the epidemic's highest level called "flattering the do".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are obviously dirty, before eating and after cleaning their noses, sneezing or peeling.
It further recommends that at least 60% alcohol-based hand sanitizers be used, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO creates two formulas for local production.
In these formations, antimicrobial activity is produced by ethanol and isopropanol.
Alcohol uses hydrogen peroxide to help kill bacterial eggs; it is "not an active agent for hand germs".
Glycerol is added as a solvent.
People are being managed with supportive care, including liquid therapy, oxygen support, and other vital organ support.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a simple mask.
Extracellular membrane oxygen (ECMO) has been used to address the respiratory obstruction problem, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and improved diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Assisted therapy can be used in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of the pandemic. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized people with COVID-19.
In the United States, patients and lung doctors have compiled a free resource, the IBCC, to receive treatment suggestions from various agencies.
As of April 2020, there was no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical experts have recommended paracetamol (methaminophen) as the main drug to replace abioprophen.
Precautions are necessary to minimize the risk of spread of the virus, especially in a medical setting when a medical procedure such as a duct or hand ventilation is being performed.
For medical personnel caring for COVID-19 infected individuals, the CDC recommends that in addition to general precautions, contact precautions and precautions for airborne germs, the person be placed in an airborne infection room (AIIR). The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the global pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: a PPE gauntlet, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. The respirator is preferred when available (rather than a face mask).
The N95 respirator is approved for industrial use but the FDA has only authorized the mask for emergency use under EUA.
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but do not guarantee their effectiveness against any specific unauthorized biological agent.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield or homemade mask as a last resort.
People infected with COVID-19 are often not so bad that they need mechanical anesthesia or alternatives, but a certain percentage of patients do.
The type of respiratory support in hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied, with some evidence that high-flow nasal ducts or bilateral positive airway pressure can avoid intravenous drainage.
They do not know that they share the same benefits with the seriously ill.
Some doctors prefer invasive machine paddling when available because this method limits the spread of haemorrhoids than high-flow nasal canopy. Severe disease is more common in older adults (in those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
The lack of adequate beds per capita in developed countries limits the capacity of the health system to handle the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who need hospitalization.
One study found that 5% of Chinese were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed machine ventilation, and 1.4% died.
30% of people infected with COVID-19 in China are eventually admitted to the intensive care unit.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated as COVID-19 increases severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Pressure-controlled modes and high PEEP-enabled ventilators need to maximize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of respiratory damage to the lungs and chest air.
There will be no more PEEP available on old ventilators.
Research for a potential treatment began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivor seems the most optimistic.
While it may take until 2021 for new drugs to develop, many drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in the advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe illness.
WHO recommends volunteers participate in potential treatment efficacy and safety experiments. FDA has authorized the experimental use of artificially recovered plasma in cases where a person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not undergone clinical studies to prove itself safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to stop the spread of the disease.
The user will be asked to enter his/her name and ID number.
The app can use surveillance data to identify "close contacts" and therefore the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential threat is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local medical officials. Mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and big data analytics on artificial intelligence are used to track victims and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are believed to be infected with the coronavirus.
The measures were taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who can contact affected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared the data collected from the mobile phone space with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
The Italian regional health authority said it was informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still walking around".
The German government held a 48-hour heathon on the weekend with 42,000 candidates.
Estonian President Christy Kajolyd also raised her voice internationally to seek creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may have difficulties due to quarantine, travel restrictions, adverse treatment effects or fear of the pandemic itself.
Citing Rory O'Connor, the BBC said, "Excess social distancing, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic distress are a complete disaster for the mental health and wellbeing of people in economic distress".
The disease may develop mildly with or without symptoms, similar to other common respiratory diseases such as fever.
Typically, patients recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or severe illnesses recover within three to six weeks.
Based on data from other viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may also be at a serious risk of COVID-19, but COVID-19 data is not available. In some people, COVID-19 affects the lungs that cause pneumonia.
In severely affected individuals, COVID-19 can rapidly transform into acute respiratory disease (ARDS) that can lead to respiratory failure, body mold or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include body mold, abnormal blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Abnormal blood clots, particularly in 6% of COVID-19 patients, were found to have a periodic increase in blood clots, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people affected by COVID-19 had an excessive amount of liver fibroids (transaminosis).
According to the same document, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were spent in hospital.
However, the average time of hospitalization and death among patients admitted to the intensive care unit was seven days.
In one study of early patients, the median time from the onset of early symptoms to death was 14 days, while the full sequence was six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Postmortem lung examination showed damage to the presence of air in the lungs due to the presence of a buildup of cell fibromyzoid in small oils.
Changes in viral cell disease have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lungs is similar to the symptoms of acute respiratory distress (ARDC).
According to China's National Health Commission, 11.8 percent of deaths were due to troponin or elevated cardiac activity.
According to the March U.S. Census, 89% of hospitalized patients already had some kind of disease. Availability of medical resources and the socioeconomics of the region could also affect mortality rates.
The estimated mortality rate varies due to regional variations, but it can also be due to difficulties in the methodology.
Low patient count can lead to higher mortality.
However, the fact that these deaths are the result of diseases that already affected him, means that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers had 1.4 times higher incidence of severe symptoms of COVID-19 and had 2.4 times higher need for intensive care or mortality rate than non-smokers.
Hong Kong hospital administration saw a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung examinations revealed organ damage.
This can lead to the appearance of extreme symptoms after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known that it has long-term immunity in people recovering from past pandemics.
Immunity is seen as potentially viable based on other coronavirus behaviours, but there have also been cases of positive coronavirus re-evaluations after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are believed to be worsened by prolonged infectious disease rather than recurrent infectious disease.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated as an animal-borne disease.
The exact source is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the pandemic was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in the Lancet in January 2020, shows that the first episode of symptoms occurred on December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first date of onset of the disease on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are usually taken to determine surgical deaths.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the number of tests, quality of health systems, treatment options, time from the onset of the epidemic to the present and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 to laboratory-verified SARS-CoV-2 epidemic deaths and U07.2 to medical or epidemic deaths from COVID-19 without laboratory-verified SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality and incidence ratio as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths in confirmed cases, and the epidemic mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of deaths in infected cases (confirmed and unconfirmed).
These figures are not for a specific time and cover a specific population from disease to resolution of the issue.
Although not all victims have antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people are affected.
Castelli di Ada, a small village of 4,600 in the heart of the epidemic in Italy, has already lost 80 (1.7%) of its population.
In Gangult, Catholic Christian festivals spread the disease, and spread to younger people, causing relatively low mortality rates, and not necessarily all deaths from COVID-19 not being classified in this way.
Moreover, the German health system was not defeated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of patients may have antibodies, as measured by blood donors.
69 people (0.004%) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact and mortality rate of the pandemic on men and women are different.
Studies in China and Italy show that men have higher mortality rates.
The greatest risk for men occurs after age 50, while the difference between men and women ends at only 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of this gender difference is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immunological variations, low smoking use in women and men, and the development of other diseases in men than women, such as high blood pressure in younger age, can increase the mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not yet found gender-related data for the COVID-19 pandemic.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high percentage of medical staff, especially nurses, are women, and they are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease has been "COVID-19".
WHO President Tetrodros Ahedanum Graves explained that COVID-19 refers to coronavirus, virus-like virus-like virus, disease-like D, and 19 refers to the day the first case occurred: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species, or group of people, taking into account international recommendations to prevent stigma. The virus that causes COVID-19 has been named SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 responsible virus" in public correspondence.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the early outbreak in Wuhan, China, both the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan virus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended nCoV-2019 and nCoV-2019 as the interim names for virus and disease, in line with the 2015 guidelines against using the name of the location in the name of disease and virus.
On 11 February 2020, the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released.
Due to the limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are renting out medical equipment such as nasal spraying and ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator valve, and the vendor was not able to deliver it in time, a local craftsman copied it and built the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the early spread of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misconceptions about the onset, duration, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
Humans can spread the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral development in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved for the treatment of the disease.
Research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched "Cohesion Experiments" to evaluate the effects of treatment with the four most effective existing antiviral compounds.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the same source to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine for the entire virus.
Using such a virus, whether dead or inactivated, will build an immediate immune system in the human body against the new COVID-19 disease.
Another strategy, the subcomponent vaccine, aims to develop a vaccine that will make the immune system sensitive to certain subcomponents of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the focus of such research is on the S-spike protein, which helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, the novel way to make vaccines).
The experimental vaccine developed from these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy - the first clinical trial of the vaccine was launched on March 16, 2020 on four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody dependency in vaccine development for SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested as a potential challenge, but it is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials are testing a drug that is already approved for treating malaria, including four studies of high-hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of Chinese research is re-prescribed antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials on remediciver reported in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review for candidates for COVID-19 vaccines has been in the works. Several existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are undergoing testing, including remediciver, chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine, lupenavir/retnoir and lupenavir/retnoir synthesized in combination with interferon beta.
As of March 2020, there is provisional evidence of efficacy from Remdesivir.
Clinical improvements were seen in patients treated with low-remediation.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorine, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied with preliminary results in February 2020.
However, we are raising the voices for a bridge review of research.
The medical authorities of Korea and China recommended the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, reminds us that double doses of the drug can be extremely dangerous and deadly.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorization for physicians who are engaged in treating patients with COVID-19, in their discretion, to use pyrohydrochloronoids and chlorokines. This 7th edition of China's guidelines for COVID-19 drugs include interferon, ribavirin or omefinoir.
Early data suggest that high amounts of robovirine are essential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 within an organism.
Nitasaxanide has been recommended for further veto studies after demonstrating low concentration in the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that early initiation of beta priming by trans-membrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry into SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with ACE2 receptors.
Chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine have major inhibitors in studies with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical community from accepting the treatment without further study. Oultameor does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of OVID-19.
Cytokine stroma can be a complication in the post-COVID-19 stages of severe.
Evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine is an anti-cytokinase strain. After completing a brief study, Toshilizumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by China's National Health Commission.
Italy is undergoing a nationwide phase 2 randomized trial after positive results in people with severe illness.
Joint serum ferritin blood tests to identify causative quinostromes are intended to counteract developments that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the steroid refractory cytokine release was approved by the FDA for the treatment of a disease that tends to have a different cause, called CART cell therapy, based on past-style studies of a misanthropic leukin-6 receptor competitor.
To date, there is no random, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Clean and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19, transferred to those who need it, are being researched as a passive vaccine-to-passive immunization vaccine.
This strategy was tested with unconfirmed results for SARS.
Viral neutralization is a predictable mechanism that inactivated antibody treatment may lead to defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other procedures, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or fungiocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of inactivated antibody therapy, for example, the use of a flavored monoclonal antibody, are being worked on.
The production of healthy fluids, which are a liquid component of healthy patients' blood and contain specific antibodies to the virus, can be prepared for use early.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenling, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was infected and died from COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
