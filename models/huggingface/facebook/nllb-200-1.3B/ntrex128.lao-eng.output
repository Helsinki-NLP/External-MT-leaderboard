Members of the council worried about 'looking like a robot'
There was a bit of a backlash amongst her fellow MPs against the suggestion that their names should be changed to MWPs.
It was due to the plan to rename the parliament to the Time Parliament.
Members of parliament from various political groups were concerned that it would cause a stir.
One Labour MP said his group was worried "it would turn up with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of time: in time language twp means fool and pwp means debt.
Member Plaid said the group was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative solutions.
The conservatives in the council said his group was "open" about the name change, but acknowledged it was an acronym from MWP to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire pronunciation in English of the letter u.
The parliamentary committee, which is now drafting legislation to propose the name change, said: "The final decision on what to call the parliamentarians is of course up to the parliamentarians themselves".
The 2017 Wave Government Act gives the Wave Council the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on a proposal which was widely supported to call the Parliament a parliament.
In terms of MPs, the committee preferred to be referred to as WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
Lawmakers have announced that they are proposing alternatives, but trying to reach a majority could be a headache for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the council works, including rules on disqualification of councillors and the design of the committee system.
Members of Congress will get the final vote on what to call them when they define the bill.
Macedonia holds referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The top vote was created to try to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, whose province is named Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbor indicates a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Former Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who was opposed to the referendum on the name change, has said he would not be interested in the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that simply changing the name is the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The monastery of St. Martin's is silent as the church in Harlem is in a state of shock.
"In the past, the elders I spoke to said that there were bars and churches everywhere", says Adams.
"Today, there is none".
He said that the disappearance of the bar was understandable.
"People synthesize differently these days", he said.
"It's not a playroom in the suburbs where people go to play anymore".
For the church, he was worried that the money from the sale of the property would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and soon they would be back where they started".
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings along with condos filled with people who would not help the remaining shelters of the neighborhood.
He said that "the vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white", "and so I'm going to rush to the point where these churches are closed down because it's unlikely that most of these people who move into these condos will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin's in the following decade.
A gathering of white Methodist immigrants in the 1930s.
The crowds of black people who worship nearby took over the building's board.
St. Martin's was taken over by a mob of black people under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led a crackdown on the retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged, but when the church of St. John's planned to rebuild, they arranged for a blockade.
The Abbey of David Johnson, the son of the Abbey of Johnson and heir to the title in St. Martin's, called the monastery the "Poverty Abbey".
Experts who struck the collection in July called it by different names: "cultural treasure" and "irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, a specialist at the University of Michigan, added that it was the first concert series in the world to be staged by the violinist Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger concert series at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's in the last few months is a mythological mix of architects and tenants, some brought in by the ordinary clergy of the church, others brought in by the jurisdiction of the monks.
The Church Commission, a district governing body composed of lay leaders, wrote to the district governor in July with concerns that the district would seek to tell the church commission about the further costs to the church commission, which is not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the district.
Some churchgoers complained about the transparency in the governor's area.
A shark kills a 13-year-old boy while swimming in a California mangrove swamp.
Officials say the fish attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was swimming in a canoe in California, which is the opening day of the canoeing season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with his friend for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then jumped the boat with a group of people to help him out of the water.
Hammel says at first he thought it was just the excitement that caught the kangaroo, but then he realized he was screaming, "I got bit!"
I was bitten!
"All his shoulder blades were torn off". Hammel said of what he noticed as soon as he reached the boy.
I shouted at everyone coming out of the water: "There are fish in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he was listed in critical condition.
The species of fish that caused this attack is unknown.
Rescue team chief Larry Giles said during a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not listed as an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim suffered painful injuries to his upper abdominal region.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and for security purposes.
Giles states that there are over 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered endangered.
Sainbury's plan pushed the UK beauty market.
Sainbury is starting Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams along with a beauty shop with a walk-through in the form of a flatbed with specialist assistants.
As part of a major push into the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market which continues to grow as home fashion and accessories sales decline, the larger beauty store will be piloted with 11 stores nationwide and more stores next year if it proves successful.
Investing in beauty becomes looking to supermarkets for a way to save money when charged for phones, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainbury's says it will scale up to 3,000 times its products including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The range available from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burts Bee will have more space with a space with merchandise cards similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The market also opens up to more boutique make-up to make most products vegan-friendly as something that smaller shoppers want more of.
The fragrance retailer will also be piloting in two Sainsbury's stores with the first opening in Croydon, south London, over the weekend, while another opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, at the end of last year.
Online shopping and the shift to smaller daily groceries at local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to work harder to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said the store will look more like a department store as the supermarket chain tries to battle discount providers Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has installed Argos in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of residential sources since purchasing both stores two years ago, which have turned retail sales and generated more profits.
Supermarkets' attempts to reform their beauty and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's experimented with investing with Boots in the early 2000s, but the tie-up ended after a dispute to separate the revenue from the supermarket pharmacy.
The new strategy emerged from Sainsbury's sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, who owns Lloyda Pharmacy for £125 million, in the last three years.
Lloyds was told to play a role in the plan by expanding the range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We are changing the look and feel of the street for our own beauty and improving the environment for our customers".
We also invested with colleagues who have been through special training who will be waiting for guidance.
Our brand range has been designed to fit every need and the unique environment and convenience of the desert where we now become an attractive destination that challenges the old-fashioned surf.
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby cancels £11 million contract
Peter Jones of Dragons Dens left in a fit of rage after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifetime business brand in favour of his new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, a brand of household goods and jewelry.
Their business is like Gwyneth Paltrow's Brand Goop.
The 37-year-old presenter of This Morning posted on Instagram to announce his resignation.
Holly Willoughby left, and Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, was so angry that he cancelled his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was upset when the TV star admitted during a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire about his new contract worth more than £1.5 million which meant he would no longer have time to devote to Truly, their home appliances and jewellery brand.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and doubled Wiloughby's fortune by around £11 million.
When 37-year-old Wiloughby posted on Instagram to announce he was resigning from Truly, Jones rode out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly has been Holly's top priority so far.
It's going to be a long-term future to see him in the next few decades.
His decision to resign really embarrassed everyone involved.
No one knows what happened on Tuesday, it's very close to the new launch.
There is a warehouse full of merchandise at the Marlow base which is ready for sale.
Experts believe the resignation of the presenter of This Morning, the richest British billionaire, could cost the company millions due to massive investment in a range of products from banknotes and coins to clothing and home appliances and infrastructure for the next launch.
And it could mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Willoughby's mother of three and husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for decades.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, a 52-year-old man, joined as chairman in March.
The couple vacationed together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said tonight, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
A violent conversation and then we fell in love.
He spoke bluntly about the criticism he would receive from the media for expressing what some consider to be un-President views and for thinking positively of the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so accepting?
Trump speaks with the voice of his island news anchor.
I don't agree with anything.
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised the first meeting in Singapore in June as a great step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks were stalled.
For more than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong-Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "concerted response" from the United States to North Korea's initial disarmament.
On the contrary, he added that the US is pushing for a coercive approach by ensuring pressure.
Trump expressed a more positive outlook in his rally speech.
He said, "We are doing well with North Korea".
We're going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people will be killed.
We have a very good relationship with them now.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have led to very positive responses, such as the suspension of the inspection, the release of hostages and the return of the bodies of American soldiers.
And he defends his weird way of discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded stadium, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
The tsunami in Indonesia and the earthquake that devastated an island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign private entities were said to be unwanted.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, there was no national disaster alert, which is a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
Sumbung said that unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear that they were not asking for international help, so it was a bit challenging.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign officials will be able to work in the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Unit, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international units would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
As earthquakes occur in Indonesia all the time, the country is still unprepared for the tragic calamities of nature.
While building a shelter for the Aceh nomads, they were not visible to the general public from the other shore.
The lack of tsunami warning in Palu despite the warning caused deaths.
During the best of times, inter-island travel is considered challenging by many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make transportation more difficult.
A hospital ship operating in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo upgraded Indonesia's devastated infrastructure for his election campaign and spent large sums on roads and railways.
But a lack of funding has caused problems in Joko's administration, which faces a new election next year.
Joko also faced pressure from anger over the fragmentation of Indonesia's parties, with the majority Muslim members adopting a conservative stance.
More than 1,000 people were killed and 10 out of 1,000 were separated from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought each other in the streets, using knives, grenades and mortars, and other weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool into the deep end against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge kept Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier Leauge with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a delivery from Xherdan Shaqiri while 30 yards from Chelsea's door as his team led 1-0.
He slowly kicked the ball to his left hand before shooting the ball into the far corner of the door.
The balls fly high above the penalty area as they glide into the top right corner of the screen.
The ball eventually slipped past Kepa Arrizabalaga who was jumping and fell into the net.
"It's just trying to get in that position, to get the ball and players like Shaq play as much as possible in the front, and then I try to make as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante running and needed a move and didn't think much about it and just decided to shoot the baby.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a 25th-minute goal from Danish striker Eden Hazard.
The Blues' shooter used a kickback to Mateo Kovacic in that match before shooting from midfield and running fast into Liverpool's territory.
Kovacic receives the ball and passes it quickly from the center.
He then kicked a beautiful shot which led Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard ran through the opposition and shot with his left foot into the far corner of the field through Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The National Disaster Unit said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Many people are reportedly still trapped in buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused a 20-foot high sea wave, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the unit, said in a press release.
Palu, a city of over 380,000 people, was scattered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
A murder investigation has begun following the discovery of the woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old victim was discovered at 7.55am with stab wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, along with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged the people in the area to come out and report anything they saw or heard.
Police detective Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages but I would urge anyone in the John Street neighbourhood in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers who may have any recordings in their cars to contact us because they may have information that is very important to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the body of the woman who was discovered was a local in Birkenhead and he was found in a hotel.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire about the location of her discovery this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police said they are in the process of notifying relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He didn't say anything when he knew what was happening.
The residents were told to wait several hours before they were allowed to return.
The police officer told one man that the whole area was now seen as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene with tears.
He kept saying, "It's very cruel".
At 2pm there were two police vans on the road in the police precinct with another van outside.
Several officers stood in the police circle to observe the rented room.
Anyone with information can send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers secretly on 0800 555 111 with a reference to the 247 incident record of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest manifestation of the paradox of historical re-writing.
The removal of the statue would be in response to his massive destruction of British cultural and religious art, as the Taliban did by his strict Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society dismissed Crick's proposal as "nonsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is inevitable in the current debate about moving statues away that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will become a target.
The destruction of the English Civil War monument was not an order or an operation of Cromwell.
Sometimes Cromwell would sacrifice himself for the actions of his ancestors, who were Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to the 19th century opinion and part of the history of the individual's life that everyone believes is still worthy of praise.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was respected by many who sometimes in the late 19th century had more than now to defend Parliament against external pressure in his case as a democrat.
There has been ongoing debate over whether or not it was a fully legitimate protest.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century set the course for the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a memorable figure who represented one side of that division.
His success as a shepherd deserves both praise and instruction.
The chicken bites the Chinese farmer to death.
A flea in a market in southwest China attacked and killed a farmer, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his initials Yuan, was found dead with a missing, blood-stained collarbone near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the Souther China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A rice farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a rice barn on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
It is reported that he traveled with his nephews from Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 of them at the market.
Early the next morning, his brothers found him dead and found the door of the pigsty unlocked.
He said that in the pigs' cage there was a large cat with blood in its mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that 550 heavy cows bit the farmer to death, according to reports.
"My cousin's leg was covered in blood and partially missing", said the cousin, who is nicknamed Wu, as reported by Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV video showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed pigs.
His body was found hours later.
The animal that killed him was not Yuan's or his nephew's.
The market manager told local news that the pig was being held to prevent other people from harming her, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating a death penalty for his death.
However, it is a rare case that rats have damaged human bodies as previously documented.
In 2016, a wolf attacked a woman and her husband at their own farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with severe injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound spider hit a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was fed his own pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC that the pigs normally do not thrive but that the taste of the blood can be a "trigger".
They just like yoke.
They're very shy and curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to show them the right respect", he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa have caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
According to weather reports, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves through the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in a matter of days.
Rosa had winds of 85 mph, becoming a Category 1 hurricane by 5 a.m. on Sunday in the Eastern Time Zone and located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure area began to form in the northern Pacific Ocean and move eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approached the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it would begin to push tropical moisture deeper north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will produce maximum rainfall of 10 inches over Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture that is interacting with the approaching low pressure zone will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in a few days.
In local areas, rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden flooding, debris spills and potentially earthquake hazards in desert areas.
Tropical moisture will cause rainfall rates as high as 2 to 3 inches per hour there, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Heavy rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in the southwest, especially in Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur in conditions that are rapidly eroding because rainfall in the tropics is of a diffuse nature.
It is not advisable to risk walking in the desert with the dangers of tropical rain.
The heavy rain can turn the sand into rivers of violent waves, and the heavy rain can cause winds to blow up the sand.
The approaching low pressure trough will bring heavy local rainfall to the southern California coast.
Rainfall in excess of half an inch is possible, which may negate minor road flows.
This is probably the first area where it rains in their rainy season.
Some rain started to pour into Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before it was even more covering on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain and scattered over the Four Corners on Tuesday and into Wednesday.
In October, extreme temperature instability can be seen across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain warm due to the humidity.
Sometimes this has led to large changes in the climate in a short period of time.
There is a good example of a large temperature difference across the central United States on Sundays.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In a few days, the ever-warmer summer heat will try to build and expand again.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to see a warm start until October with coverage at 80°F from the Souther Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City can get to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which will be about 10 degrees on average.
Our long-term weather data indicate a high chance for higher than average temperatures for the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial.
More than 20 million people tuned in to the six-hour interview by Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday and the woman who accused him of harassment, which occurred in 1980, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political controversy continues with a last-minute Friday preparedness: an agreement issued by Arizona Sen to give Jeff Flake of the FBI a week to investigate.
Ford testified to the jury that the female witness was 100 percent confident that Kavanaugh raped and tried to fix a drunken girl at a high school prom.
Kavanaugh said with enthusiasm that he was 100 percent sure that no such incident had occurred.
It's like more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen ratings on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of the show through CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNC.
Some cameras have not given the number of viewers, such as PBS, C-SPAN and The Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen has difficulty measuring who is watching from the office on a regular basis.
To understand the perspective of a large audience, as large as the audience at a football semi-final or the Oscars.
Nielsen interviewed Fox News Channel owners who were in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination, giving each channel an average of 5.69 million viewers as of the morning's hearing.
ABC is the second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million subscribers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
There's still a lot of interest even after the trial is over.
Flake was a key figure in Friday's events.
After passing the U.S. officials' hearing, which issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught shouting at protesters Friday morning from CNN and CBS cameras as he tried to climb up to the jury trial.
He stood with his eyes closed for several minutes as he was shot through a live CNN video.
One woman said, "I'm standing in front of you right now".
"Do you think he's really telling the truth to the whole nation?
He said, "You have a power that most women don't have".
Flake said his office had orders and said before the window closed: "He has something to say about the committee's consideration".
All cable and broadcast networks went live hours later when the judges voted Kavanaugh's nomination out of all the votes cast by the members of Congress.
But Flake said he would do so if he understood that the FBI would investigate the nominated charges within weeks, the officials said, as the minority populace pushed for the bill.
Flake was inspired in part by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Congressman Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several members of Congress, Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice is powerful because the American people will not vote for Kavanaugh's acquittal without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
The UK Prime Minister says critics are 'playing politics' over Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May said her critics were planning to leave the European Union in a "political game" with Britain's future and where the national interest was being undermined in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to attend the Conservative Party conference in Brimmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview taken from the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked his so-called "Brexit Wheat Plan", referring to the proposal that the UK and the EU should tax each other which is "crudely abnormal".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dyteon Simpson in the death of LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU volleyball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police said.
An official video of Sims and Simpson's face-to-face encounter has been released, and police officials say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police removed the glasses from the scene and said they found Simson's DNA there, WAFB reports on CBS Group.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to being a woman in the shooting at Wayde.
His wallet is set at $350,000, from the lawyer's report.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Mortuary Center released a preliminary report Friday, that the cause of death was a short-barreled shotgun wound to the head and neck.
The department is urging Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit officers, the State Police Crime Prevention Office, the Southern Police Academy and local citizens to assist in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva said he was grateful for law enforcement on the ground for "nonviolence and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
His jump averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's tournament.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach said the team was "saddened" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"Is this what you're worried about all the time?" said Wade.
Volcanoes have burned ash in Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Management Center warned Maxicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after detecting activity around the mouth of the volcano, which produced 183 gas canisters and ash for 24 hours.
The unit checked several alarm and commotion points.
Images on social media showed some layers of rubber that almost covered the front of cars in neighborhoods of Maxico such as Xochilco.
Physicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico City in September 2017.
The volcano named "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday, after protesters clashed with traffic police, and thousands of people joined the protest to mark the first round of voting in the same direction in Catalonia.
The group of hunters in the land division were arrested by the traffic police with eggs and powdered paint, creating a black cloud of dust on the roads which caused permanent damage to tourists.
The riots continued to cause damage the next day as police used grenades into the fight.
Throughout the hours the independence protesters chanted "don't forget, don't forgive", facing a group of union members who protested "let Spain go".
A total of 14 people were treated for minor injuries in the protests, local news reports said.
Protests remained high in the autonomous region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters chose to be largely independent, although the output was low compared to most secessionists who were doing voting stakes.
According to Catalan officials, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after an incident in which police officers tried to stop an upcoming election at polling stations across the mountain with violence.
The Independent group camped all night on Friday to prevent protests in support of the National Police.
The protests continued but were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the land-sharing protest with his wife, said: "He no longer hopes for the chance to see independence in Catalonia".
"Years ago we lived in the best of times.
I made my parents cry with joy that we could choose, but now we have to settle down", he said.
Despite a significant but lopsided victory in last December's election, the Catalan Liberation Party has been on a long-term hold from the movement this year with many of its most prominent leaders either self-exile or detention awaiting proof for their role in the referendum and then declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old architect who recorded the protest in support of his police cell phone, said the clashes originated from politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more intense", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Confirming myself as a candidate for the European Parliament is the best way to tell him about the backwardness in democratic values and the pressure we see from the Spanish government", he said.
A young man was arrested after his house was hit by a car.
Three young men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car hit a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, at 19:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused by the doors and the building.
The car may have been pulled out of some point of the car.
Menga's attack gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
The first goal from Dolly Menga won Livingston.
Livingston was promoted and the Rangers were shocked to see Steven Gerrard out for the second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's retirement proved to be a difference as Gary Holt also made a step up with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side remained by far from winning this season's Premiership and face the heart-to-heart leader, who he still has eight points behind next Sunday.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna of the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile at Livingston, they expanded their squad in the six-game division, with head coach Holt still throwing a taste of the sickness since replacing Kenny Miler the previous month.
Livingston missed an opportunity to fight the Invisible Visitors.
Holt's team would go a long way before they could shoot the door, with their intent to make the Rangees trouble at all.
Scott Robinson reached but was dragged to the goal, so Alan Lithgow managed to control his penetration attempt which came in front of Craig Halkett causing him to shoot across the goal.
The hosts were intent on letting the Rangers play their way, as they knew the Rangers might cause trouble to the fans.
And that's where the big goals come in.
Rangers accepted the free-kick and Livingston as the opener, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joining to arrange Menga, who interacted and scored from the center of the field.
At that stage, the Rangers had the ball but the defensive foul from the home side made it impossible to pass and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly uninjured.
That format remained in use into the later half, even though Alfredo Morelos was forced to record from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was kicked by goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow bounced off Livingston's other set.
The cut continued into Livingston's area and continued to manage while there were two penalties from Glenn Middleton's challenge and another one caused by the ball being in the player's hands.
'The Appearance' from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland correspondent Alasdair Lamont in the area of Tony Macaroni.
Showcases and results for Livingston.
For the young, they've been very successful, they've gone beyond expectations on this progressive path.
Their playing style and tackling have remained unchanged since they returned from the first flight, but the good way is to have Holt lifted because he has disappointed his team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
With Tan Halkett once great, there was a great defensive arrangement, but in the meantime Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worral with their team.
Although the Rangers are always short of motivation.
And it's good that they had that time under Gerrard, they felt they lacked those standards.
Their last ball was a foul-on - the only time they cut a side open side-house and it was something of a shock for Rangers to find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne.
There were both swings and a blue sky on Saturday (September 29) as the captains of the Turkey and Germany teams met at Breakast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to the disputed point in Germany - which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have a variety of issues including human rights, freedom of assembly and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan is heading to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent the 25,000-strong crowd from rallying in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters appeared nearby to celebrate their country's independence.
Hundreds of Kurdish-speaking anti-Erdogan protesters also heard voices condemning Erdogan's police policies and the German government's decision to allow them into the country.
The one-on-one protests reflected the division of the guests being hailed as heroes by some German Turks and criticized by others as dictators.
Deptford Street Accident: A cyclist was killed when he was hit by a bus.
A cyclist died in a collision with a bus in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, in the south-east of the city at 10:15 BTS.
The driver stopped and called the doctor, but the young man died instantly.
The accident came months after another cyclist died from a collision on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and let his relatives know.
There are roadblocks and buses in the area and drivers should be advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were unusually injured.
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at a high-security male inmate detention center, prison officials said.
The anomaly occurred at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Saturday and continued to occur.
Special agent "Tornado" was brought in to handle the incident, which involved all eight inmates and left them winging it out.
The officer was treated for minor injuries to his face.
A prison spokesman said: "Prison officers have been specially trained to deal with the incident that occurred at HMP Long Lartin".
Six members of the police force were treated for injuries.
We tolerate violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend more time in custody.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including those who committed crimes in some countries.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was admitted to hospital due to being abused by prisoners.
And in October of last year, anti-riot officers were called to the prison to deal with a violent riot in which officers were attacked with a grain ball in a swimming pool.
Within the hurricane Rosa has hit Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden disaster (dry areas may be useful)
It is unlikely that a tropical depression will hit Arizona, but it is likely to do so early next week as the remaining Rosa has diverted power across the southwest desert, creating a sudden flood risk.
The National Meteorological Administration declared a state of emergency on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move through Phoenix on Monday, which is approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Center reports that only "10 tropical cyclones have sustained tropical cyclones or low tides within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!.
Katrina (1967) is a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center's latest forecast is 2-4 inches of rain, possibly as high as 6 inches in Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
In other areas of the southwest in the desert including the central Rockies and the Grat Basin, it is likely to be 1-2 inches with a possibility of up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of sudden flooding from the torrential rains of Hurricane Rosa, it may be a blessing given the arid terrain.
Although flooding will be a serious problem, some rainfall may be useful as the southwest is facing drought.
In the United States, drought surveys cover more than 40% of Arizona, but it is experiencing the second-highest drought category". weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will wind its way to the mainland across the Gulf of Baja California in Mexico.
Rosa, a strong hurricane, remained strong Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia Mexico and moving southward at 12 mph.
The storm was facing the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, so it weakened.
A tropical storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico on Monday afternoon or afternoon.
Some rainfall in Mexico may be too heavy to pose a flood risk.
The forecast for total rainfall of 3-6 inches from Baja California in the northeastern region of Sonora is likely to be as high as 10 inches".
Rosa would then follow northward into Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Monday morning as a tropical depression which would follow up through Arizona and into southern Utah on Monday night.
"The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest and the southwest United States in the desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause sudden flooding and are harmful to marine life in the deserts and deserts of mountainous countries.
Midsomer Naton attack: Attempted to capture four killers.
Three teenage boys and a young man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed at Sometset Row.
Three teenage boys were injured in the Exelsior ward of Midsomer Norton at 04:00 on Saturday BST.
They were taken to hospital where they are still in normal condition.
Two 17-year-olds, an 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, police said.
Police are asking for the cooperation of anyone who may have video to see what might happen in the future.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the wrath of the Democratic Party.
The vote for Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's foolish and cruel policies", Trump said in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been "poor, angry" with the Democrats throughout the negotiations.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly denying allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that she molested him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at his indictment trial.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's genius, quality and courage" that day.
"Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most successful legal arguments of our time that has a service record", he told the crowd supported by West Virginia.
The president spoke highly of Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of public in the election.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
"I'm not doing it to actually vote, but I'm doing it", he said.
That's why I'm everywhere where there's a fight for good unity.
Trump argued that Democrats were on a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first round of voting is critical to the caucus in Congress on Kavanaugh's nomination expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia with deaths rising.
At least 384 people were killed, many stranded, when an earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, officials said Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate on the coast of Palu on Friday when a wave of up to 6 meters (18 feet) was blasted onto the beach in the afternoon, leaving many dead.
After the tsunami, it brought a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami hit yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and not immediately running away and becoming trapped", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief unit, told reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it washed away cars, logs, cottages and everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before it hit the coast.
Others climbed trees to escape the torrent, as Jesus had said.
About 16,700 people have been displaced to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Damage Unit found several buildings and shops destroyed, bridges clogged and dirty and the mosque itself surrounded by water.
The earthquake continued to shake around the coastal city on Saturday.
The story of the earthquake caused a sensation in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau of Perspectives and Technology (BPPT) said the magnitude of the earthquake released on Friday was about 200 times the magnitude of the nuclear bomb dropped in HIroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located at the tip of a narrow and long bay, may increase the size of the tidal wave.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said more than a thousand homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were damaged.
Some remains were found under the rubble of the building, he said, with 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could build up along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, the area known as Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "have been completely shut down without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there", the National Assembly said in a statement, adding that officials and volunteers were heading to the affected area.
"This is a tragedy, but it could be much worse", is a common saying.
The unit on Saturday was widely criticized for not having been informed of any Palu invasion, although officials would say the wave came within the time the warning was issued.
In a video posted on social media, a man on the roof of a building can be heard loudly warning of a tsunami approaching people on the roads below.
Within minutes, a wall of water slammed into the shore, submerging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a blaze which cut off communications around Palu causing difficulties in coordinating relief officials.
The military began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, adding that the refugees still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been opened for cargo only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the refugee center in Palu on Monday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's a very sad story.
As World Vision officials from Donggala headed to Palu, where the workers were hiding in the waterproofing shelter of their offices, which they had already been through a period of devastation, Doseba said.
"They told me that they saw a lot of houses destroyed", he said.
It was a sad story.
Although aid groups have been actively engaged in the initial mobilization of disaster relief equipment, some have claimed that skilled foreign aid teams are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the recruitment of foreign capital, development and personnel will begin once a disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It remains a provincial defeat", said Aulia Arriani, the national spokesperson.
When the government says, "O.K. This is a national disaster", we can open up foreign aid, but we don't have a status quo.
The night after the earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, on Friday the friends and families of those who have disappeared still hope that their love will be a tragic tale of a natural disaster.
On Saturday, the boys were pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, paramedics rescued the woman from a two-day siege with her mother's body still from him.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national figure skating coach, had been training for the missing two rounds of the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others were detained in the Roa Roa Hotel, which Mandagi attended as his student.
"As a brother in the sport of boating, I have a spirit of my own", he said.
Gendon recounted that in less than an hour after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel bullying in their pride community, they sent a Whatsapp message to Palu's rivals who were chatting at the desert festival.
His message was sent with only one yellow mark instead of one pair of blue.
"I think that means the message is not being sent", he said.
John stole $26,750 while filling an ATM at Newport on Levee.
Jones stole $26,750 in cash on Friday morning from Brink's employee who was loading cash into an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the police department.
The driver drove to the ATM at the entertainment venue and prepared to send more money.
While he was holding control from another man "run up from behind the Brink's staff" and snatched a bag of money to pass on.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not identify the number involved.
Anyone with information about them should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Young rapper changed his name to Ye
Young rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
The change was announced via Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Starting with the official recognition as Kanye West".
West, a 41-year-old man, was nicknamed Ye in an episode which used his nickname as the name of his eighth album which was released in June.
The change will come before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled due to "emotional reasons", the show's creators said.
As well as being an acronym of his current occupational name, West has previously stated that the word has significant religious meaning to him.
"I remember 'Ye' being the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'", West said earlier this year, referring to his nickname to radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
It goes from Kanye, which means only one thing, just Ye- just a reflection of our horror, our good, our evil, our confusion and everything.
This is a reflection of who I am".
He was one of the first famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced a settlement to use the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West coordinator, JAY-Z, did the same with or without the use of labels and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vowed not to use soldiers against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vows to use no military force against civilians as his country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelol Plaza that "never use the military to crack down on Mexicans".
The military shot down a peaceful protest in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people by the time leftist student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support Mexican youth by providing salary bonuses to those who study and opening up more independent state universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have drawn young people into the criminal underworld.
The U.S. should double its investment in A.I. systems.
As China continues to play a more important role in AI, the US should double its investment in analytics, said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and entrepreneur who works for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The rumor arose after various parts of the US federal government made announcements about AI even though the overall US landscape still lacks the strategy to use AI.
In the same vein, last year China introduced a plan to become the world's number one AI innovator by 2030.
"Increasing AI budgets would be a good start because there are many countries that are following the US as many times as we are, and we are pursuing advances in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the investment could help double the chances of a major AI success happening in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of "AI Superpower: China, Sill Valley and the New World Oder" published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In 1980 at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on the AI operating system that won the top position of the American Othello player and then he became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee acknowledged recent U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be to help identify the future vision.
Lee said: "Analysts in the US often have to work hard to get government funding.
"China does not take academics out of the country but as private individuals", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired high-profile university alumni to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that changing immigration policy could help the U.S. become stronger in AI.
"I think the green card should be offered at the AI level automatically", he said.
China's State Council set out plans for the development of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation funds people in academia in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other state organizations don't fund U.S. scientists, but the quality of the work is lower than in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Center for Artificial Intelligence Cooperation, which means that it will have participants from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of an Alternative Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For NSF, there's now over $100 million a year invested in AI analysis.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that seeks to create a national security committee has no intention of making any further mention of artificial intelligence this month.
Macedonians call for a referendum to change the country's name.
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to rename the country the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has one province named Macedonia, which has insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents its territorial claim and has been lobbied for by NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but the nationalists, on the other hand, say that the change will destroy the identity of the majority of Macedonians.
President Gjorge Ivanove has said he will not vote in the referendum and that he will win the post with a 50 percent threshold for any protests.
The referendum question was: "Can membership of NATO and the EU be achieved with the acceptance of the treaty by Greece?"
Supporters of the renaming including the head of state Zoran Zaev insisted it was a price worth paying to join organizations like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the many countries that would collapse Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to welcome the future of the country, to educate the new generation in Macedonia, so that they can live independently under the shadow of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska 79, in Skopje.
Even if it is not in accordance with the law, the deputies can override them to follow the results of the vote to ensure.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority of the National Assembly.
The state Election Commission said there were no reports of disturbances at 1 p.m.
However, the yield is at just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters turned out.
"I came out of my youth and hometown in Europe", Gjose Tanevski, 62, who has a visa in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko attend a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to pave the way for NATO and European Union membership in Strumica Macedonia on November 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, is preparing a small stage and is standing in front of the dancing crowd.
"We join NATO and the EU, but with our leaders we will open the doors", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we are proud".
If they don't accept our national identity, we can become like other countries like China and Russia and part of the Euro-Asian alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members would bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has a jobless rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that most of the arrivals will be useful because 80 percent of our citizens are the desired of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after exercising the right to move.
He said the secret to "agreeing" would be "what will confirm our future".
A poll conducted on Monday by the Macedonian Research Institute said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the protests below.
Another poll by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents would go to church on Sunday.
Over 70 percent would agree.
For a successful referendum, one must have 50 percent of the vote.
The failure of the protests would be a reflection of the policy of the Western governments since it was implemented in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City, Brighton's defender at the door.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence to knock out Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made an easy bet to score his own goal in the 65th minute.
The Alexandrian commander received the ball from the central army during the first period of the order.
He ran a race with Brighton's three-man back before being put on the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by people in green suits.
He fought one of the rearguards before doing several more at the gates of Brighton.
Then he fought and threw the ball to Sterling's left.
England kicked a goal in the gate to return the ball to right-footed Aguero, defeating the goalkeeper via Mathew Ryan with a shot into Nate's right.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his play in the 55th, 60th minute.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he could do the door at that time".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues a match in the Premier League.
That door was in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored from Brighton's basket.
He delivers a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few minutes before sending Sterling.
The Sky Blues' front-runner scored from the net before the line.
The match will be played at Hoffenheim in the Champions League round at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play hockey against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's not much reason to force a fresh start.
But Scherzer who likes the game hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but if still affected by the Rockies' championship run the Los Angeles Dodgers lead one game in the NL West.
The Rockies clinched at least an unexpected berth by defeating the Nationals on Saturday night by a score of 5-2, but still clinched a spot on their first-round line.
Even if we play a no-win, at least we can face the problem of Denver with crowds and other teams playing at the top of every point I'll meet this year.
Why can't I compete?
The Nationals have yet to open on Sunday, but there are likely reports that Scherzer will be in that position.
Scherzer, who will start the game for the 34th time, played in the regular season on Thursday and will take a regular break on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and has struck out 300 in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump has had protests in West Virginia.
The president referred to the situation at his Supreme Court circuit that elected Brett Kavanaugh as he discussed the importance of Republican rallies in the midst of the election.
Everything we do is a risk in November.
Five weeks until one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a big, big thing, I didn't run but I actually did run, which is why I'm fighting for good applicants", he said.
Trump continued: "You see the very dreaded Democratic extremists, you see it happening right now.
And they're determined to restore power by using the means of corruption if necessary, you'll see the corruption, the corruption.
They don't care who they're ruining, who they're building to get power and control, what they want is power and control, and we're not going to let them go.
He said the Democratic Party had the duty to "resist and obstruct".
And you see that over the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "cruel and mean and cowardly and cowardly".
He referred to the Senate Rules Committee by naming Democratic congresswoman Dianne Feinstein, which received a scathing response from the audience.
Do you remember his answer?
Do you leave the file in the trash?
What is it?
No, no, I was expecting something that was the most beautiful language, the ugliest language I've ever seen.
Labor is no longer a broad church.
It's unbearable for people to say what's in their heart.
When Momentum activists in my local party are tempted to hate me, it's hardly a surprise.
In the end, I was the slowest of the Labour MPs to realize we were not welcome, because we all speak our minds.
My council colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a strong stand against the anti-Semitic state.
In my case, the anti-titanism criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy to national security, to Europe, is a phenomenon similar to what Jeremy strangely disagrees with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want that meeting to be well-managed and efficient".
For the last eight years as a local Labour Party member, the GC meeting on Friday night has been exactly that.
Sadly today it is not the voice of many meetings and the promise of politics that "more soft and healthier" has long been forgotten if it ever really started.
It is increasingly clear that different perspectives are not accepted in the Labour Party and that all views will be judged as acceptable to the party leadership.
This was after Jeremy became a leader, and soon as a colleague who I thought shared the same political views started expecting me to turn around and take positions that I disagreed with, whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, and it doesn't matter what I say, there's a backlash on social media calling for elections, calling for a centrist politics, telling me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
Of course, I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues because the opinions about me are usually political.
I respect the professionalism and commitment of those colleagues who deal with the daily flow of sexist and racial slurs, but never shame.
One of the most disappointing aspects of politics in this era is the level of power becoming the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is we're not a broad church and all the "no confidence" arguments or changes to the electoral rules are even more narrow.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years that made me kneel down and then I'd get better myself.
But that's not what you want to do when you're playing politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, challenged by the Thatcher government's indifference to throwing my vast school classrooms into the ground, I have sought better public services for those who really need them, whether as a local ambassador or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East discussed in any way my policy stance and the extent of my disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who advocate for justice on Monday, I can say that when the country is relying on Brexit to destroy our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But one message I have is not really for Nottingham Momentum, it's for my representatives whether they're Labour or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no amount of voter intimidation or political intimidation will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: No one can stop Ayr from taking the lead
A second attempt may have derailed the final result but there is no doubt that Ayr will win Tennent's Premiership in the match against India today.
They are currently at the top of the table as the only undefeated side out of ten.
In the end, it was the defense that outnumbered their chances which drove home the field and Coach Murchie had every right to be pleased.
"We've done our game testing so far and we haven't lost anyone so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Credit Ayr, they're using their chances better than I did".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, sent by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in front, but the yellow card for Rory Hughes as Scotland's goalkeeper took him out of the game that Warrior was leading, allowing Melrose to tell with the numbers and Jason Baggot to take the attempt to not pass.
Climo overcame Ayr with a penalty earlier in the half, he scored from a single substitute to make it 17-5 with Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort, sent Baggot down to five shots.
Then came a severe injury-plagued stoppage to Ruaridh Lnott, who was dismissed but returned, Ayr also pushing forward through Stafford McDowall's resistance, replaced by Climo.
Ayr retained the seat with Tony Blair Macpherson receiving the yellow card again, Melrose paid extra money to Bruce Colvine who still had not repented at the end of the intense pressure.
The home side returned, and when Struan Hutchinson got the yellow card from the deal with Climo without the ball, from MacPherson's penalty spot to Ayr's backside the maul approached.
Climo sent, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe grabbed the penalty-point ball from David Armstrong and sent Gregor Henry out on the sidelines for a fifth-stroke.
The star game is still geared towards a new career in the restaurant industry.
Gaming superstar Ford Kieran appears to be moving into the service industry after finding out he's been nominated for the position of director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor landed the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, which he wrote and co-starred in with his long-time teammate Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the final chapter in the show's life and it was apparent that Kiernan was planning for life after Craiglang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although the Scottish Sun said Kiernan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperity restaurant trade".

Throughout Bolivia's landlocked country, memories of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century resource dispute remain as vivid as the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
Those expectations may be the highest in decades as Bolivia awaits a court hearing on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has a spirit of solidarity and peace and expects the outcome with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, the Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the World Court hearings on big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will agree with Bolivia's demand that after decades of negotiations, the country must negotiate for Bolivia's independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the moderate indigenous president of Bolivia who faces a contentious fight for a new election next year, also had a grand jury trial on Monday.
"We are close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia and that little will change if it does".
The United Nations in the Netherlands has no authority to award Chilean territory and has stated that no definite outcome is possible.
The trial of the World Court took place just six months after the last hearing of the argument, which indicated that the case was not resolved, said Paz Zárate, the Chilean international legal expert.
And far from the cause of Bolivia, far more than four years ago, it could have caused another problem.
"The problem of access to the sea is being solved by the Bolivian government now", Zárate said.
He suggested that Morales's rhetoric had attracted the attention of the rest of Chile.
Sometimes Bolivia and Chile will still have a point to talk about, but it will be very difficult to talk about it afterwards.
The two countries have not had diplomatic exchanges since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was faster than usual.
Monday will bring "a special opportunity to open a new sacred relationship with Chile" to Bolivia and an opportunity to "end 139 years of conflict over common interests", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, is using navigation skills as a political lever.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The trial is an opportunity to show that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear weapons will not happen unless the United States can be trusted.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his country would not disarm its nuclear weapons unless Washington could be trusted.
Ri spoke on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to honor the commitments made during the Singapore Leaders' Summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments were about the United States. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to start negotiations on a halted nuclear test more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong Un left Singapore.
Ri said the remaining "dream pipeline" and US opposition to the Korean War ceasefire would cause North Korea to surrender.
Washington is careful to agree to a declaration without Pyongyang before making a major arms move.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about lifting the blockade, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump Leadership Summit.
The Paris fashion show show showcases the latest in big clothes on the High Street near you.
If you want to increase the size of your collection or completely block out the sun, then don't point further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a bizarre large-scale collection for their SS19 collection on the streets, giving Paris Fashion Week a smiling moment.
The very tall unused caps were removed from Instagram this summer and these designers posted the stunning things they designed down in the fashion parade.
A prominent design by Valentino is an egg-colored hat decorated with broad feathers like bird feathers that protrude from her head.
Other large accessories include diamond-tipped bamboo, pear-shaped pearls, and even pear-shaped pearls, but they are not designed to keep your head moist.
Thom Browne also unveiled a bizarre and Halloween-themed mask.
The multi-colored mask has a narrow mouth and looks more like Hannibal Lecter than high-end cutting art.
One of the innovations is a watercraft with a water-towel and glasses, while the other is a molten-column.
And if you're still in the announcement of the big fashion show, you're in luck.
Observers predict that large cats can be seen walking up the high street near you.
The big hat started to become popular following 'La Bomba', a two-foot-wide-winged butterfly that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski saw.
The car of the goat on the back of the unused high-heeled goat that was published through social media led to other big innovations in fashion such as sandbags that were as big as the sample of the covered swimsuit.
The burnt pink palm pouch decorated with a palm tree and containing a white paper handle was a highlight in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The contemporary artist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I'm looking forward to seeing the big sandbags and the high-end cars for next summer because the designers have created such a huge impact that it can be difficult to ignore the need for large-scale jewelry.
John Edward: A key message for citizens around the world.
Scotland's private schools maintain a record of academic excellence and this continues in 2018 along with a host of other outstanding achievements that are only reinforced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With an increase of 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Council of Scottish Private Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As a department of education that can design and implement specific school curricula, we see that new languages continue to be a popular and sought-after choice within schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to people in a language they understand, it goes into their heads.
If you speak to them in their own language, it goes to their heart.
This is a powerful stimulant that we cannot use in English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year's semester, we can see that languages rank high in the ranking with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68 percent of all students studying foreign languages have A-levels.
Data collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students achieved an A-plus in Central Chinese, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Today, languages as an elective subject are being placed in the same category as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in private school curricula and others.
A survey by the UK Employment and Skills Foundation in 2014 found that of the reasons employers gave for the difficulty of recruiting candidates for job vacancies, 17 per cent were due to lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
With job opportunities requiring more languages, these skills are essential in the digital age.
Regardless of what career a person chooses, if they learn a second language, they're going to be equipped with these skills for the rest of their lives.
The ability to communicate effectively with people from abroad will automatically enable people to speak in multiple languages before the competition.
From a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 British adults, 75% were not fluent enough in a foreign language to create a conversation, and French was the only language with two digits, 15%.
This is why funding language teaching is so important for children today.
Multilingualism, especially in developing countries, gives children better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will have a different language.
Many schools will focus on more complex modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Central Chinese or Japanese.
Whether you are interested in your child will have a variety of languages to choose from in private schools with a teacher who is an expert in this area.
Scottish Private Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and their guests with the skills needed no matter what the future may hold.
It is undeniable that at this time, in the global business environment, language remains extremely important to the future of the country, so this will have to be reflected in education.
Of course, a new language should be considered a "technology of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
Jonh Edward is the Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council.
LeBron is opening for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's pre-season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But when it was said that he would play for a minute, it was not decided yet.
Walton said on the Lakers' official website that it's going to be more than one and less than 48.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell warned that James may be out for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need to have a pre-season game during this period to be fully prepared", he said.
Fishing time at the Virginia River, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicked off his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It was the first of five planned speeches over the coming week, including a ceasefire in places with various supporters, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a stalemated vote for his choice to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is building support for the upcoming midterm elections, in which the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is down in November.
What time is the Virginia River Fishing Night, and how can you watch it online?
The Wheeling, West Virginia City of Light is scheduled for 7 PM ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Virginia River Fishing Online live on YouTube below.
The river may be referring to this week's trial of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained by sexual misconduct charges with a Senate confirmation vote expected to be suspended for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of the campaign's complexity is to help the Republicans face the November election with some extra support.
Thus, Trump's campaign says that the five speeches in the coming weeks will focus on "active Republican candidates and supporters trying to protect and expand their large group of supporters in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Controlling the lower house is very important for your presidency to travel to as many states as possible as we enter a complex campaign season", Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's parade could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw press coverage from Pittsburgh", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that the storm has hit Virginia, a state that won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
The river is trying to help fellow Republican senator candidate Patrick Morris, who is in the poll.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to try to trigger a poll", said Simon Haeder, a city scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows the momentum to fight for the chance to enter the Sunday singles
After three singles, Saturday afternoon's four-man foursomes may be just what this Ryder Cup needs.
The broadest sense of kinetic energy is a completely invented sporting concept but one that the players really believe in and nothing more than races like these.
So they would say where is the power of movement now?
"They had six points and now they have four, so I guess we're running out of energy", said Jordan Spieth as he walked out for the day.
The European side tied, of course, with four points to go with 12 more in play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel they have a little boat wind and a lot of energy, at least from Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each drew three out of four.
Spieth throws the ball from the point of the frame to the wind and is led by example.
The sound of those cheers echoed as his lap continued, a key blow to win the game on all fours when he and Thomas both went down two laps later.
His knockout victory in the 15-game series was a similar vote, which tells you that he believes the U.S. team is not out of the game.
"You get into real depth and worry about your own competition", Spieth says.
It's all these players that are now gone.
18 Holes for building a score.
The players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange European blood, but the happy couple is four out of four and can't make a mistake.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoons, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and returned on Friday morning.
That continuation and how their energy will flow to and from the excited crowd that they are the players to win on Sunday and there will be no more keen players to repeat the European victory in the West through Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Well, they're both in different caves at the same time.
Talking about the beauty of Europe is not yet pleasant.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson hosted Sergio Garcia, the Four Sons of the Morning, when he teamed with Alex Noren.
One bowler and two doubles in the front nine or nine holes first drilled the Spaniard and the Swede into the corner they never got close to dancing out.
Even on Sunday, no one helped you out of your hole.
Four and four are fascinating to look closely at because of the interaction between the partners, the advice they give, the advice they don't, and how strategy can change the present.
Europe played better than before and were the key leaders towards the end, but this four-man series also shows that the United States team is showing a willingness to fight again, especially since the Stateside is still in doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 to the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a better chance of entering the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming up from Saturday's four-man and four-man series by a score of 10-6.
Tommy Fleetwood's partner Francesco Molinari, who had been inspired to lead the race with two victories over Tiger Woods, tried to climb the table last week at Le Golf National in a four-way tie.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, fighting to retain their losing position at Hazeltine two years earlier, led the American side that had been beaten in the early morning quarter, drawing 3-1.
The United States had increased opposition by four, winning two, but they could not make up for what was missing.
Jim Furyk's side needed a replacement from Saturday's 12 ice-league to keep it going.
Fleetwood was the first European to win four consecutive draws while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after the sensation weekend, were only the second pair to win four since their opening four in the Ryder Cup era.
With Woods and Patrick Reed in the top four, they were able to match Woods and new American Bryson Dechambeau by adding 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself through two shots on Saturday, showed his final blasts coming off the bench but now he's lost 19 of his 29 shots at fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was left for four in the morning, returned to pair with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to take a 2&1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - at number one and three in the world.
Europe did not have it on its own, though it had a happy day, hunting lions southwest of Paris.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas anchored the U.S. with two goals on Saturday.
They defeated 2&1 North Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourballs back to catch Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the four losses in the two-hole opening.
There have only been two times in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has come back from a four-match deficit to advance to the knockout stage, although Furyk's supporters have always wanted to keep the lead.
After the second best came two days later, however, the Sunday night debate seemed to be outrunning them.
North Korea says 'no way' to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued aggression only heightened mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would disarm its own nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN annual general assembly that North Korea had adopted "measures of great goodwill" in the past year, such as halting nuclear testing and nuclear weapons, acquiring nuclear test sites and pledging to not proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not seen any consistent response from the United States", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can disarm ourselves first".
While Ri spoke of North Korea's shared opposition to Washington's "temporary" approach to nuclear weapons under which North Korea would be rewarded as it proceeds, his statement highlighted the importance of not getting rid of unilateral nuclear weapons as has been done in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to move towards "the denuclearization of Korea" while Trump pledged North Korea's security.
North Korea formally requested a 1950-53 Korean War ceasefire, but the United States said it only needed to disarm its own nuclear weapons first.
Washington also opposed calls for the lifting of the international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is committed to 'nuclear defense first' and has intensified pressure by force to achieve its objectives in the form of bombing and even resisting 'end-of-war declarations,'" Ri said.
"The idea that oppression can make us our own is the impossible dream of people who don't care about us.
But the problem is that continuing to push is only deepening our insecurities".
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the US leader had highlighted at the UN earlier in the week.
The minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and the North Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the party to the nuclear arms issue is South Korea and not the United States, the North Korean nuclear arms industry will not be in the same situation".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was markedly different from last year, when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly targeting the mainland United States with the inevitable North Korean bombing after what Kim called "the president of evil" Kim "will explore" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who has threatened to "destroy North Korea for the sake of the war", complimented Kim for his courage to proceed with disarmament, but argued that much more needs to be done and that the force must be there until North Korea has a nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it takes two years, three years or five months".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward the central bank for its actions.
However, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The Security Council's deterrence must continue vigorously and without fail until we believe that nuclear weapons have been tested, finally, all together".
The Security Council has been actively supporting pressure on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to accelerate funding for its nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was rarely successful.
He left Beijing in July, saying that progress had been made, only for North Korea within hours of his nomination for creating "the needle-like chief".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to purchase its nuclear weapons and development facilities if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that the "compatible measure" he was asking for was the assurance of the treaty that was signed in Singapore and moving towards restoring relations with Washington.
A Harvard graduate student studies moderate exercise
One new course at Harvard University this year is giving college graduate students enough sleep to fight the male culture of studying through 'all-night reading' with caffeine.
One study found that students at one of the world's top universities often go crazy when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the study after giving a talk about the effect of taking time off from studying.
'At the end of it a girl came to me and said: 'Why am I only being told this at this time, my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me a lot,' he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students how the need for good sleep helps improve academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health services division, said the university decided to recommend the course after finding students sleepy during the weekdays.
The course is several hours long, including a series of questions.
In one section is a picture of the dormitory hall, where the students press coffee cups, cloths, coaches and books to tell about the effects of caffeine and lighting and the athletic results were affected by insufficient sleep and the importance of a daily routine.
In another section, participants were told how sleeping could increase the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, depression, and cancer.
The interactive school district map helps the delegates to reflect on their daily activities.
'We know that it will not change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know, as you do, the health effects of the choice to smoke,' Professor Czeisler added.
He says that the culture of 'all-night book reading' persisted, with the addition of more modern technology and the increased pressure on students, which meant that sleeping was a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough quality sleep will be the students' 'secret weapon' to fight anger, fatigue and anger, he says, but even to avoid weight gain from sleeping brings the brain into the diet, keeping them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying biochemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design a course when he joined one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to pursue courses throughout the university district.
He hopes the next step will be to tell PhD students and those attending similar training programs to complete the same before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to think about setting a timer or alarm clock, as well as when to wake up and be aware of the devastating effects of 'blue light' from electronic screens and LEDs, which can take your self-awareness out of the fray, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal against Gerrard's men's team
Rangers suffered a shoulder injury in the Blue Day game when Dolly Menga's shot caused Steven Gerrard's side to lose 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to stabilise on their first win since February's 4-1 win at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard's second 18-inning defeat to the hosts to send Hearts to the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga tied seven minutes into halftime and the Rangers' women's team in the promotion didn't always have the potential.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth, Livingston climbed to third and just behind Hibernian just missed out.
And there could be problems in the store for the Rangers after the Calum Spence had to undergo head surgery after a clear shift of material from another location.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances, which saw Ayr reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 that drew one from Hearts last week and he would be pleased with how well his set turned out pushing his left-sided opponent in every return.
The Rangers may have more balls, but Livingston has more balls than they do.
They should have been out just two minutes when Menga's first kick sent Scott Pittman through Allan McGregor's door, but his big midfield opportunity opened up.
Keaghan Jacobs' son Frederick was then seriously injured by Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow was able to replace him in the back.
The Rangers took control but looked more optimistic than confident about their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos felt sure he should have a penalty in the fifteenth minute because he and Steven Lawless clashed, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian players' protest.
Rangers scored twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was only defended by Lassana Coulibaly's head and a lightweight Ovie Ejaria's shot.
While Livi's 34th opener may have been against the continuation of the play, no one can deny that they deserved it for their single donation.
Again the Rangers failed to protect Jacobs's pawn.
Scott Arfield was unimpressed when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who was still upset about choosing Manga.
Gerrard retired during the break when he replaced Ryan Kent and the switch almost immediately resulted when the wingman drilled a hole in Morelos but Kelly honed his line to block.
But Livingston continued to lure the audience into playing the game they truly loved, with Lithgow and Halkett constantly checking the ball.
Holt's side could pull them out in the final but McGregor was determined to turn Jacobs down before Lithgow took the lead out of the corner.
Rangers changed Glenn Middleton to a penalty when he got into trouble over Jacobs, but again Thomson was not interested.
The Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago and counting... the day the late physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The Geiger developed a method for observing and measuring the spectrum, eventually leading to the device known as the Geiger Counter.
Since the Geiger Counter became a popular cultural reference, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", it is unlikely that these stars were the famous scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that on earth?"
Rogers: "A Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the echoes of the atoms emitted by the scattering of radiation in the mineral".
Evans: "Of course it is climbing!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But his name survived.
New cancer vaccine may teach you to 'see' the Devil
A new cancer vaccine can teach you to fly against the devil's 'sight' and kill them
Vaccines teaches to kill antibodies recognized as part of the treatment
How to deal with the antibody mix from the patient, changing them in the room
They can then 'see' the protein throughout the cancer and then be absorbed again.
Experimental vaccines are showing promising results in many cancer patients.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine, which teaches the anti-cancer virus to fly, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The way they interact with the antibodies from the patients, changing them in the cells, they can 'see' a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-enter.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", says Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "drives the spread of many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and liver cancers, explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar procedure of removing antibodies from patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells is done in the treatment of a blood cancer.
Kanye West began to speak about his love for the oil, wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday night airing after a lavish performance in which he cheered U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would retire in 2020.
After his third performance that evening, Ghost Town, in which he wore a giant American-made hat, he spoke out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for the river.
"So many times I've met white people and they say, "How can you beat him, he's a racist and racialist?"
"Oh, if I was worried about racial and ethnic identity, I would have moved out of the U.S. a long time ago", he says.
SNL began the show with the death of Matt Damon, who was portrayed by Hollywood actor Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judicial Committee over allegations of sexual abuse made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not released theatrically, West's emotional footage was uploaded to online media by actor Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether Rock is trying to blame West by posting.
In addition, West told the audience that he had been spending time in the wedding room about the device on his head.
"They bullied me in the wedding room.
"You must not leave without your cloak", they said.
They Persecuted Me!
And then they say I'm in the bathroom", he said, according to the Washington Interpreter.
West continued, "Do you want to see where the water sinks?" He said, "I'm going to put on my jeans, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
"I have learned to love my wife and my children.
His comments made the audience giggle at least twice and the cast members of SNL were furious, with one person there expressing dismay, Variety reports: "The whole studio feels quiet".
West was brought in to replace Ariana Grande, whose longtime girlfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West has made many people silent with his I Love It, his marriage to Perrier Bottle.
West was endorsed by TPUSA Atomic Group chief Candace Turner, who urged: "To one of the bravest minds: Thank you for standing up for the flag".
But TV host Karen Hunter said that West "has been who he is and that's the most critical".
"But I choose not to reward some people (by buying his music or makeup or sponsoring his "art") who I believe are receiving and encouraging the kind of exposure that is detrimental to my community.
He has moral rights.
"We are the same", she adds.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now "Kanye West as officially known".
He was not the first artist to change their name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper, Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course the former music police officer changed his name to a nickname, and the artist was known as the Lion.
The attempted murder at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
He is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the state prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington is a spider out of toxic manhood
Kit Harington is famous for his swordsmanship role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor released a classic version of the man, saying that the on-screen role meant that youngsters often felt like they had to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed 'something' was wrong' and asked how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who is married to his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, recently admitted that he feels 'burdened' about talking about problems.
'I feel a heavy burden on my personal name as we, where are we wrong with manhood?' he says.
'What did we teach the men as they grew up about the problems we see today?'
Kit believes that sexuality may be responsible for the rise of male toxicity thanks to its masculine characteristics.
He continued: 'Which is natural and which is instructed?
What lessons on TV and on the street make young boys feel that they must be a certain side of this masculinity?
I think that's one of the really big questions of our time, how are we going to change that?
Because it is obvious that something is wrong with the young man.'
In interviews he also admitted that he would not do anything that was a prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the book ended the following summer, saying that he was 'done with the battlefield and the horse'.
From November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepard's True West, which follows the story of the creator and his brother, who is a stockbroker.
The actor recently revealed that he is considering meeting his wife Rose to make the best of what's to come from Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife at this show, so in that way it gives me an eternal family and my life away from here,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy film.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie family home in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of its own citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say more than 820,000 people have been affected.
It was reported that 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Almost all of the new order is communicated through sex, making changes from the old.
But in the past, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusing infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped by almost half, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Yerevan capital.
However, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's ancient values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry the woman.
Many infections from contraception are not confined to these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged global access to HIV treatments as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the GOP senator's informants were corrupt, blasting 'a perpetual lie' and 'a philosophy of consensus'
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denied allegations on Saturday that one of her employees posted the personal information of a U.S. Republican senator to the party's Wikipedia page.
Los Angeles Democrats insisted that the claims were being echoed by experts and the website of the "special right wing".
"Lies, lies and disgraceful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information was obtained from the home and phone records of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of the Carolinas and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information came online Thursday posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address at the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and leaked the information of Waters' staff member, Hill.
"This baseless allegation is all lies and obviously false", Waters continued.
"My employees whose personal data, personal data and security were compromised due to false and untrue allegations will not be held accountable for this leak.
This unfounded accusation is all lies and lies".
Waters's statement prompted online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is appalling", Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests that she is not fit to be a member of Congress.
When accused of something they did not do, some people get angry.
They should not be provocative.
They are not allowed to question their accusers.
They need to be quiet and quiet".
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's behavior to that of Democratic Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too violent during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is running to keep Waters out of the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate units and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed", she continued, "and thus they will be held legally accountable for their destructive and destructive actions against any and all of my employees".
The film is based on the book of the same name by Johnnie English Strikes Again.
It's a modern trend to find the significance of Brexit in a new leaf with a British slant and that doesn't apply to this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was quickly brought back to life in 2011 with the rebirth of Johnny English.
Is the self-deprecating smell in the glass in the title of our article clearly an opportunity to deliver a new message?
In a sense, the blind Johnny English had his license to paint things renewed for the second time - that name of the message more than anything else he had created was a broad-based contract for the non-English speaking area.
He is of course a representative of the Ba'ath who, despite his amazing water-pumping skills, has a tiny Clouseau, the liveliness of Mr Bean and the dollop that formed the chord of the theme Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics.
He was originally based on the traveller and mystery alien Atkinson when he played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial, causing a stir in his wake.
There were one or two of the best highlights of the last JE trip.
I like Johnny English getting into a helicopter while getting married in the middle of a series of hijackings and the helicopter leaves briefly hitting his hat.
Atkinson's gift for authenticity was in the show, but authenticity is felt all the time and intensely, especially since "real" brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently provide authenticity as an ingredient.
The marketplace feels more like a child's than an adult's place, and for me the phenomenon of Johnny English's magic is not as creative and focused as Atkinson's paper-like lipstick on Bean's body.
The special situation for many years now is that the United Kingdom has been in serious trouble.
Cyber enthusiasts have hacked into the UK's top intelligence network, exposing the identities of UK units in the field, to make the unit perform a crucial mission - a minor mishap for Kevin Eldon.
It's the final nail in the coffin for a prime minister who is a handsome, fighting figure, experiencing the demise of all political disapproval: Emma Thompson does her best with these four Teresa-May models, but there's not much in the chapter to work with.
Her secretary tells her that since the constantly emerging secrets have been destroyed, she will have to take some out of the order.
And that means, to be fair, Johnny English himself, now working as a school principal in some of the larger establishments, but giving out record lessons on how to be a secretary: some good finger-picking here, because English offers a secretary course at the School of Rock.
English was rushed to Whitehall for a happy-go-lucky explanation and reunited with long-time former bandmate Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough, now a married man, had a brush with the Blackwater pirates, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine died young.
So Batman and Robin get their big break in Her Majesty's Secret Service back in action, with a meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is in constant danger under the cloak of a tech giant who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough began their high-profile escape: posing as shoemakers, they set fire to a French restaurant, they set up a hijacking of them aboard Volta's rescue ship, and English created a sensation as he tried to use reality headphones to get him to get acquainted with Volta's home.
All the stops were certainly pushed out for that last sequence, but because of the friendly and exciting as it was, the background had a little kid's TV on it all.
The Bible is full of truths that are not lost on us.
And like other Johnny English books I couldn't help thinking: Couldn't the British book industry give Rowan Atkinson a lesson that could really do justice to his blessing?
Labour denies it is planning to give Britons a four-day workweek but pay five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a basic plan to see Britons work four days - but get paid five.
According to the report, the party demanded that the company's chief executive make a proposal to the workers through artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them a special holiday.
He sees a hired hand with three days off, but still earning the same amount of money as his family.
The sources say the idea will 'fit' with the economic crisis and the party's plan to divide the country for the benefit of workers.
The change to a four-day workweek was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to adjust to the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'The review of the policy is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but a four-day work week is a desire consistent with the Party's policy of rebalancing the economy in the interests of workers as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to adopt such a concept, with the Green Party pledging a four-day workweek during its own 2017 general election campaign.
However, the will is not now fully supported by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not party policy and it is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow chairman John McDonnell used last week's Labour meeting to elaborate on his approach to corporate reform in the economy.
McDonnell said he was set to take back power from the 'unknown executive' and 'over-profits' at the utility company.
The shadow plan also means that current shareholders in the water company may not get their entire shares back because the Labour government can 'hijack' on the basis of a recognised wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to add staff to the Board of Trustees and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds to give 10 percent of the assets of the private sector to the tenant, who stands to take an annual contribution of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" that the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case will not change their minds
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised questions as to whether the interviewer's findings could persuade any members of the Senate to withdraw their support.
In an interview with Sunday's Sunday afternoon edition of the newspaper, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would convince them.
The law that Kennedy opened more than his colleagues from the Carolinas.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I'm going to the trial, I said, I've already met with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the accusation came out, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, determined, and unquestioning".
However, Graham's vote showed that the penny was hard.
"My heart is with Brett Kavanaugh and it's going to make an explosive accusation", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright", Graham added, quoting Christine Blasey Ford.
"and everyone she named couldn't test it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see anything new".
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to alleviate poverty?
New York this weekend will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual dance event featuring a diverse group of talented performers and an equally inspiring mission: end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy performances such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to remind the public of the goal of ending the Great Depression by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actually fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), pilgrims must complete a series of tasks or "operations" such as volunteering, emailing world leaders, telephoning, or other meaningful means to help build a mindset in their goal of ending poverty.
But how did Global Citizen manage to achieve its goals in 12 years?
Is the idea of giving people free shirts a genuine way to encourage people to call for action or another technique called "clicktivism", where people feel they are making a difference by singing online or sending messages?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from supporters, pushing for goals.
It says these actions have helped to spur global leaders to commit more than $37 trillion to policies that are set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group claimed that 390 commitments and disclosures arose from its own operations, with at least $10 billion either paid or funded.
The group estimates that the mutual funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the major pledges include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor and implementer partnership that pledges to "help children grow to their full potential", pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end food shortages in the country after receiving more than 4,700 reviews from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice or industrial inequality a thing of the past", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live show in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 campaigns calling for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced the Power of Nutrition program that will reach 5 million women and children with commercial assistance.
In answer to a frequently asked question on their own website, which asks: "What makes you think we can really end poverty?"
Global citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road, sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that came before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are in the middle of some of the shows at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy for "blocking" to block Russian energy exports - Interior Ministry
"If necessary", Washington could have its own navy to defend Russian forces in various markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke has alleged that Russia's presence in Syria, particularly where it is conducting its official government invitation, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to be the dominant force as they do in Eastern Europe, southern central Europe", he reportedly said.
And according to the officials, there are many ways and many ways to handle it.
"With our navy, the United States has the ability to make sure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary to close, to make sure that their forces don't go to the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, seeing that they were equally competent.
"More or less, the economic choice for Iran and Russia is to go ahead and replace oil", he said, while referring to Russia as "a self-deceiving horse" with an oil-dependent economy.
The statement came as the oil company was in the process of supporting its own natural gas exports to Europe, rather than Russia, as a more affordable option for European consumers.
To that effect, oil officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to the oil, made Berlin the "kingdom" of Moscow".
Moscow stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which was set up to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was driven by simple economic reasons and exemplified unfair competition.
"I believe we are changing the philosophy that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and so consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States position anticipated a negative outcome from Germany, which reaffirmed its own commitment to the project.
The leading body for German industry, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere with European energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of Energy Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a hard look at the 2020 presidential election, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "hard look" at the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider applying.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that's with women in the top positions", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider the presidential inauguration".
Warren praised President Donald Trump in the middle at City Hall, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to my bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a video on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we want an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, opinion polls released on Thursday showed that a large majority of her electorate did not think she should retire in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters "may" say a senator should not be running, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such an execution.
The poll showed increased support for resignation by Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour of resignation and 48 percent against resignation.
Other notable Democrats who have studied the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in March, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cited PTSD from Track Palin at the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged in domestic violence Monday night
"What my son is going through, what he is going through is coming back, I can relate to other families who are aware of the effects of PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers are returning to", she told the audience at a watershed in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his detention "sitting in the room" and told of his son and other war veterans, "They came back a little different, they came back feeling, they came back wondering if there was that respect for what it was that their friends and their pilots and all the other soldiers had given up".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against women, interfering with domestic violence reports and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. Supporting the Challenge of New Asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are strongly supporting a legal challenge to the new U.S. law that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a court-friendly brief Friday in Washington to support asylum seekers in their challenge to the death penalty, NBC News reported.
The full name of Joe in Grace v. The class action lawsuit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal government was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his gang member son" raped her, but U.S. authorities denied her asylum offer in July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state attorneys who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which resulted in large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as those countries faced common problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy violates the 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals agreement, which allows immigrants without a violent background to apply for asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "does not violate decades of state, federal and federal laws".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and specific circumstances of the application and the bar violates that principle", the court's brief read.
The prosecutor further argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants was detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying they could become agents and "provide essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide shelter for victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is available to those who have fled their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", the conference said in its June 11 press release.
Refuge does not mean the elimination of all the problems that people face every day around the world, but it does mean all the terrible problems.
Aid efforts in Palu give hope as the total number of deaths doubles in the search for survivors
For survivors, the situation is more violent.
"It's very emotional", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who is giving warmth to her young son who is sick in a refugee center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute a hospital bus brings in a body.
"I was so happy to be able to do this", she says.
I've seen residents return to their damaged homes, pick through the cracks, try to borrow everything they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and some were hospitalized as a result of the damage caused by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who was shot in the back and neck, were staying outside the Paris military hospital, where patients were being treated outside as the quake continued to be strong.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt when a powerful earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save us.
I was pushed into the dustbin of the wall, I thought", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife's cry for help, but then I went quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they survive".
US press accuses China of 'scrambling' with 'transport advertising'
A week after a Chinese newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in a U.S. daily newspaper urging the mutual benefit of China-U.S. trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using American media to publish the propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited the China Daily's paid-up share of the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the US congressional elections on November 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is trying to interfere in the US election mark a new step in Washington's campaign to increase pressure on China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to campaign to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them at the level of tariff barriers on each other's imports.
China's response at the start of the trade war was designed to counter the exporting countries in several states, such as the Republican-backed state of Iowa, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register Sunday, "China is now doubling down on the frying by putting a shipping ad in our own Free News".
"In publishing its own traffic, the Chinese government is seeking its own benefit from the street culture of American talk and fashion news by placing advertisements purchased in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the street newspaper here in Beijing, you will find limited opposition and not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese may have about China's troubled economic cycle, with the media under the heavy control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has refused to offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which one.
Republican Party members make a difference to women voters ahead of midterm elections and Kavanaugh's outrage, analysts warn
With many prominent Republicans still waiting and defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts warned they would see consequences, especially for women during the upcoming midterm elections.
The atmosphere is very high and most Republican members are on record indicating that they want to go ahead with the vote.
They are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he suspected the last minute appeal by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to silence angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Saturday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested on the Senate floor as Republicans controlled the Judiciary Committee's decision to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the intervention of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and drive for democracy is going out of the way", Stu Rothenberg, a central political analyst, told the news website.
"People are saying it's high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among undecided suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, while those who dislike the president tend not to vote".
But even before Ford's administration gave a rundown of her sexual assault allegations to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that consequences might follow if the Republican Party continues to push hard.
"This has become a crisis for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier in the week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether or not Kavanaugh gets off the bench, it's about how the Republicans arranged this and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a Democratic advocacy group, told the media.
However, sometimes Americans are seen to be separated by those who believe in following the Ford and Kavanaugh policies, with a slightly lower level.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents actually believe or might believe Ford's words, while 35 percent say they actually believe or might believe Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh might be lying or lying in his statement, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake crackdown, the FBI is now investigating the allegations brought by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh raped her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleges that the nominee opened his penis to her while they attended a party during their time studying medicine at Yale in the 1980s.
The creators of the World Wide Web plan to start a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology giant, Inrupt, is a spin-off of Berners-Lee's open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that the Internet behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said at the beginning.
"It was a historic event".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, tests, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about a private online store is that it depends on all users who have access to the type of data.
The company calls it "data-based personal empowerment".
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea for Inrupt is for companies to bring the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM-branded security firm, developers who are volunteers, some of whom have contracts to work on the project, and a group of professional hackers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own cloud-based apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team did not mention "Facebook and Google about bringing all the changes into place where their business models are all set up head-on.
"We did not ask their permission".
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission "is to provide a commercial and ecosystem-based platform to help preserve the integrity and quality of the newly built web in Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee turned to the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
But even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium, the creator of the Web and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very hopeful for the next era of the Web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross winner
Only a Church of England knight would win the Victoria Cross during World War I when the knight was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the 29 September 1918 Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest honour of the British Army.
The man was found unconscious by his two grandchildren at a car park in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was the "final contract" that the memorial would be unveiled 100 years from his grandfather's award ceremony.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt Col Vann led his troops across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through many ravines and under heavy fighting from the field and machine guns".
He then ran up the field of battle and with "extreme courage" brought the ideology forward before jumping on the gun in the single dark field and scoring three victories in the liberation.
The German guns killed thousands of prisoners on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his actions were "something I knew I couldn't do but something faithful".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also set up a post-wedding gala, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt very honored to be part of the march" and added that "the courage of the true Christian is being demonstrated by the support that will be received by many".
MMA fans didn't sleep through the night to watch Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine this, you don't stay up all night to watch Bellator 206 parked just to ignore the original service.
The San Jose ad has 13 tickets, including six tickets on the card and is being aired continuously in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6pm, as Father Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, the UK audience was left shocked when the taping was turned into a Peppa Pig cartoon.
Some are surprised after staying up late at night, especially because of the rising of the sun.
One fan on Twitter described the transformation into a children's cartoon as "a kind of water puppet".
"It's government policy at 6 a.m. that content is inappropriate, so they have to turn it into a children's show", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig", yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker says they are working on their timetable to bring the UK audience into the future.
"I think when I think about the backbone, I think we might be able to fix it", Coker said.
"It is the sixth hour of the day of the week, and we cannot solve the problem until the day of the week, because of the time of the week.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there was text back and forth and they were all not friends.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it's not, it's a government issue.
I can promise you that it will not happen again.
We're going to cut it down to five out of six, as we normally do, and we're trying to catch up with the fans, and we're just getting through.
It is a sad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'weak' about his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling less than everyone else because of his sexual orientation, but that gave him the drive to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he entered high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about his right to give "hope" to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less focused on winning the Olympics.
The program's regular host, Kirsty Young, took several months off because of illness.
Appearing as a bored person in Laverne's first show, Daley says he feels "less than" everyone else growing up because "it's not acceptable to society as a boy or a girl".
He says: "To this day, those feelings of less awareness and different feelings have been the reality that has given me the strength and the strength to succeed".
He needed to prove that he was "something", he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic medalist became a well-known LGBT campaigner and used his publicity at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on countries to end the practice of homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt fortunate to be able to live openly without consequences and needed to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said of falling in love with a man - US leather designer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "It caught me by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but he said age was never an issue.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age" - he first went to the Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says it's hard to find someone of the same age who has the same experience of being both tall and short.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says his "entire outlook" changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be about 'I want to win the gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there's something bigger than an Olympic medal.
My Olympic medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not going to be in my shoes,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he quit and it wasn't until he really quit and he died that I finally realized he couldn't win", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I also knew that I had dreamed of my whole life - to dance in front of my hometown crowd at the Olympics, didn't feel better", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection, Proud by Heather Small, which echoed him in creating the Olympics and also made him stand out.

Mickelson Falls was caught sitting in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson will set the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will need to get back to form to avoid it being an unpleasant history.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial show for the 12th straight year, is seated with Jim Furyk for four kids and four Saturdays.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he prefers to be with the United States, the five-time Grand Champion divides his days between being the boss and continuing his game on the sidelines in the hope of resolving his troubles.
Never to have the best integrity of a batsman but at the peak of his career, 48 years is not perfect for the difficult Le Golf National, where long-distance penalties are routinely imposed.
And if the field itself is not a fearsome one, Mickelson, in the ninth minute on Sunday, faces the reigning British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the U.S., four down from the start of the 12th hole, comes out on top, Mickelson's point could prove most important.
Furyk showed confidence in his people, even though he could no longer speak.
"He understood all the steps that he had today, leaned over me one step and put his arms around me and he said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He had a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's been on a lot of these teams in the past and this week.
I may not remember him playing two matches.
I think about it more than that, but that's how it came out and that's how we think we need to go.
He wanted to go out there, like the others".
Mickelson would surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matched the height of his individual statistics.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20 and drew seven, although Furyk said his arrival brought some unwanted things to the team.
"He's a nice guy, he's nice, he's sweet, he likes to make friends and he's the richest guy in the team room", he explained.
"I think the young player has a headache with him, too, this week which will see a headache.
He gave more than he played".
With the European team, Thomas Bjorn knew that many leads could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, with the European team, knows from experience that the many trips to the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily become an uncomfortable one.
The Danes made their first appearance at the 1997 edition of the race at Valderrama, where one side, Seve Ballesteros, were the five-point North American champions, but still only managed to pass the finish line with a margin of victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we led a lot at Valderrama; we led a lot at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only built", Bjorn said, showing off the picture, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and Thursday to take a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You'll have a full day.
Go out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until you're painted on the canvas.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy and that's where the focus is.
I've said all this, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's on the other side, the best players in the world".
Pleased that his players were doing well in the difficult stadium, Bjorn added: "I couldn't go through this alone.
The next day was different.
The next day is the result of the person coming out and that's different things to do.
It's nice to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're there by yourself, you're testing your own abilities as a musician.
That's the message you have to take to the players, make yourself the best tomorrow.
Now you are behind, and he must go and make the best of it".
In contrast to Bjorn, opposite Jim Furyk would find his players to play individually better than they played as a pair, the exception being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who drew three out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those great final results, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up with a loss because Europe had made "the spectacle at Medina".
"I remember every single one of its spells", he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, back in 1999, had assembled his cast in the run-up to the end.
"We have 12 key points the next day, but you want to go down to a quick start like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
When the force is moving in the opposite direction, it creates a lot of pressure in those nuclei.
We put our players in there and we put them out there in the way that we feel like we're going to be, you know, we try to do something amazing the next day".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight back and face Rory McIlroy in the top-flight, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter of the other European sides in the top half of the order.
"I go with this group of players in this lineup because I think it's worth going all the way", Bjorn says in his single selection.
The new German battleship was again delayed
The German Navy's newest warship is due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era battleship, but it won't be there until at least next year due to faulty procedures and costly deployments, local media report.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship, is now postponed until the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper citing the army's spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the date of delivery is unclear.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered back in 2007 will replace the older Bremen-class battleships.
Understand that they will highlight the big guns, anti-aircraft and anti-ship technologies, and some secret technologies like radar, infrared and acoustic downlink.
Another important feature is the longer service life - it should be possible to release the newest warship from the home port for two years.
However, speaking for Germany to the foreign power program, the continued delay means that the modern submarine will be outdated by the time it enters service, Die Zeit said.
The F125 made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into regular service and sent it back to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to the shipbuilders after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media cite a number of "key software and hardware flaws" necessary to render the ship useless if deployed on combat duty.
The lack of software is particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships will be manned by a crew of 120 men - only half the manpower of the older Bremen-class destroyers.
In addition, it appears that the ships are significantly overweight which reduces operational efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to have been twice the weight of the same class of battleship used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price tag of the entire program, including crew training, was another problem.
It said it had raised a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - up from the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problem of the new battleship's excitement became especially important in the context of recent warnings that German naval power was shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged that the navy was in fact "lacking in launching capabilities".
Officials say the problem is constantly accumulating, as old ships are regularly scrapped but no ships are replaced.
He expressed regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could join the navy.
The National Trust records his secret life
New research being conducted in the Scottish Highlands is about to reveal how the geese use the land for their hunting.
It is hoped that the findings will provide new insights into the behaviour of the milking birds and guide future research.
The study by archaeologists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and small pipistrelles (soprano pipistrelles) as well as the salt-and-salt long-eared pipistrels and the Daubenton pipistrels at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the study area to keep track of the activity throughout the year.
NHS officials and volunteers will also carry out mobile scanning with handheld sensors.
All expert voice recordings will be analyzed to find the frequency of your calls and determine what you are doing.
Then they would make a housing map and a report to create a dignified picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, a naturalist at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the species and how each species uses the land.
This information will help determine the effectiveness of habitat management, such as gardening, and the extent to which forest lands are maintained for the deer and other animals involved.
The number of Jews in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that have an impact on their livelihoods and habitat loss.
Wind and light pollution can be a hazard, as can the handling of some food items, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The Bible says that "the eyes of the blind man are unable to see".
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use optical echo-tracking techniques to locate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, pays serious attention to the issue.
It has ten trained specialists, who conduct routine surveys, inspect the islands and occasionally provide rescues.
The organisation also established the Scottish Special and First Trust Fund at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten hereditary hereditary peers.
The area's manager, David Thompson, says the area is a perfect habitat for them.
"At this Threave we have a reservation for you", he said.
"We have old food, lots of big trees, and all good sources of shelter.
But there is much more to learn about them, so our work here and elsewhere will help us to understand more about what they need to grow".
He stressed the importance of finding pre-operative wounds in the field, as it is possible to destroy a small island of unintentional maternal mortality, which could kill up to 400 babies and mothers, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
They are protected and killing, raping or harboring them or destroying their nesting is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a conservation officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the community to come to the rescue.
She says: "We still have so much to learn about our wounds, and for many of us, we still don't know how many are out there".
Ronaldo denies harassment charges because the military is set to sue the German authorities
Cristiano Ronaldo branded the allegations of harassment against him as "fake news", saying people "must promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer filed a complaint with the German news agency Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portuguese and Yugoslav officials have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was accused of paying her $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on Instagram Live, which has 142 million followers less than an hour after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the report as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just trying to get a little bit of a feel for the music.
What they're saying today, fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They will need to preach to themselves in my name.
It is normal.
They want to use my name, but it's a fake.
I'm a happy and all-around good man", the player added, throwing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable suspicious reports in the realm of privacy", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the players would seek compensation for "psychological damage in amounts commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which may be one of the worst human rights violations of the last decade".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a secret room, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly molested her, according to the suit filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo had backed down after the case was filed and told her that he was a "good guy" "99 percent" leaving "one percent".
The court claimed that Ronaldo confirmed that both partners had checks, but that was a confession.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and photographed her injuries in hospital, but later settled out of court because she felt "fear of punishment" and worried about "being bullied in the community".
The 34-year-old said she is now seeking treatment as she continues to suffer from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and this summer moved to Italian giants Juventus on a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'will forever be sad' at the loss of car maker
The UK "will forever be disappointed" if it loses its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said Trade Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the factory would temporarily cease production at its own plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese automaker says the effect of a delayed border in the event of no Brexit deal could eat up time and jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My vision is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March we will still see a shutdown of production at our plants", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's director of operations at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without an agreement on how to handle trafficking, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its own Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concern about what the carmaker says is the risk of supply disruption in the event of no Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line runs on a "real time" basis, with deliveries from suppliers arriving every 37 minutes in both the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border freeze that industry says could lead to slowdowns and shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than the value of the prize pool at its own Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was "suitably adjusted to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We need the best deal that allows, as I say, not just the success of the moment to be enjoyed but for us to seize the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4 today.
"The evidence, not just from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we must all be able to continue to be highly successful in terms of supply chain".
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but in the long run, warned that favorable costs would reduce the factory's competitiveness and ultimately take time and labor.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union organizer at the factory, said his members were increasingly concerned: "In my experience when these jobs are gone, they won't come back.
The government spokesperson said: "We have laid out a realistic and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "extended by a week" as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh battle continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is following the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, Russian-Treaty aid collusion and presidential obstruction of justice.
The decision to remove the deputy attorney general and remain there put Mueller's credibility in jeopardy, prompting a months-long debate in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking on the phone to record the conversation with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
He went to the White House on Monday with reports that he was resigning.
Instead, the meeting with Trump at the then United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "didn't want" the Rosenstein shooting but then delayed the meeting to fuel the clash of Kavanaugh's Republican Congressional committee and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom were witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the case within a week over the anti-Kavanaugh petition, which was delayed by a full congressional vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Tuesday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "No date has been set yet, maybe this week. I think it can be booked for next week to keep things going in the Supreme Court".
But they're going to recognize each other, and I'm always updated".
Some reporters will object by claiming that Sanders has not held a White House interview since September 10.
The artist Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the difficulty of the meeting was not due to the dissatisfaction of the "celebrity" TV anchors, saying: "I agree with the fact that they are celebrity".
He then suggested direct contact with Trump and more media attention.
"The president has done more questioning than the previous president", he added without citing evidence: "We looked at those numbers".
Sanders said the meeting would still take place but that "if the media had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be much better to ask me".
We've been trying a lot to do that, and you've seen us trying hard in the last few weeks, and a brief press release will come when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump often asks questions when he is outside the White House or attending an opening or a speech with a distinguished guest.
Finding the media is rather difficult.
In New York this week, the president may show why the freedom and sometimes the bizarre appearance precede the journalistic integration.
The Health Minister has written to EU officials at NHS Scotland about the dangers of Brexit.
The Health Minister has written to EU staff at NHS Scotland to express their goodwill towards the country and wish them well for staying in the EU after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent the remaining letter less than six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has committed to cover the visa application costs of EU citizens employed in its public service.
In her letter, Freeman said: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal remained ongoing, with a decision expected this spring.
But the UK government is prepared for the possibility of no deal.
I know this is a time of uncertainty for all of you.
So I want to reassure everyone that the participation of all members is valuable regardless of their nationality.
Partners from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and strong skills and drive forward in healthcare services that benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is like your home, and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
In Tennessee, Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie received emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, news reports by Mike Organ of the Tennessean press.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
He came over to the side of the field and fell down, Reed said.
The coach and doctors gave Abercrombie's bones to the side of the field before lifting the scabbard and taking it to further evaluation.
Tennessee officials told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was not available for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details on the type/scale of injuries yet" and Tennessee is trying to find out when the injuries occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He made five saves on Saturday before leaving the game, making him the 18th sack of the season.
Foreign buyers would pay higher tax-free fees when they bought property in the UK.
Foreign buyers would pay higher tax breaks when they bought property in the UK, with extra money to help homeless people under the Tory scheme.
The move would undermine the success of Corbyn's drive to attract young voters.
The tax levied on the taxpayer will be collected from non-taxpayers in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Justice is planning to raise up to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Foreign buyers are set to pay higher tax-free fees when they buy property in the UK - with the extra money used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's drive to attract eligible young people with a pledge to make housing more affordable and target high-income earners.
The tax increase will collect calls from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom along with special money that increases the government's stance in the fight against homeownership for renters.
The additional levies - beyond the current tax penalty including the introduction of higher levels two years ago on second homes and the purchase of properties to let them rent - make up as much as three percent.
The Ministry of Enforcement expects the drive to rise to up to 120 million pounds per year.
About 13 percent of new London homes have been purchased by foreigners, as rising prices make it harder to buy a first home.
Many areas of the country's rich - especially in the capital - have become "loony cities" due to the increasing number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by leasing land but not using it and urged May to abolish the gentle-style housing quota to address the "damaged housing" of the British population.
Corbyn has announced some interesting housing reforms, including a rental control and a halt to the eviction of "innocent" people.
He also wanted the cabinet to have more power to build new villages.
May said: "Last year I said I would be committed as Prime Minister to helping revive the dream of the British people - that life should be better for the new generation.
And that means the housing repair that's broken on the market.
Britain will be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not easy for non-UK individuals, as well as foreign companies, to buy a house as hard-working British people.
For many who want to have their own home, the dream has become too distant and shows that there are still many homeless people".
Jack Ross: 'My highest priority is managing Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become Scotland manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scotsman is challenging the North-East's ability to recover from a third-placed finish in League One with three draws in the top flight.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season.
"I want to play for my country.
I got the B cap and that's what Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it's something that I think about all the time.
That opportunity will come when I am successful in managing the club".
Managers before Ross as manager of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic captain said he felt no qualms about following the established name at such a big club having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is judged by 'Can I take this club to the Premier League?'
"Given the infrastructure and facilities at this club, it is beyond doubt that it is definitely fit to go to the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get to that point but I might look at my own success here if I can get the club back there".
Ross was to spend just three years in his managerial career, after an assistant spell at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell in charge of the coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier and turned St Mirren from relegation to the Championship winner in the relegation play-offs.
And Ross said he felt more comfortable than he ever did during his playing days at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It might be a real separation", he recalled Alloa's responsibility.
"I really believe that management is more suited to me, than playing.
It sounds strange because I do it well, make life meaningful and enjoy coming out on top.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
I still go through the humiliation and the pressure of the job, but team management is what I feel is right for me.
I always wanted to manage a team, and now that I'm doing it, it's more comfortable than I was before".

The summer heat has increased revenue for the UK's underserved entertainment industry but added pressure on more restaurants.
Theaters and bars had sales up 2.7 percent during July - but restaurant sales fell 4.8 percent as the figures were released.
Peter Martin, the CGA business consultant who compiled the figures said: "The continued sunshine and the unexpectedly prolonged involvement of the UK in the World Cup means that July is on a similar pattern to June, when the top stations have sales up 2.8 per cent except for the downside restaurants.
The decline in restaurant business in June fell 1.8 percent and worsened in July.
Theatres and bars that sell but drinks are the best selling and most popular than restaurants.
The restaurant is still in crisis but still not heavily in the restaurant business.
It seems people only go outside to drink.
The sales of drinks in theaters and bars are up 6.6 per month, but food is down 3 percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and tourism analyst at RSM, said: "This has been a consistent trend since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when selling to the outlets.
It's not surprising that the restaurant group is still struggling despite a 4.8 percent year-on-year decline in sales, but it's also painful to bear the pressure on the costs that come with it.
A long dry season cannot happen when it is not good for the restaurant business, and time will tell whether the temperate climate we encounter in August can compensate for more leisure time".
Growth in total sales in supermarkets and restaurants including new stores was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a decline in new store openings.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry production tracker for UK entertainment, bars and restaurants collected and analyzed operational data from 47 operating groups with a combined value of approximately $9 billion and is an established industry standard.

A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in "Insta Pop"
The news has raised fears that child pornography will be posted.
Percent of students said they had a "core" account to show their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a secret online account to keep it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed the rapid growth of the "Insta Pump" account - a document cited from photo sharing on Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be posted to children.
Percent of students said they made "main" non-hazardous lists to show parents while also having personal accounts.
One mother who accessed her 13-year-old daughter's secret website encountered a teenager who urged others to "harass me".
The research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Directorate (HMC), found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two pictures, with half of those accepting private accounting.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is alarming that so many teenagers are being tricked into creating online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Eilidh Doyle will be the "Sports Voice" of the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is one of Scotland's most acclaimed runners and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for the athlete's leader to benefit from his diverse international experience over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected throughout Scotland, the Kingdom and the global athletic community and we are sure that the sport in Scotland will benefit immensely by bringing him to the board", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be the voice of the sport and hope to be involved and lead the sport in Scotland".

He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a ruptured cerebral artery.
I can't walk.
The doctor said that only time will tell how much I will recover or return.
It's been hard work but made a full recovery, learned how to walk and is now practicing flexibility!
Thank you for your encouraging words!"
The milk advertising comparing mothers to cows has divided opinion online.
Breastfeeding companies have been divided in expressing opinions that compare breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To herald the launch of what is said to be the "world's first silent coated milkshake", consumer technology company Elvie launched a yearlong ad that inspired the independence of the new coated milkshake that gives a sense of motherhood.
The dancing mother in the farmhouse filled with the dried milk of the cow sang: "Yes, I give myself milk, but you don't see the milk", and "In case you haven't noticed it's not milk, it's my milk".
The voice continued: "Oil it, oil it, I'm feeding those children, oil it, oil it, I'm feeding my daughters".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use this to advertise this product.
"Like those who have to get pregnant and give birth to milk, unless their baby is stolen on the day of birth", one said.
Elvie's perfume fits inside the milkshake.
Another comment: "Clearly a scare for the mother and child.
But why not use them to advertise milk for mothers who choose to breastfeed their babies?"
Others added: "It's an advertisement that can't be entered at all".
Others spoke out in defense of the ad, with one woman admitting that the instrumental song was "a good ear".
"I think this is a very speculative idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Milk makes me feel like an elephant.
Advertising is tough, but I buy it for what it is.
This is a product of proportion", one wrote.
Another comment: "This is a perennial ad and is aimed at mothers who are breastfeeding (either before work or toilet) and feel like 'snakes.'"
This is not a campaign that is going to take away the decision of the dairy industry".
At the end of the video the women's group revealed that they were all dancing with perfumes hidden in their underwear.
The idea behind the ad was based on the understanding that many women who breastfeed said they felt like cows.
But Elvie's breast pump is extremely quiet, without strings or tubes and hidden inside the sweater, giving the woman freedom to move, wrap and even push out while breastfeeding.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: "The Elvie branded soft drink is a revolutionary product that deserves to be launched with pride and attention.
We want to highlight breast milk and all its unique challenges, while showing how to enjoy it and the sense of freedom that this new breast milk brings.
This isn't the first time Elvie's perfume has made the front page.

Hundreds of refugee children were quietly moved to camps on the Texas border.
The number of detained refugee children has increased despite the monthly border crossings remaining unchanged, partly due to the harsh language and policies used by the TRC to make it easier for children to have supporters.
Typically, most supporters are undocumented immigrants and are afraid to risk their ability to remain in the country by going ahead and asking for a child.
The risk increased in June, when the federal government announced that disabled supporters and elderly family members would be required to submit fingerprints and that information would be shared with immigration officials.
Last week, Matthew Albence, senior immigration and customs enforcement officer, leaked to the council that the unit had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be the advocates for children who travel alone.
The organization confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior record of sexual abuse.
"Nearly 80% of the individuals who are supporters or family members of supporters are in the country illegally and most are criminals.
So we are continuing to track the person", Mr Albence said.
Authorities have introduced new rules that would require some children to appear in court within a month after being detained for more than 60 days against previous standards, according to the Workers' Party Women's Centre.
Many people will appear via video chat instead of face-to-face to sue their case for the legal status of an immigration judge.
Those who consider themselves ineligible for aid will be deported quickly.
Children who remain in long-term care may develop anxiety or hearing loss, which may lead to violent confrontations or attempts to escape, according to reports of workers at the center who have emerged from the system in recent months.
Archaeologists say these concerns are heightened in large places such as Tornillo, where signals that children are in trouble are often overlooked due to the large size of the city.
They also say that moving children into cities without enough time to prepare mentally or talk to friends can cause injuries that many still struggle with.
Syria tells US, France and Turkey 'occupying forces' to withdraw immediately
US Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home despite the country's war in its eighth year.
Moualem, who serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally under the charge of fighting terrorism and "will be dealt with appropriately".
"They must withdraw immediately and without conditions", he told the meeting.
Moualem asserted that "the terrible war is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "in this holy fight until we cleanse the entire Syrian territory" of terrorists and "illegal foreign behavior".
The United States has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and providing advice to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in war zones.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said these conditions could be adjusted to allow them to return, and said that "some Western countries" are "spreading unjustified fear" that keeps refugees at a distance.
"We have called on international and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return", he said.
"They are making a political statement that should be a truly humanitarian statement".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the Russia-Turkey deal establishing a safe zone in the most secure group of Idlib leaders has created an opportunity to announce a political negotiation.
The Russia-Turkey deal turns a massive offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed that the agreement has a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that the military operation will eliminate terrorist targets including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which "will be eliminated completely".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN delegate hopes to hold the first meeting of a new commission composed of the government and members of the opposition to draft an anti-Syrian constitution and open elections.
Moualem proposed conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the commission's work should be limited "to reviewing the text of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Accordingly, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberal audiences may hope that the nomination and storyline will end with a presidential caucus.
In what is undoubtedly "the most grim final act of a president!"
At this time there is no sign of audience fatigue.
Since 2014, prime minister rankings have been used by more than double the 1.05 million people on CNN and nearly triple the 1.6 million people on MSNBC.
Fox News had an overall audience of 2.4 million, up from 1.7 million four years earlier, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" reached 3.5 million on a news night.
"This is a fire that is making us excited because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, ABC's production supervisor "The Definitive Life Saver", along with the secretary of state who became president after the attacks devastated the capital.
Nell Scovell, the novelist and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And the Few Truths About Breaking into the Hollywood Boys Club", has another theory.
He remembers riding a mule in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? She asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes my head spin,'" Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the chaos.
Of course, there's nothing like being on television. The blood that comes from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade whether or not the families of the refugees can return and the state of the global economy.
Change it to a premium audience that can only pay.
And even more than that, it's more than being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth hour of a panel discussion with Bob Woodward using the "deep-seated backstory" of his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 Octopus sweater ("the thick coat that comes with the sh*t", the Washington Post said) and Stormy Daniels's interpretation of Trump's fear, borrowing geography.
I'm the one who's never going to watch the old Super Mario again.
"Part of what he makes it feel like it's a reality show is he feeds you every night", Brent Montgomery of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pawn Stars" said of the spin-off of Trump's show and changed the daily episode (or fight with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't miss it, but at the same time, you can't let it go.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss this week, it was setting 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was on the sidelines watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't have come out himself, if not for Brett Kavanaugh facing the Supreme Court of the People's Court and the future of the Supreme People's Court is in balance.
"I remember when we were performing in the tapestry that day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it's true".

Money runs out of the race, midterm elections in the village
It's no wonder that the 17th state of Pennsylvania has a lot of cash thanks to the reorganization of the two congressional districts in the same seat race.
Recently there has been a boundary change in Pittsburgh, pits Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb - who won the election and added a seat to the city council last summer.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th-oldest county, covering most of the 17th-largest county.
The plan was brought back into use in the boundary issue after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old city was not permitted to divide the electoral district at the request of the Republicans.
The 17th running of the race was funded by a vote between the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a minor special election victory in the March election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by Republicans for decades and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits make the Democrats look a little bit smaller.
The US sanctions on El Salvador, backed by China, then withdrawn.
The diplomat noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already learned that Beijing has little support from Washington.
Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partner drove off Trump's corporate team.
Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said in a statement earlier this month that the State Department had decided to call U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama during the "final decision that Taiwan is no longer there", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the State Department, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions have only been considered against El Salvador, which received US aid in 2017 amounting to US$140 million, including narcotics control, development and economic support.
Sanctions, which include cutting financial aid and restricting visa issuance to target groups, could have repercussions for Central America, including high unemployment and murder rates.
While holding internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting focusing on security and economic stability to continue a similar meeting that took place this year and was a step toward protecting refugees traveling to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made clear their intentions at a meeting on the sanctions against El Salvador.
The diplomat said Vice President Mike Pence had scheduled a meeting in mid-October to signal the leaders' coming together.
And the three American diplomats have resumed discussions on the issues of El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any sanctions from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate that the three American diplomats, including the two diplomats, had mentioned, agreeing to discuss internal negotiations on the condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by outside analysts close to the executive and also mentioned the condition of anonymity.
The study of the human condition
The next event could be Robert Mueller's special report on Trump's obstruction of justice, which has now been made public with important evidence.
Mueller reported on the polling whether Trump was colluding with Russia in the attack on our election.
If the U.S. federal legislature changes, Trump will find himself facing accountability in the very body he has prepared to go before voters and perhaps even the ruthless crowd of his colleagues.
That's a lot of problems, and I don't mean to imply that Trump's failure is inevitable or that of his European counterparts.
There are many choices we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the long struggle.
In 1938, German authorities prepared to hold a protest against Hitler, if the West were to oppose Hitler and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the chance to avoid multiple murders.
Historical events such as the turning point and the unstoppable march of democracy have been accelerated or slowed.
At this time, the American people are facing these issues.
What should we do if you fire Trump's top assistant prosecutor Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of the case and the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bloody bind since reports last year suggested he secretly documented the president's actions and predicted he was unfit for office.
Rosenstein said the Times's data was inaccurate.
"What would be our response if the F.B.I.'s re-examination of Brett Kavanaugh was incomplete or unfair - or if he was confirmed by the Senate even with credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury.
And above all, are we going to vote in the middle of the session that will make Trump responsible or not?
If we fail those tests, the Democratic Party will be in a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail, because I learned from the events in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that once occupied my village.
He survived and emigrated to America, and 60 years later, my mother sent me to a wilderness destination in that sacred landmark.
When it's my legacy, how can I not see the world in a positive light about our future?

Graham Dorrans' Ranger team is looking at the world in a positive light before colliding with Rapid Vienna.
Ranger hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, winning the Austrians followed by a draw between Spain and Villarreal this month, putting them in a competitive position to go through the selection from Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans injured his knee from the first appearance of the season to a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this score to go on to win.
"It's a good score for us because Villarreal are a strong team", said the 31-year-old team member.
We entered that contest and believed that we could get something and draw it.
Sometimes we have to be full at the end, but the result is always the same.
They did better in the first half and in the second half, our team did better.
Fast forward to Thursday, another great night of the European championships.
We were hoping for three draws but it could be a tough game because the last game they did very well but with the hosts against us I believe we will be fully motivated and get a good result.
Last year was a very difficult year with everything that happened to me with my injury and the changes in the team but now it feels like something good has come in.
The training was good, the team was good and the players were enjoying the game.
We hope we can do that and put the game behind us and succeed".
Women don't sleep because they worry about saving for retirement.
Survey participants have a clear idea of how they would like to be treated, but few of those people have spoken to family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they had coached their partners on the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of those have talked to their children about it.
Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Insurance Business, said, "People want to give care to family members, but they don't start talking about it".
It should start like this.
With your spouse and children: You cannot get your family to take care of you if you don't tell them your needs in advance.
Talk to your counselor and family to discuss where the treatment facility is and how to care for it, as these options may be a major factor in determining costs.
Bring in your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you with how to pay for those expenses.
Your options for long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or insuring your own property as long as you have money.
Details of your legal document: Going back to your previous legal objection.
Buying a health care program allows you to appoint a trusted person to care for your care and ensure that the specialist will take care of your needs in case you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider your financial authority.
You may choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that you have paid for your treatment if you are unable to take responsibility.
Don't forget the little details, like if your elderly parent has an emergency to take to the hospital.
Can you give answers about medication and tell about what your parents are sick with?

The victim did not see the shooter.
His injuries were not life-threatening and police appealed against the verdict.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia's Palu province on Friday, according to official reports, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
Due to the communication disruption, peacekeepers were unable to receive information from the Donggala administrative district located north of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been displaced after the disaster in Palu.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 as of 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary as the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 kilometres (180 mi) in the north of Sulawesi.
Regency, the lower administrative region of the province, had a population of approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Mining and agriculture are the main economies of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Unit.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses were destroyed in Donggala.
The 1996 Donggala West Tsunami killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is affected by earthquakes all the time.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past year:
2004: On October 26, a major earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, north of the island of Sumatra. The quake struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A major earthquake struck off the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
More than 100 people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that swept across the southern coastline and killed more than 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the island of Mentawai causes a 10-meter tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A small-scale earthquake at Pidie Jaya in Aceh causes devastation and panic among the people as they are warned of the aftermath of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami that killed many people.
This time there was no suicide, but more than 100 people died from the tower.
2018: A major earthquake struck Lombok island but mostly in the north of the island, killing more than 500 people.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists stranded on temporary islands.
Sarah Palin's stepson is arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the son of former Alaska governor and former vice president Sarah Palin, was arrested on terrorism charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence and obstruction of arrest, according to an Alaska military report on Saturday.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance of a woman tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he pulled her phone out.
KTUU reported that Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held in an unsecured bond of $500.
He reportedly appeared in court on Saturday, was questioned, and pleaded not guilty.
Palin faces one to three felony counts, which means he could face a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a second-degree felony, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that a criminal case has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
The case is before the Military Court of Alaska.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated which was related to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of cheating on her.
Sarah Palin was previously criticized by military groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD caused by his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: more than 100 dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications systems are down due to the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
An earthquake struck central Sulawesi, which is northeast of Jakarta, Indonesia.
Videos are circulating on social media showing the timing of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach party in Palu on the day the typhoon hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for suspects in the New York attacks.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the case of Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the New York attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state for crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a Home Depot truck to attack bicycle traffic on Lower Manhattan's West Side, killing several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To pass a life sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov had the intent to kill all eight victims and to cause serious injury, according to a notice of execution in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry the death penalty, according to the court's ruling.
Weeks after the attack, the U.S. Attorney's Office charged Saipov with 22 counts, which consisted of eight counts of murder with false assistance, generally to be used by U.S. attorneys for premeditated crimes and the use of violence and vehicle destruction.
The attack would require "virtuous planning and foresight", the prosecutor said, describing the nature of Saipov's actions as "evil, cruel and cowardly".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused the illness, tragedy and loss of family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to a statement by the state.
The five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last death sentence in the Southern District of New York.
Inmate Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murders of two drug manufacturers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in New York was the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953, both of whom were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed signs of unconsciousness in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he was aware of what he had done.
Saipov told senior staff that he was motivated to attack after watching ISIS video clips on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
Police added that he had also asked to wear an ISIS flag in his room at the hospital.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the state attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
Patton said: "We think that the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of parole would be a prolongation of the impact of this event for all involved".
Saipov's lawyers have asked the prosecutor not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage has promised to "explode the army of the people" today during a protest at the Tory convention.
The former Ukip leader said politicians should be "excited" by Eurosceptics - one of Theresa May's MPs who suggested he take charge of EU negotiations.
Peter Bone, the president of the Conservative Party, says the Birmingham UK flag trip 'will come out' now if Farage is the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge Maye faces in legalizing his split was highlighted by the Tories joining the city's anti-Brexit protests.
The prime minister is scrambling to get the Chequers democracy plan going as planned amid the onslaught from Brexit, survivors and the European Union.
The coalition has confirmed that he will go ahead with an attempt to protest the deal with Brussels despite anger - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what is proposed and his 'confused' approach.
Mr Bone said that in terms of resigning from the Solihull rally he wanted 'stop Chequers'.
He suggested that Farage should consult with colleagues and take responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he's in charge, we'll leave now,' he said.
Wellingborough added: 'I will stand for leaving the EU but we need to stop Checkers.'
Citing his opposition to the European Union, he said: 'We did not fight the world war to be slaves.
We need to create our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: 'the idea that the British people have changed and still want to keep the story untrue.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, also at the rally, told reporters: 'I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers are not popular with the general public, the opposition did not vote for them, it is dissatisfied with our party and our activists and it made us get elected in the first place.
Please put down the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message directed to May, she added: "The prime minister is consistently acting when the Hoyas keep their promises".
Farage said politicians should feel 'happy' if they are going to remember the results of the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us - the people and our politicians", he said.
"They are trying to push back Brexit and we are here today to tell them 'we will not let you go out and do that.'
In a message to the excited crowd he added: 'I want to do our political studies who are going to delay Brexit, feel excited.
We are mobilizing the people of this country to give us a victory on Brexit and will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, supporters marched in Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city.
The activists' actions have sparked a backlash against the Tories Against Brexit banner following the group's launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis's colleagues blamed the Conservatives for the security issues they experienced with the parties when opening the meeting.
'These are the people who are telling us that they can have the IT system ready and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for border-free, border-free free trade in Ireland,' he added.
'It is the most magical story.
There is no good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to be elected president.
U.S. Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren has said she will work hard to be elected president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his candidacy in the midwestern Massachusetts valley on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP co-chair Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign chairman in 2016.
He is central to predicting Trump's 2020 run.
Saturday evening's event at Holyoke was the 36th meeting with eligible voters using the midterm model since Trump took office.
The delegates asked you about your presidential election plan.
Warren responded that it was time for women to travel to Washington to address government issues and include women going to the top.
Arrest in the shooting death of Sims on the LSU basketball team
Officials in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that suspects have been arrested in the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m., ET news release said.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help from one of the men seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead outside Southern University on Friday morning.
Police officer Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday on the 247sports channel that "Wayde Sims was shot in the head and ultimately killed.
Wayde came in to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, possessing a weapon and admitting to being the shooter of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was immediately arrested and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Station.
A 6-foot-6 junior who grew up on the Baton Rouge team, Sims played in all 32 games 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team ordered him to beat Sebastian Vettel
It became clear at the time that Valtteri Bottas had qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, on Saturday the Mercedes team would play a key role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas started well and almost knocked Hamilton out as he defended his own position in the first two corners and caused Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the first hole and let Hamilton run into traffic at the end of the group which should have decided to miss early.
Mercedes entered one lap behind and exited behind Vettel but Hamilton took the lead after a tyre failure that saw the Ferrari driver scrambling to get out of the way in the middle of the field without risking a rebound using the torque to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh by the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He was there, he was leading most of the race, he aimed to finish the race early and beat Kimi Raikkonen for the fourth time.
He finally got into the hole in the 44th round but could not increase speed in the remaining eight rounds because Raikkonen was fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri had done a great job all weekend and my real grandfather told me to let it go.
The team did such a good job to give one another two", said Hamilton.
That's unhealthy language.
President Donald Trump criticized lawmakers at a meeting on Saturday for her insistence that the text of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, was not released.
At the meeting in West Virginia, the president did not address Ford directly to the House Ways and Means Committee, but commented that what happened in the House showed that the people were "lower, more arrogant and less sincere".
He said: "One of the things that could happen and the most beautiful thing that happened in the last few days in the Council when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and humble and arrogant and not honest.
He added, "When you watch the news and hear the news, you say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.'
I did not.
What is the result?
Dianne Feinstein, did you release the news?
Remember his answer... he left a message about the document - Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to do that.
I didn't leave a message.
One, if you will.
We didn't release the news... No, we didn't release the news.
Feinstein sent a letter detailing the Kavanaugh allegation by Ford in July and the news was released in early September - but Feinstein denied the allegation that the rumor had left his office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not release any information about him", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
He asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret as he asked.
But his refusal was unheard of for the president, who in a Saturday night session made the comment: "I'll tell you, that's unhealthy language".
Sometimes he doesn't, but that's the most unhealthy language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexually assaulting three women, the president commented that Democrats were using the allegation to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the low-key, black-triangle, they don't care who they hit, they have to run to who to gain power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 - 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars qualified for the Elite League on Friday losing to Belfast Giants from a 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two runs on the back of a shot by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the home field advantage before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard scored the winner for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen won the double.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's men who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaull's assist, with David Rutherford by Beauvillier's assist giving the lead double four seconds later.
During the tight opening time, Sullivan brought the game back in at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt became Cownie's mentor at 15:16.
Dwyer wanted to make sure the Giants rested in the first round as he shot into the second draw at the end of the first period.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard kept them in goal level for another hard-fought game at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen give Dundee their first lead in the semi-final and he was determined to win the team's fifth-place finish in the final.
The Giants lost four of their final five games and played at home to Milton Keynes next Friday.
Air traffic controls are dead to make sure that hundreds of people in the air can escape the earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after he took his own life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board landed safely.
On Friday on the island of Sulawesi after a massive tsunami earthquake killed more than 800 people and many more were missing.
Large earthquakes continue to affect the region and many areas of Palu are filled with debris.
Despite his co-conspirator's desperate attempt to escape, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the wildly swaying air traffic control tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He was at the control tower to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
He jumped out of the airline control tower when he thought the control tower was threatening.
He later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Indonesia's Air Force Research Unit, said the decision by Anthonius Gunawan Agung could save hundreds of lives; Australian ABC News reported.
We are preparing a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks our hearts to hear about this", he added.
While authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, the country's disaster relief unit said access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was difficult and very limited.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising; as the bodies of the victims are still lying under the rubble; while many bodies are still inaccessible", journalist Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported.
The six-meter-high wave devastated Palu, which was submerged by the southern wave.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother, told Sky News: "Every day there will be a car with a dead body.
Clean water is scarce.
Shopping malls are all over the place.
Jan Gelfand, head of International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors; but we don't know what they will find on the ground.
This is a great disaster; it can be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the nationwide military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to rescuing the victims from this dangerous area.
Are you ready?" CNN reports.
Indonesia was struck by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing as many as 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini says man missing after Lagoon flight
The airline operated a flight that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia; this is said to be before the plane sank into the ocean. One man was missing after 47 passengers and crew were rescued without a fire.
Air Niugini said: "No male passengers were seen on Saturday afternoon before the evacuation".
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and search units to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to details about the age and nationality of the passenger.
After the plane crashed into the water; while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport; local rescue boats rescued the passengers and other crew.
Seven passengers were reportedly taken to hospital on Friday.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and all were in normal condition.
The exact cause of the crash and the actual events that followed are still unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said the plane made a short landing on the runway of the lagoon airport.
Witnesses reported that the plane was trying to stop at the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said: "The plane was flying very low.
"That's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers were preparing to walk through the deep water to the emergency exit of the submerged plane.
He said: "The flight attendant was confused, unable to control himself and screaming, which caused him a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that rescuers working in the vicinity to improve the harbor came to the rescue using a submarine to escort passengers ashore before the aircraft sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) in the sea.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that in the past two decades 111 PNG-registered passengers have died as a result of crashes; however, none of these are related to Air Niugini.
Analysts have revealed the night the women were burned alive.
On Saturday, the trial revealed the facts of a 2014 case involving a Mississippi male arsonist.
Analyst Paul Rowlett at the United States Department of Justice analyzed the evidence in the field for several hours.
He detailed to the jury how he used cell phone data to track the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he had learned from a source who had obtained information from a cell phone or multiple devices that Tellis had been with Chambers on the afternoon of her death; this contradicts what Tellis had claimed or previously reported from the Clarion newspaper.
When the information showed that his phone was with Chambers when he spoke he said he was with a cellmate named Michael Sanford, then the police went to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford confirmed and clarified that he was not in town that day.
When asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford's car that night; Sanford said he was "fucking crazy because my car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellis says: on the day Chambers died he had known Chambers for only two weeks.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after Chambers died, Tellis deleted the text; calls and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin shutting down the debate on Sunday.
The jury said he expected the official evidence to reach the jury later that day.
The high breed: What is the wisdom of hip-hop music?
Hip hop groups want to challenge the negative connotations of their lyrics by filling hip hop with positive or crazy messages.
The high breed: from Bristol says hip hop has shifted its original lyrics with political messages and addressing social issues.
They wanted to go back to basics and build a reputation for making hip-hop popular again.
Composers such as Fugees and Common have seen their current popularity in the UK as the work of composers such as Akala and Lowkey.
The other ghost?!
A New York nanny sues a couple who divorced themselves after receiving a "racist" message.
A New York nanny sued for racial discrimination after receiving a false message from the mother, who complained: "I'm gay again".
The husband denies that he does not discriminate against the ghost; but compares it to "spouse take advantage".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she discovered that a new nanny named Giselle Maurice, who had just arrived for her family's first day of work in 2016, was a bully.
"No more witches", this is a message Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband.
However, instead of sending a message to her husband, she sent Maurice twice.
According to The New York Times, after admitting her guilt, Plasco-Flaxman "became depressed" and fired Maurice, saying: "The African-American nanny is not doing well and so he expects to get a Filipino nanny instead".
Maurice got her day's pay and was sent home by Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for self-exclusion damages and is seeking damages of 350 DKK per day for six months at the initial agreed price; despite no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that", he told the newspaper on Friday, adding, "I know it's racist".
The couple responded to the allegation that they were racist by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a reasonable cause; they feared that they would not be able to pay her off after having wronged her.
"My wife sent something that she didn't mean.
He discriminates against people of different races.
We are not racists", the husband, Joel Plasco, told reporters.
"But how can you give your child to someone you used to treat with respect, even though you did not mean to do wrong?
What is your newborn?
Is that so?
It's a profit-making comparison", Plasco said, adding that his wife had just given birth at two months and was in a very difficult situation.
"Will you work with someone after that?
It's not a good thing to do that", the bank investor added.
While the legal process was ongoing, the public court quickly condemned the social media couples; condemning their behavior and ideology.
Paddington was concerned that when the new edition was released, readers might not be interested in the snake-eye.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to understand someone after the first reading before publication.
It's interesting to know what we know about Paddington's great achievements.
It's exciting to know what we know about Paddington's great achievements", said her father; who worked as a BBC illustrator before starting to be inspired to write a children's book from a small wooden toy; who was a positive perspective on his rejected work; said that on the occasion of the 60th anniversary the publication of the book was "sweet milk" after he died this year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "the most important member of our family", she added that her father was extremely proud of his achievements.
"He was a quiet man and he didn't like to brag", she said.
"But since Paddington is the closest thing to him; it's like having some little accomplished child: you're proud of them even if it's not a real act.
I think he might have looked at Paddington's achievements in that perspective.
Even if it is his invention and his imagination, he will still be the work of Paddington himself".
My daughter is dying, and I want to talk to her over the phone.
When his daughter's landing gear was taken to Nice's Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, the doctors were working to try to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was so brutal that he would not survive", said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in two minutes and I had to tell him the truth.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much; dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll stay with you.
The doctors kept on operating his heart, but it seemed to be slowing down, and he was gone.
He died a while ago and everything just shut down.
I just sat there and waited when I knew everything was mine.
I couldn't cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and friends.
We need to encourage each other".
Eventually Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse regrets the loss of her daughter; she passes the ticket alongside the other passengers - without her feeling how she got through the incident.
"No one knows", she said.
"I nodded and my tears flowed out all the time.
It's hard to explain but it's been a long time since I felt so sorry for Nad's loss.
My daughter needs my love and understanding.
I know how much he loves her.
Sad woman hangs suicide warning signs on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys once hung signs on the Welsh Bridge with encouraging messages and a phone number where people could call for help.
Davis's son Tyler, who was 13 years old, struggled with depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel like I feel every day", she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son is a connected world.
"Everyone knew him for his stings.
They say his tail is the glory of every room".
However, he resigned before his death, for he was "caught up in the world of darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's then 11-year-old brother was one of Tyler's cousins who saw his brother's body after he committed suicide.
Davis said: "I am constantly concerned that it may be affected.
Davis created the sign "to let people know there are people out there that you can reach out to and talk to for them.
You don't have to sit in silence - you have to speak out.
Humphreys, who had been friends with Davies for years, lost her husband Mark 15 years ago, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
"He didn't deny that he was really cheating or being depressed or something", she said.
"Two days before Christmas - we noticed that he changed his mind.
At Christmas he's like a rock - when the kids open the cages, Mark doesn't use contact lenses or react at all.
She said Mark's death was a great shock to them; but they had to go on: "It was a great trauma to the family".
It separates us.
But we must live and fight on.

Brett Kavanaugh's fate was in the balance when the FBI began its investigation.
"I think if we can get something as he asks - from a limited investigation in time; limited scope - we might bring very little evidence", Flake said on Saturday; adding that he was worried that the commission might "fail" because it was like being in the middle of a military siege.
Why do Kavanaugh and his conservative supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their wishful thinking is overshadowed by the investigation in this limited time.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away - November 6 - if the Republicans go ahead with the bad stuff; then they will get a serious blow for their efforts to get the person they want to the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush had received calls from congressional aides to get them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Bush, and to get him to meet his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI writes a report?
It could be a vote in the House of Representatives, where Republicans currently hold 51 seats and Democrats 49 in the U.S. Congress.
It is not clear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get the 50 votes in the Senate, which could allow Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue and confirm Kavanaugh's candidacy for the U.S. Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of refugees decreased.
Since Kim Jong-un's rise to power in the last seven years, the number of North Korean refugees coming to South Korea has been declining, South Korean legal experts say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's immigration ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tight controls on the North-China border and high fees to the leaders were key factors.
The North Korean government in Seoul has not made any public statements.
Most North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship.
The South Korean government in Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Korean refugees have crossed the border illegally.
Most cross the border through China, which has the longest shared border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China has said that illegal refugees are more than refugees and are forced to return to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea - technically still at war - have improved this month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Beijing to discuss key issues related to the nuclear ceasefire negotiations.
This was followed by a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed to work together to move the DPRK towards denuclearization.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of being too self-defeating to make progress on the nuclear deal.
"There is no trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in this situation, there is no way we can disarm first", Ri said at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "spiritually challenged", saying he was unfit to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "spiritually challenged" and said he was mentally unfit to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the point in a press interview Saturday at the Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but think; if women have that design they might call it 'emotional problems,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee's ruling on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denies allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were Jewish teenagers.
During the beginning of his speech, Kavanaugh was so excited that he cried and couldn't breathe as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also has a clear charge against the Democratic Party committee that accused him of "incitement and coordinated assassination" carried out by the angry mob in the wake of Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi denied that she believed Kavanaugh's evidence confirmed that he was unfit to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court because the evidence showed bias against Democrats.
"I think he has no qualities that fit himself from the words he said and the way he acted behind the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi declined when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were confirmed and if Democrats won a majority in the Senate.
"I'm going to say - right now if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, that means he's not only unfit to sit on the Supreme Court of the United States, but he's going to have to go to court again", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington, D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that on behalf of the Democrats, she was concerned about the possibility of Kavanaugh opposing the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because it was considered conservative justice.
In the affirmation, Kavanaugh was asked whether he would reverse the U.S. Supreme Court decision.
"It's not the time for a person with a mental health problem to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say it's not a miracle", Pelosi said.
And women want to control it.
It was months and years of violence that occurred and she couldn't control it because of the crying.
"We cry out when we feel hungry", said Steinem, 45, later.
"I thought it was a normal thing; what do you think?"
He went on to say, "I got help from a woman who was an executive in some areas; she used to yell at him when he was angry; but developed a technique that means when he was angry and started to yell; he would go to the person he was talking to, "You might think I was sad because I was crying.
I was angry.
And then he went on.
And I thought I was smart.
Tears can be part of the anger because they are the basis of misunderstanding.
One of my best memories of starting my career in a mostly male office; of finding myself crying out of unspoken anger, of being a woman to a guy who grabbed my neck; of a crazy manager who used to throw me up the aisle.
"Don't let them see you burn", he told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that it happened to you".
Patricia Schroeder, who later became a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was arrested for a brothel affair on a ship overseas named Monkey Business and bowed. Schroeder was nervous; he saw no reason why he would not have the idea of running for president himself.
"It's a non-consistent decision-making thought", she told me in a whisper 30 years later.
"There are actually seven candidates who are competing, and the last thing they want is another person.
Some call it "Black Snow and the Seven Kingdoms of War".
Because it was a slow campaign; he was behind the fundraising and so she vowed that she should not enter the contest until she could raise $2 million.
It's a war that's not won.
He found out that some of her supporters were giving male candidates up to $1,000 when she was only giving them $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced her resignation she would not formally run; she felt pressure - from the emotions of her supporters; embarrassment with a system that made it difficult to find funding and targeted voters harder to represent and hostility to sexism - that made her almost a wind.
"You might think I have a nervous breakdown", Schroeder said of how the press treated her.
"You might think Kleenex is a good partner for me.
I remember thinking they'd put a marker on my headstone?
"She cried out"?'"
How will the US-China trade war benefit the Chinese government in Beijing?
The opening of the China-US trade war is calm and while the cold war is still going on, the international split could be good for China in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump launched the first war earlier this year by raising tariffs on Chinese exports including solar panels and aluminum.
Most importantly, through the calculation of import tariffs, the impact is as high as 200 trillion dollars ($150 billion), which affects half of China's imports into the United States from China.
The Chinese government in Beijing has been responding every time by category; currently imposing tariffs of 5 percent to 10 percent on US goods worth up to $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the US head-on and the world's second largest economy must be permanently shaken soon.
To make Washington economically weak means to seek demand; but publicly to bow to the United States may be difficult for Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
Experts say that if China is hit by a trade war between the two countries, it could benefit China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision may be made by the US or China can create an uncontrollable situation in a country; the fact that it may be a more dangerous war than mutual recognition is before", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused analyst at the US Institute for Security Policy.
The Syrian foreign minister said:
Syria is ready to accept the return of refugees who have applied for asylum and need help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said at the UN General Assembly.
"The regional situation today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to repair areas destroyed by terrorists to rebuild the country.
The current situation is all about allowing asylum seekers to return to the countries they have left because of terrorism and the economic impact that it has on their lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still about 6 million people living in countries that need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help repair the damage to the country.
But he reiterated that it may be unacceptable from the terms of the aid or aid from countries that support the opposition.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA in the final by 16.5 to 10.5 at the National Stadium outside Paris; the host nation.
The current U.S. team has lost to European teams on European soil six times in a row and has not won a European title since 1993.
Europe scored higher when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn had 14.5 points to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson struggled throughout the tournament, hitting a goal down the water in the third quarter of the 16th hole, losing to goalkeeper Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Francesco Molinari won his round; becoming one of only four players to score an unprecedented 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth scored 5&4 to be placed in the bottom of the European team with Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's leading goalkeeper is Dustin Johnson, down 2 and 1 Ian Poulter of England to be the final goalkeeper.
The eight-time defending champion was Spanish rider Sergio Garcia, who became the European champion each time with 25.5 points.
"I never cried; but now I can't help it.
It was the year of the landing.
So thank you, Thomas, for bringing me on the team and for believing in me.
I am very proud and happy to have won the award again.
It's about the team and I'm happy to be able to help the team", Garcia expressed his feelings after the win.
He sent the lights on to his follower John Ram who was able to beat the US golf course Tiger Woods 2&1 by a single play on the day of the event.
"I feel it was a tremendous pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods; I grew up following that guy", said 23-year-old quarterback John Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and is currently 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An odd statistic from one of the greatest golfers of all time; having won 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team battled all weekend to hold the field with no exceptions except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who were the top players throughout the tournament.
With Team USA, Jim Furyk said after the game, "I'm proud of these goalies; they fight.
It was this time of morning when we got the heat in Europe.
We lost.
The powder is on Thomas's head.
He's a great team leader.
12 of his players played very well.
We're going to get together again; I'm going to work with the PGA of America and the Ride Club Board and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 people and I'm very proud to be part of the team.
You have a reward.
We played very well".
The latest on Red Tide: is happening in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
The latest reports from the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission indicate that the Red Tide is slowing down in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC report, the state of the rainbow is occurring in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - meaning there is a significant decline.
The seaweed in Red Tide extends over a broad 130-mile stretch of coastline from north of Pinellas to south of Lee Community.
Patches can be found as far as 10 miles from the coast of the Hillsborough community but only in a few locations in the last week.
The Red Tide phenomenon is also observed in the Pasco community.
Incidents in or off the coast of the Pinellas community have been reported in the past week; low-profile incidents in the Hillsborough community offshore; and increasingly in the Manatee community and medium-to-high-profile incidents in the Charlotte community and high-profile incidents in or off the coast of the Lee community and low-profile incidents in the Collier community.
The phenomenon continues to be reported in the communities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the past week; the most unreported cases were in northwest Florida.
