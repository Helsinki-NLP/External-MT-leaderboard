Our Cosmic Visitor: The Giant Asteroid 2014 JO25
There are billions of more giant asteroids in the solar system that circulate empty and may lead to serious consequences when they collide.
These objects, which may have closed or open orbits left from the formation of the Sun, can sometimes pass through the Earth.
The 650-meter diameter asteroid 2014 JO25 will be such a visitor and will pass 1.75 million kilometers away, which is the closest location to Earth today at 14:24."
We have heard more and more of this kind of news.
The main reason for this is the development of observation techniques and observation tools.
This allows us to identify smaller asteroids that have not been previously identified.
For example, in January, a bus-size asteroid had passed only half (~250,000 km) of the distance between Earth and the Moon.
And even more interesting asteroid could be determined just a few days before the passage.
So there may be other cosmic buses that come to us right now.
Think what would you do if you got the news that an asteroid with a diameter of 20 meters would fall in the middle of your neighborhood?
In fact, asteroids of this size will not destroy your neighborhood but the windows of all buildings will probably explode.
This will also be due to the shock waves spread from the asteroid that will infiltrate in the atmosphere.
For example, the asteroid that fell to Russia in 2013 was in these dimensions and was enough to break down the windows of buildings in several cities.
But if you are in the neighborhood of an asteroid with a diameter of 100 meters, you are advised to go at least 50 km away from your neighborhood.
Criteria such as the size of the asteroid and the angle of collision are the factors that determine the depth of the crater that will form and the damage that the collision will cause.
According to the simulation of the European Space Agency, let’s look at a few scenarios.
If an asteroid with a diameter of 100 meters hits Earth at a 45-degree angle at a 60 km/s speed, it will form a crater with a depth of about 250 meters and a diameter of 1200 meters.
The collision is equal to a earthquake of 6 magnitude according to the Richter scale, and even if you’re 10 km away from the collision point, you’ll have 3 degree burns in your body.
The 50 km passers will be waiting for the broken windows.
If an asteroid hits a diameter of 1 km, the situation becomes even more inner dark.
If such a asteroid hits Earth with the same angle and speed value, it will form a crater at approximately 600 meters deep and with a diameter of 12 km.
That is, a whole neighborhood turns into a crater and disappears immediately.
Even if you are 100 km away from the point of collision due to the heat resulting from the collision, a third degree burning occurs in your body.
The earthquake is equal to a earthquake of 8 magnitude according to the Richter scale.
The damage that the asteroid will cause depends not only on the chemical composition of the asteroid, but also on the rock structure of the area that it will hit.
The above values are given according to the scenario that occurs when a hard rock-like asteroid falls into a area of tortuous rock.
If the asteroid is mostly made of iron, it falls to a surface that is formed by the cooling of the laws, the size of the crater will increase three times, and the consequent catastrophe will be tolerated.
66 million years ago, it was worse for the dinosaurs and they suffered a catastrophe resulting from an asteroid of about 10 km diameter.
As a result of the asteroid collision, 75 percent of the marine and terrestrial animals have been immediately destroyed.
If this great asteroid that destroys dinosaurs has targeted Earth, make sure the strongest option will be to leave the planet.
Thousands of tons of matter falls to Earth every day from space.
Most of them are burned in the atmosphere.
Some asteroids, which are large enough, burn in the atmosphere and cause brightnesses known as star switches among the peoples.
Let’s finish with another news that will relax.
Studies show that a huge asteroid is not expected to hit Earth that will cause very serious destruction over the next 300-400 years.
As an average of 70 years of life, I’m sure you’ve been relaxed.
Flash claim for Medel: 10 million euros!
The name of the Black-White on the agenda of the Stoper area is clearly seen by Gary Medel to leave Inter.
The 30-year-old footballer who went on a vacation after dressing in the Confederation Cup with his shape in Chile and began working again with Inter in recent days, is waiting for his future offers.
From the prestigious Italian newspapers, Gazzetta dello Sport suggested that Beşiktaş for Medel, who can serve both in the stoper and front libero area, made an offer of 10 million euros to Inter.
The Black and White, who offered their offer to Medel, said they were waiting for an answer from both sides, while the Chilean footballer said he was looking hot to live with his family in Istanbul.
Despite this claim by Gazzetta, it is quite difficult for the Black Eagle, which is the FFP limit, to pay a price of 10 million euros for Medel.
The black and white are likely to add the star player to the team if they first turn to Medel by rental, as in Caner Erkin transfer, or if a serious discount is made in the conserve.

Human Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National People's Progress Association has issued a warning for colourful people to travel to Missouri due to the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement is as follows: "The Missouri State NAACP Travel Advisory Declaration, which is in force from 28 August 2017, gives African-American travelers, visitors and Missouri citizens special attention and very caution when traveling from the beginning to the end of the state, as indicated there, due to the recent suspicious, racial-based events that occur throughout the state."
NAACP said that a new Missouri law makes it difficult for people to win cases of discrimination, and that the state’s legal practice is disproportionately targeting minorities, which is effective in the group’s publication of this travel warning.
“There are human rights violations that happen to people.
They are stopped, beaten and killed because of their skin color,” said Rod Chapel, president of the Missouri NAACP, to Kansan City Star.
“We hear any complaints that we have not heard before.”
This is the first time the association has issued such a warning to a state in the United States.
The group showed examples of racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a black man from Tennessee, Tory Sanders.
In early this year, Sanders was arrested and killed under suspicious circumstances by the Missouri police after the fuel ended while passing the state.
The recommendation statement also highlights a new report by the Missouri Prosecutor's Office that shows that black drivers in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
Chapel said, “The advice message is to keep people awake and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might be in Missouri.”
“People should be ready to bring the money of misery with them, to inform their relatives about their going to pass through this state.”
In Missouri, according to the latest figures in the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were committed in 2015, which puts the state on the 16th place in the country in terms of the number of similar offences.
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law in which it is more difficult to complain of discrimination against a place of work, when renting a home or giving a job.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Association (ACLU) has issued travel advice for Texas and Arizona, after the local executive authorities of these states have passed immigration law that orders people to be arrested for immigration violations; ACLU says it will increase their practices by race.
Travel warnings are often published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently defence groups have applied to this practice in response to a series of laws and trends within the United States.
I’m good at Demba Ba.
Demba Ba, who transferred the Chinese team to Shanghai Shenhua for 13 million euros 2 season ago and rented to the Black and White between the season last, returns to Beşiktaş for free.
The Black Eagle, who asked for a detailed health report from the Senegal player last week, took action after the report from the star footballer.
The Black and White administration, which began working for the 32-year-old player that the Chinese representative did not think about in the next season, struck the door of the Shanghai team.
Not included in the list
Demba Ba, who was not listed on the list because of his foreign status in China, told the government that he wanted to return to the Black and White.
The Chinese team has approved the departure of the 32-year-old player.
The Senegal footballer is expected to come to Turkey in the coming days to sign an official contract.
Castillo was operated in Trabzonspor
In a statement on the website of the Bordo-Mavili club, Castillo said he had an arthroscopic meniscus operation from the left edge at the Istanbul Liv Hospital, "Prof. Dr. Uğur Haklar's postoperative player is expected to start training with the team within 4 weeks."
Castillo was injured from his right back in the preparation match with the Dutch team Heerenveen in the Slovak camp.
The Colombian player, who was announced to stay away from the field for 3-4 weeks due to his treatment, was decided to be operated due to the meniscus problem he had previously experienced.
Parliament from Barzan.
Barzani made a speech at the commemoration ceremony held in the city of Duhok due to the 3rd anniversary of the terrorist organization ISIS' attack on the Ezidis in the Sincar district of Mosul.
In his speech, referring to the independence referendum IKBY wants to hold on September 25, Barzani said: "I have to say this with regret, we have no hope that Iraq will be a right and right country."
We tried all the ways with Iraq but we were completely disappointed and desperate.
The past experiences we have lived with Iraq have brought us into this situation and there is no guarantee that we can take our rights and protect them.
So we must show that we all can determine our fate to the whole world through a referendum to ensure life and security together.
I also need to draw gold; my referendum is not a goal for us but a tool for us to a greater goal.
Barzani reminded that the Iraqi central government had many promises to the Kurds after the fall of the Baas regime in 2003, saying that the catastrophe in Sincar occurred very soon, saying that a direct referendum decision was made after the fight with ISIS.
Barzani said that the IKBY people want to determine their fate in a peaceful and democratic way for their self-protection and development, "The documents showed that Iraq cannot or does not want to protect us as a state."
“We don’t want to move forward,” he said.
During the fight against the terrorist organization ISIS, Barzani noted that the central government of Iraq did not give them weapons but that in a short time with a fetva established Hashdi Shabi was immediately legalized and all the weapons were provided:
In the Iraqi defence system, there was no interlocutor.
The central government did not do what he offered to Hashdi Shabi to Peşmerge.
Peshmerge is considered a part of the Iraqi defense system according to the Constitution.
But while Haşdi Shabi had no existence in the constitution, all possibilities were dismissed by violating the laws.
We don’t say we are against Shabi.
Peşmerge and Haşdi Shabi fought on the same front, and why, on the one hand, Haşdi Shabi was legalized, the existence of Peşmergen and the fight against terror are covered.
These are our deep wounds with Baghdad.
The terrorist group ISIS on August 3, 2014 attacked the Ezidites living in the Sincar district of Mosul and killed many people, including women and children.
Returned in 10 minutes.
The airline’s Boeing 777 passenger aircraft was in the west of Hokkaido, northern Japan, while the North Korean missile was in air.
Authorities that the missile crashed in the area where the aircraft was located 10 minutes ago and estimated that the missile was approaching the aircraft about 100-150 kilometers.
Air France that the missile did not cross the route of the aircraft and there was no problem in the flight.
"The information we have at this stage shows that the missile fell to the sea more than 100 kilometers from the route of the aircraft," the statement said.
Nothing is sacred, right?
Trump's White House is now targeting Freedom Statue
The most accurate sign of regime change is that they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans know the capabilities of it as much as any one; it is, of course, the cautious overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003 at the Firdos Square in Baghdad.
Stephen Miller, one of the key theorists of the Trump regime, from CNN, with Jim Acosta, the president, in a harsh debate on the proposals to strictly restrict legal immigration, knew exactly what he did while symbolically destroying the Statue of Freedom.
To be fair, Miller's statue didn't attack him.
If he did it, the owner of a full boat tour and the imitators of Freedom would link him.
But he attacked his significance and especially the significance attributed to him after 17 years after the monument itself was completed in 1903, adding the famous poem of Emma Lazarus to the monument base.
“I don’t want to talk about history here from the beginning to the end, but the Statue of Freedom... The light of American freedom is a foolish symbol for the world.
The poem you mentioned was later added and is not part of the original Freedom Statue.”
Miller really is right, but as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This is about the contemporary reflection of Lazarus’ frightening words, in which only a state appears to invite not only some elderly migrants but also the poor to the poor: “The tired, the poor, / the pressed crowds desire to take the breath of freedom, / the pressed crowd desire to take the breath of freedom.”
There’s never been a time when the “most unwanted” was so visible on our screens.
Miller did not bring any literary criticism; he explained that these people were not welcomed by Trump in the United States.
The conflict about the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is actually a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and his friends who campaigned to put his words on the foundation of the statue after his death knew very well that they had taken a very political action.
The statue was intended to push up the links between the French and American Republicanism and to celebrate with a mosque, representing the arrival of Freedom in the body in the form of a woman.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in his poetry the female figure was no longer abstract, it had a voice.
And he gives him a very different name: the Mother of the Expelled.
The poet’s image of marriage is an abominant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American anti-immigrant.
And just as the same Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right men have long wanted to replace it.
Rush Limbaugh, a great speaker of Baptist John style for Trump’s arrival, claimed in 2010 that Freedom was a early-day neocon that didn’t invite anyone to enter, but was more likely to keep the American fire in a dark world: “Mrs. Freedom stands out.
He has to move freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
It is not for me to light the way to the United States.”
In a very unusual way, Limbaugh had actually discovered something.
The significance of the statue was entirely related to the perception perspective.
Lazarus’ wonderful creative action was to see it as if it was seen by people who were exhausted, destroyed but hopeful in their vessels after long and mostly terrible trips.
It was really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking a refuge and wanting to improve their lives.
His statue responded to them with hopeful words and the warm welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, this is not a perspective that Miller and Trump will find right in any way.
Their mind is not to guide, but to diminish hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black praises the Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers when only two Scots could enter the UK team.
UK Athletics Performance Director Neil Black says the 16-person Scottish team in the World Championship team will make "a huge contribution to the team".
The record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 starting on Friday.
Black believes that "some things are developing" in Scotland and that UK athletics should learn from it.
Black, "We accept this and we're trying to understand it and we're going to deal until it comes out."
“I’m talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s about what they’re doing.
The Swedish athletics think it’s about what they do.
British athletics: They think it’s about what they do.
The man in the street, too.
Whatever the combination of conditions is, this is definitely great.”
Many Scottish athletes, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah at 5000 m, compete for the medal, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as captain by the team.
“Eilidh is a little humble volunteer.
The captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
“Whether they’re Scotland or where they live or train, a few athletes were very proud of that room and were really motivated.
The passion and real feeling Eilidh naturally added was wonderful.”
Athlete with the Silver Medal from the United Nations, who will compete at 400 m in his fifth World Championship, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.
The total number of Scotland's best athletes in previous world championships was the seven achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Last year, five British and two European record breaking, the middle-distance runner Muir led.
1500 m and 5000 m will participate.
Chris O'Hare, who has spent a very good season, including British Team trials and victories at the Year's Eve Games, runs at 1500 m, is another Scott who will be watched.
Doyle remembers his first champion, the other single Scotch in the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain says he is "very proud" of the move that many nurses will not only enter the team but in some cases will compete for the medal and give the struggle to stay in the finals.
"The special thing to be a team captain is that it was with the votes given by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor, but knowing that your team members have voted for you and that they have chosen you made it extra special for me."
“I am proud of all the Swedish players who are in my team.
This shows how long we are going.
And they are here, as self-proof athletes, as athletes who keep out of the podium.
What about Captain’s speech?
Yes, I think it went well.
I have taken advantage of the fact that we are very lucky in this case, in this sense, there is a World Championship in our home.
That is, in fact, the effect of being able to benefit only from this inner field support and the fact that we have returned to the Olympic Stadium is that we are successful.
I’m taking a second chance to get out there and fight, and there’s a great atmosphere.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can’t remove voters’ criticism, don’t be a candidate for government
Our country's father had some information about having a negative position in the press.
The Americans loved George Washington but it didn’t take a long time that the newspapers began to criticize him seriously about everything, from his domestic politics to his political principles.
I was disturbed by criticism.
He did not silence those who criticized him.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be eliminated and we can be thrown to the coast in a stupid and quiet way."
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work more to be like Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
The American Civil Liberties Association also prosecuted him at the beginning of this week.
The governor's staff did not care because the case was un serious and the online comments were full of "who's interested?" reactions.
Many people say, “This is just Facebook.”
But that is important.
This is especially important when there is someone like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor, which is surprisingly popular in a state that is mostly Democratic.
It has the second highest tax rate among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a crazy fire.
He led his state and demonstrated mastery in strict commitment to the principles.
After chemotherapy, he was very skillful in using Facebook as the primary tool to connect with his voters.
That is, to prevent people from coming to the governor’s page, which is a public forum, officially qualified and managed by the members of the staff who pay the public’s tax dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's female spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's execution, claiming that blocking comments is not more than regulating them.
But it’s easy to use trolls or images of spammers or hateful people who are doing oral attacks online.
The Post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people who speak only to the chosen leaders: a teacher, a business owner and a priest; not a troll.
They all said their comments were not respectful, thoughtful and cursed.
The priest made a quote from the Bible by referring to Hogan's Catholic faith in his sharing.
Maryland Bowie's lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani was not hated but asked questions about hated crimes.
"I made a negative comment that I was disappointed by his hatred crimes and other recent news."
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people comment on the same topic, some of them are immediately ignored as a collective effort than a large group of worried citizens.”
What the governor’s staff calls “intensifying spam attack” others will probably call it “thought defence”.
The Facebook period makes it easy to fit a message by blocking an opponent or deleting a negative message.
The staff is far cleaner than the old days when they were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical letters, or when protesters should be arrested and silent.
But, even digital, that’s exactly what happens.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for dismantling Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being brought to court by Twitter users who have been blocked.
One of the decisions on this issue that could be referred to in the future came from Virginia last week.
The chairman of the Board of Auditors of the Loudoun Administrative District, according to the U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, acted against the First Constitutional Amendment when a voter was banned on Facebook.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (Republican) was also visited by ACLU due to the use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the fair-priced postal era had a very similar effect to the internet.
Between 1775 and 1800 the number of newspapers doubled by four, and unknown writers overturned his leadership.
Even then, Washington had unknown trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" all wrote letters to the newspapers that stumbled Washington's decisions.
According to the online George Washington Articles Project, which gathers historical documents, requests that criticize his position in relation to the Friendship, Trade and Travel Agreement with Britain have disrupted the office.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, of opposition and of expression is the core of our nation.
True leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes his home will be in the comfort of the Renaissance Club
An old number of Europe, Ronan Rafferty, hopes that in the next three days, the Renaissance Club in South Lothian will be in the comfort of his home while hosting the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
In Archerfield Links, the Northern Irish, who came to the final by leading the next door before losing Paul Eales, feels a new place of commitment and acts as the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO, Jerry Sarvadi.
Rafferty said, “I’ve watched the Renaissance Club’s construction and we see it becoming glorious with this organization.”
Players will see the field in the best way, in a wonderful situation.
Jerry made a great job by setting up this place.
He is an unprecedented defender of this game and is proud of his success here.
This is a great show for this field.”
Although the British Eales won both the Europen Tour and the European Challenge Tour, he will fight for the first time in his 32-year career to defend a championship.
The Southport-based player said, “This really feels special.”
“I didn’t have the chance to defend Extremadura Open because it was removed from my calendar for the next year I won.
It is great to go back to this part of the world.
A great place to play golf.
Memories from last year are reviving and it was very special to win last year for me and my wife Sharon.
It was a very special time that we will always remember with love.”
Gary Orr, who took part in the European Senior Tour at the beginning of this year, returns to the game in his own field.
This organization will be the first Scottish competition since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburgh man Orr said, “When you fight inside it always means a little more meaning.”
“You want to do good, but you feel more pressure.
I really playing again and played basically golf.
I am happy to go so far.”
The participants in this triangle are former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation is free and there is parking; £5 per car with a person and £10 per car with two or more people.

I found the answer
The budget is more than the budget allocated to each of the ten ministries, including Economy, Development, Energy and Natural Resources, Science Industry and Technology, Environment and Urbanism, Health, Culture and Tourism Ministries.
The number of employees is 117 thousand 378.
The biggest “propaganda base” in Turkey!
Yes, I am talking about the President of the Divine Affairs!
Yes, I will talk about the President of the Dianet Affairs Mehmet Görmez!
I have been looking for answers to the questions in my mind for a long time.
I wonder why Mehmet Görmez was taken out of the seat.
I have read every article about his submission.
No is.
I can’t find the answer to the question I’m looking for.
At the beginning of this year...
Mehmet Görmez has prepared the Dianet Affairs President's (DIB) 2017-2021 Strategic Plan.
President Erdogan has dropped the Mercedes S 600 model of £1 million.
There was no problem with Erdogan.
So what happened?
You can say, “Seven years in office is not enough.”
The first DIB president, M. Rıfat Börekçi, has been in office for 17 years.
You all know that Mehmet Nuri Yılmaz has been sitting on that seat for 11 years.
The President’s term is open.
The question is, why did he leave his seat?
The work went down...
The Shia proximity
A source close to the authority said: "According to the traditional ulema, Muhammad is not able to obtain the Sunnah!"
The code of this phrase is: He did not possess Sunnity!
The person who sparked this phrase sparked behind it: "The modernist was found by the traditional ulema!"
Meanwhile, it was unreasonable to be an innovative.
What is Innovation?
The answer to the question was hidden in a foreign trip by Mehmet Görmez.
Date: 27 December 2015.
Mehmet Görmez went to Iran to attend the 29th Vahdet Conference, which will be held in Tehran - aimed at bringing the Islamic disciples closer to them.
The religious leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Hamaney.
He made the prayer with his people.
And at the conference he said: "Mezhepler are human messages formed over time, representing different ideas and concepts in the understanding of the Islamic religion."
The purpose of all of them is to determine the position to God.
Every one of them is on a line toward the main path, but the place where they will arrive is the same.
It is never acceptable to identify the religious or to see the religious membership above the Islamic membership.
Separation, separation, and conflict are the reflection of disbelief and ignorance.
The most damaged of the religions was the religion itself.
I would like to emphasize again by drawing gold here:
Suns and Suns are a single community.
“No one can repent another because he perceives Islam as he understands or does not live.”
A year later...
The 30th Vahdet Meeting was held only by the Caferi leader Selahattin Özgündüz from Turkey.
So...
It is not wicked.
The visit of Mehmet Görmez to Iran and his speech at the conference made him the target of the "traditional uleman".
No one who represented the Turkish state in the next Tehran conference - again - was bound to participate.
He had not been invited four times since he came to office.
The reason was clear; the anti-Shi-Iran “traditional ulema” in the DIB!
Immediately after the tour to Iran, from the beginning of 2016, the seat of Mehmet Görmez began to be destroyed.
At the beginning, the Deputy Prime Minister of the DIB was rescued!
“Mehmet Görmez was so drowned that he asked him to get connected to the DIB presidency.”
In the essence...
There was a difference in view of the state.
As the theoretical worlds were formed in Saudi Arabia and Egypt's medres, the "traditional ulema" identified Sunnity - in the shadow of the United States - with Vehhabi-Selephism!
These were Iranian opponents who did not even tolerate the trip to Tehran.
The words of Kubeli Ahmet about Mehmet Görmez were not surprising: "Diyanet was not dangerous of this."
“O my Lord, let the nation be belonged to the people, and a good journey be made faithful to the people.”
They used "Ehlishness" as a symbol of Iranian hostility.
The anti-Iran anti-FETO – supported by the CIA – was now carrying out new names.
In addition to the fate...
The photo of a young man with a whisky in his hand was served to the media with a lie "Mehmet Görmez's son"!
What a coincidence!
Who made the biggest opposition to Mehmet Görmez in the media: the US-led Lightning Society's newspaper in Turkey!
After all...
The Sunnihood is not to be brought to the Saudi Vehhabi-Selefi line.
The one who doesn’t make the separation...
A religious man, his consciousness was destroyed by the “traditional ulema” created during the Cold War.
The U.S. cultural imperialism continues to rapidly Arabize Turkey (to make Vehhabi-Selefi).
Do not hesitate that the future President of the Divine Affairs will be the Vehhabi-Selefi representative!
“We are supporting Turkey’s sovereignty.”
Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu visited China for an official visit.
A joint press conference was held at the State Hospital in Beijing with Chinese Foreign Minister Vang Yi.
Vang said: “We hope that Turkey will be more active in international matters.”
China will support Turkey in its efforts to protect its sovereignty, stability and security.
“We hope that the issue of Palestine will be resolved with the international community including Turkey.”
In connection with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, Çavuşoğlu said: "Turkey, in search of close cooperation with regional and international organizations, international organizations are not an alternative to each other, but a complementary."
Spirituality officially begins its second period.
Hassan Rouhani's presidency, who won the presidential election in Iran in May, was approved by the country's leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney.
Hassan Rouhani, who was elected President for the second time in Iran, swore at the ceremony in which the country's religious leader Ayetullah Ali Hamaney also attended.
In addition to high-level military and political names as well as representatives of foreign countries attended the ceremony, Turkish Ambassador to Tehran Rıza Hakan Tekin took part on behalf of Turkey.
Ruhani, who will be president for four more years, will officially begin his office after the swear ceremony to be held in the parliament on Saturday, August 5.
The event is expected to be attended by the Minister of Economy of Turkey, Nihat Zeybekçi.
Safety measures at the border door
From the Cilvegözü Border Gate in the Reyhanlı district of Hatay, humanitarian aid, food, medication, and cleaning materials will not be allowed to pass the materials carried out.
According to the information obtained, the Babel Air Border Gate, located near the Turkish border, and due to negative security conditions in the region, the Cilvegözü Border Gate, humanitarian aid, food, medicine and cleaning materials were closed for shipping.
Assistance from the border door is allowed.
There is no information about how long the limitation will last.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Country of Indonesia
Bardina Degei doesn’t eat when cooking.
They rarely use a container.
The housewife puts a sweet potato, often known locally as "nota" in the wooden house in Enarotali, in Papua, the quiet area of Indonesia, in the Paniai castle, directly on the fire.
After half an hour, the disclosed butter is taken and washed with appetite, without washing the hands.
Degei is sitting on the stumbling floor, doing angarya work like washing the clothes with dark water from the nearby basement, without any furniture.
A cow in a roofless house sees the work of the sacral helm.
He was the youngest of his four wives in no field.
Diversity is normal here.
Of course, working until late hours can be dangerous: most of the men in the village are unemployed and most of them drink a lot, and there are soldiers.
“No one goes to the village after 5 a.m.”
After a controversial referendum in which only 1026-year-olds were forced to vote forced by public evacuation before the unions occupied in 1969, an uncommon instant view of the everyday life in the mountainous areas of a former Dutch colony in Papua, which was absorbed by Indonesia.
A current movement that propaganda independence against the Dutch government has directed anger to the Jakarta government, which has rapidly preserved its strict control over the region, banned foreign journalists or rights surveillance organizations.
In 2003, the region was formally divided into Papua and West Papua, as the independent Papua New Guinea would occupy the eastern part of the island.
The Enarotali is as far as it is; the journey to this area includes a 90-minute flight from the regional capital Jayapura to Nabire and a 5-hour car ride with a rental car.
No public transportation.
The town of 19,000 people contains wooden houses surrounded by bamboo roofs, wrapped iron roofs converted into various yellow brown tones by the pad.
Let the journalists, very few Indonesians have travelled here and almost no foreigners have travelled here.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, they worshipped the Mee Pago Papua to a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
Degei meant his vibrant, touched shirt, dark shirt and bright shirt, saying, "We were not used to wearing these clothes."
“We used to wear only leaves on our body.”
Papua is the poorest region in Indonesia, where 28% of people live below the poverty limit and with the worst multiple deaths and reading rates in Asia.
But this is also the golden land of Indonesia.
Grasberg, the world’s largest and most profitable gold mine owned by Freeport McMoran in Phoenix, is just 60 miles away from Paniai, a mountainous area of New Jersey size and home to 153,000 people.
Only in 2015, Freeport exported gold and copper worth approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua is estimated to have $78 billion reserve.
Nevertheless, these wealths, which are a source of misery for the Papua, make it possible for the powerful army of Indonesia to maintain a devastating existence.
The 2005 study by the New York Times reports that Freeport paid about $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including a fee of up to $150,000 to a single officer.
The call for more autonomy of the papua is threatening this golden egging chicken, and it is mercyful of its rights.
According to rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed by the Indonesian army since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
The mass massacres in the 1970s in the mountains of Papua have reached the numbers of genocide according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Only last year the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
The 2016 Brisbane High Bishop’s “We’ll Lose Everything” report contains the witnesses of the massacre, such as the previous year’s unlawful execution, torture (as another report says, rape and electric execution are popular) and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to calculate the number of victims because there’s events every week,” says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at the Human Rights Watch.
The pressure was increased because the sources of Papua brought settlers from other places in Indonesia.
The region’s 3.5 million population is 83% of Christians, but the demography changes as Muslim migrants from Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi, the crowded islands of Indonesia, come for economic purposes.
Javali warung buffles sell gado-gado served with peanut sauce, mixed with frozen chicken and vegetables.
Local people are hard to compete.
“Migrants sell chicken and vegetables in traditional markets cheaper than the indigenous papua,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai resident, who moved to the regional capital Jayapura for business.
"This caused the indigenous Papua, the Papua moms (women) to lose the market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, more known as Jokowi, promised to resolve inequality and rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
While the former gangster was moving on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Panaia, took the game.
But very little has changed in Papua and today the local people feel deceived.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that justice will re-establish our hope,” says You.
In fact, Paniai was in the worst situation just two months after Jokowi began his office in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children spoke Christmas songs in front of a feast fire in Enarotali, where two Indonesian military darkness broke out on a motorcycle.
The fearful children told them they should open their lamps.
One of the soldiers included his arms and, according to the local priest Yavedt Tebai, he later returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said that a group of alcoholic soldiers were pursuing the group and that their weapons were hit with their folders.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
The 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, one of the children, was so badly slaughtered that he went into coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government election committee was shot down and the events climbed the next day.
Approximately 1,000 Papual men, women and children gathered to demand justice in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center.
They were carrying the ceremonial hunt and dancing the waita of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua (riding in the form of the peoples and imitating the flocking of birds).
Some protesters began to throw stones to the police and the military garnison.
The soldiers were sent an order through the internal radio: "If the crowd shows more than three times resistance, kill them by shooting," a official document seen by TIME, which was not revealed to the local media, said.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of the Kego Koto neighborhood in Enarotali, saw the nearby danger and called the crowd for their return home and demanded calmness.
No one intended to listen.
In the presenting of the wooden house painted with bright colors, he told TIME, "When I turned back, I was suddenly shot by my left arm."
Kayame still doesn't know who was shooting, but he says the bullet came from the gathered military erasure.
“They’ve been shot many times,” he said.
According to his cousin, Alfius Youw was shot three times.
Like many Indonesians, Yohanes, known only by a single name, said, “I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was.”
“I saw him dead, I kissed him.”
Papua Police Chief Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only "under safety" because the station was under attack.
Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo, head of the branch, said in 2015, "We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us."
“This is a matter of death.”
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many injured.
The news of the deaths arrived in Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi made an enthusiastic speech in Jayapura, saying he shared the suffering of the victims’ families and promised to resolve the historic misconduct in Papua.
“I want this problem to be resolved immediately so that it won’t happen again.”
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established a non-judicial mechanism for historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the violations were long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and some in the early 2000s.
The issue is that we are determined to resolve these violations, but there are processes we need to go through.”
On June 5, Wiranto spoke to TIME, saying there was no plan to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
He said, “Everything will be resolved by the law.”
Wiranto, who accused B.M. of "crimes against humanity" related to more than 1,000 deaths during the bloody independence vote in 1999 in East Timor, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including the Paniai incident, have already been resolved.
The families of the Paniai victims welcomed such claims with a painful doubt.
“I’ve been visited four times in the last three years, but there’s been no progress,” says Johannes.
“I was tired.”
Years later he says he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid to be arrested by a soldier, I’m afraid to be shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeats the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was shot by a soldier after helping four of the victims to be buried.
“After he had buried the soldiers, the soldier came to call me.”
The attacks have not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shoot the peasants in the neighborhood of Paniai, Deiyai.
A man was killed and 17 people were injured in the strike between the countryside and the head of a building company who refused to help bring a man who was not in his home to the hospital.
The 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a nearby lake while fishing, died while he went to the hospital.
Angry peasants protested in front of the company’s building office.
Police said the peasants threw stones to the officials, and they also reacted by a warning shot.
But the indigenous people say that the moving squad (Indonesian paramilitary police) shot the crowd and killed someone.
The 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnesses the healing of the wounded, tells TIME, “We were very panicful, we were afraid of being revoked.”
“I’m hiding in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament called for the responsibility of the officers involved in this work and the movement of the police station to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a problematic area for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the dissatisfaction of the peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live dispersed along the green mountain center of Papua.
Many of them joined the Rebellion Army of the Free Papua Movement (OPM), which claimed to protect the rights of the Papua by carrying out random attacks and by carrying out kidnapping attacks on Indonesian soldiers.
Some top OPM leaders, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya, come from Paniai.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and held by soldiers in recent years as pleasant under the "protection of national sovereignty".
Some of them are never seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as "a tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty causes dissatisfaction.
A little rice in sale in Enarotali is very expensive for the indigenous to buy.
Bread is not available.
People here cultivate everything they eat: mainly the note, as well as some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is the job of women who can eat sweet potatoes in four or five fields.
They usually store most of the harvest for the family, the rest they sell in the local market.
10 notes only make 10,000 Indonesian rupee (75 cents).
With time, economic inequalities between the indigenous Papuails and Nabire Airport have grown since the opening of new air routes.
The jobs that are already less often go to migrants who are better educated and wealthy.
It is very rare for the Papua to have the capital or the necessary qualities to perform their own business competitively.
Panai Council Chairman John Gobai says, "Young people are not interested in staying in the village because there is no business or money here."
Tecrit keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Furthermore, the restrictions on communication for international media are strictly standing.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua, despite their rarely granted video shooting permission, due to "the lack of coordination with the relevant institutions".
According to Phelim Kine, Vice-Director of the Human Rights Monitoring Organization Asia, Jokowi’s election campaign transparency has not been lifted and development promises have not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, “There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from the endless eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and blacklisting.”
The absence of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to its neighbors near Papua.
In March, six Pacific nations (Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands) encouraged the B.M. Human Rights Council to investigate the "many and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Panaia attacks.
The same countries historically support OPM.
The Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Arrmanatha Nasir, told reporters in Jakarta, “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in force and there is free media so it’s hard to cover the evidence in human rights cases.”
The local people want more interest to the foreign government.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on May 4 under the presidency of the country’s human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, the local people, according to a source who attended the meeting and didn’t want the name to be revealed, broke their silence with their prayer “We want freedom.”
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says it is unlikely that they will vote for Jokowi again.
Chairman of the Cabal Council, Gobai, says, “Jokowi is a person with good intentions but is surrounded by people who are involved in the Paniai attack.”
Jokowi wants the people of Paniai to know that, in addition to living under the immediate threat of the exile soldier, they are rotated in the poor shore with their education and health services.
Gobai says that the Paniai people, like the other Papuains, see their votes as a "duty" they give to Jokowi to pay back their votes.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice.”
Despite the threats and fears, the families of the victims of the Paniai attack carried out a last symbolic opposition action: buriing a victim's shell in the ground right in front of the police and military station.
Knowing that justice can never be fulfilled, they will make sure at least those responsible do not forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” says Yacobus, throwing his head forward.
“What else can we do?”
The fire hit the "Meşale" cloud for the second time in Dubai.
A fire in Dubai on Friday destroyed the world’s highest housing towers and forced hundreds of residents to escape from a 79-storey building of 337 meters long.
This is the second major fire that rapidly spread to the high building called the Meşale Tower in two years.
The building was dismantled, no injuries were and no explanation was made about the cause of the large fire.
“We were sleeping and we woke up at the fire alarm, people were screaming.
“We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50th floor,” a quiet man named George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil defence authorities said firefighters had burned the large fire around 4 (00:00 GMT) in the morning by local time and they were cooling the building.
The government has announced that it is trying to provide refuge for those affected.
This event could regain questions about the safety of the materials used in the outer parts of high buildings around the world.
Research conducted by the Meşale administration after the 2015 fire found that most of the damage was in the cover, i.e. in the external panels used for decoration and isolation.
Police in the UK said they believe that the isolation and coating panel system on the Grenfell Tower in London, where 80 people were killed, could have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire there.
More than 4,000 chronic patients receive ‘social assistance’
The Ministry of Family and Social Policies will benefit from the social assistance program for the poor citizens and their families who are fighting chronic diseases, in the first stage, 4 thousand 300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients will benefit.
The Ministry, which plans to provide monthly support to patients with the aid program for more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, will also provide regular psychosocial support.
According to the information acquired, under the instructions of the Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, the details and the basis of the implementation of the "New Social Aid Programme for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases" which began work a while ago were clear.
The social aid program, launched in cooperation with the Ministry of Health with the aim of supporting citizens who are fighting chronic diseases, experiencing economic and psychological difficulties, has a characteristic of being the first in the world in many aspects.
The Ministry, completing all the preparations necessary for the launch of the program, will provide families with the social assistance program, not only cash, but also regular psychosocial support.
Thus, the aim is to ensure that poor citizens and their families who have chronic illness and continue their treatment processes in their homes are not left alone both physically and spiritually.
According to the study, in the first stage, poor citizens who are fighting Subakut Sclerosis Panensefalitis (SSPE), a brain disease caused by tuberculosis and bacterial microbes, will be given regular psychosocial and cash support under the new social assistance program.
In the advanced stages of the program, poor citizens who are fighting other rare and risky diseases will be covered by the aid program.
In addition to the support planned to be granted at a rate of more than two-thirds of the minimum wage, additional payments may be made to patients with tuberculosis identified by the relevant health unit that are unable to remove their medical self-care, continuing their lives depending on the bed or the need to improve the living conditions at home.
The minimum monthly income per person is required to be less than two-thirds of the monthly net income.
It is also necessary for citizens with SSPE disease to have a health council report arranged in accordance with the procedures and principles specified in the "Regulations on the measurement, classification and reports of the health council to be given to disabled".
According to the survey, more than one of five U.S. passengers bring forbidden goods to the aircraft.
According to a survey conducted by airline passengers, more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously stole prohibited substances from the U.S. Transport Safety Office control points, including at least 6 percent carrying prohibited knife or other sharp objects.
Less than 1 percent claimed that they later noticed that they were accidentally travelling with firearms, munitions or explosives.
A study conducted by the jet rental service Stratos Jet Charters, with more than 1,000 people, also found that younger passengers were more likely to violate the rules.
Among the participants who admitted they were intentionally trying to fly with something prohibited by TSA, 19.7 percent were members of the Y generation, but less than 15 percent were members of the X generation.
The most common substances deliberately missed from TSA agents are food and fluids.
More than 3 percent acknowledged that they consciously passed sharp security instruments, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men acknowledged that they consciously carried forbidden drugs on the plane.
The company said it surveyed passengers across the country to find out how many people mistakenly brought the airport safety and how many did it consciously.
It is not surprising that the most likely people are the most flying.
Nevertheless, as the company pointed out, the TSA rules are a piece square and confusing.
People often aren’t sure what liquids or how much of them they can carry.
So it is not surprising that the greatest amount of the substance handled by TSA appears as prohibited fluids.
For a while, people thought that TSA could be treating books as a fucking goods.
Fluids are permitted on domestic flights but are not permitted on international flights.
China welcomed US statements positively
China's Foreign Minister Vang Yi said in a press conference in Beijing, Tillerson addressed Pyongyang's administration, "We are not looking for excuses to change the regime, the collapse of the regime, the fast reunification of the peninsula and sending our soldiers to the north of the 38th parallel."
Chinese Foreign Minister Vang said Tillerson reiterated the principles of the Washington administration on the North Korean issue and hoped that the United States would implement these principles effectively and in a concrete result-oriented policy.
Considering the security of the Korean Peninsula as priorities, Vang stressed that they expect the parties to find a medium way to resolve their concerns through equal dialogue, and that the Beijing administration has long insisted on the purification of the peninsula from nuclear power, the preservation of peace and stability, and the solution of problems through dialogue and negotiations.
EPA President Pruitt Resigns to Delay Emissions Reduction Laws for Obama Period
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, Environmental Protection Organization Chairman Scott Pruitt rejected the previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama period laws that lower the emissions of air pollutants caused by dirty smoke.
Pruitt represented the change with its organization being more sensitive to the needs of state environmental regulators than past governments.
He has never mentioned a legal objection against his previous position in a federal high court.
It is concerned that the states will begin to meet the 2015 standard for ground-level ozone on 1 October, which is the end of the period.
Pruitt announced that it will delay compliance in June for a year to give its organization more time to work on the plan and to avoid "interfering with local decisions or preventing economic growth".
Before appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt, Oklahoma’s state prosecutor, has long served as a reliable ally against more strict environmental regulations.
Since Pruitt arrived in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly taken action to prevent or delay the regulations that the chemical and fossil fuel industries are opposing.
The Wednesday's sudden change is Pruitt's last legal defeat for the agenda to recall the arrangement.
Last month a federal high court in Washington ruled that the EPA manager’s attempt to delay the practice that demands oil and gas companies, a Obama administration law, to control and reduce methane leaks, is beyond the limits of their authority.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt said that the return to ozone standards boosted the EPA’s timely compliance with new standards only with the states and the commitment to work through complex processes.
Pruitt, who appealed EPA more than a dozen times in his previous work, said: “Under the previous governments, EPA often fails to meet the last dates of decisions, waiting to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, and agreed to resolve the dispute to fix the timetables for the decision.”
“We don’t believe in ordering through the proceedings and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority it has given us."
However, the EPA's statement stated that Pruitt could once again use "the delay authority and all the other authority legally available" to ensure that the regulations are supported "with sound policies and the best information available".
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader rewrite of the ozon laws.
A draft parliament, approved last month, strives to delay the implementation of the 2015 laws for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been brought to the Senate for a vote.
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the states that prosecuted the EPA this week, said the group intended to continue legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: "The EPA's change of decision after our lawsuits is a significant achievement for the health and safety of more than 115 million Americans directly affected by 6.7 million New Yorkers and their communities."
The case involved New York from California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and District of Columbia.
When general pollutants are released by cars, power plants, oil refiners, chemical facilities and other sources reacting to sunlight in the atmosphere, ozon is produced at the ground level.
The appearance of dirty smoke can lead to serious breathing problems in a rapidly affected group of people and contributes to thousands of early deaths every year.
Public health defenders and environmentalists praised Pruitt's surprising decision change.
Lori Ann Burd, from the Center for Biodiversity, said: “It’s annoying that we need so much pressure from the person responsible for preserving the atmosphere we’re treating to get this reasonable step.”
“We must continue to fight the Trump administration’s ideological struggle against environmental pollutants and interest groups.”
Inflation in a single house
In July, Turkey, which captured the largest increase in exports in 6 years, with unemployment of 13 per cent in January to 10.5 per cent in April, and the economic confidence index, which rose to the top of 3.5 years, reduced inflation to a single home.
According to data published yesterday by the Turkish Statistical Bureau (TÜIK), the Consumer Price Index (TÜFE) increased by 0.15 per cent in July, while the annual inflation increased by 9.79 per cent for the first time since January.
According to the main spending groups in July, the highest monthly increase was seen in the restaurant and hotel group with 1.75 per cent, while the highest decline was in clothing and shoes with 3.51 per cent.
The highest increase on the annual basis occurred in the transport group with 15.24 percent.
In July, Business Investment Economist Muammer Kömürcüoğlu noted that inflation, parallel to expectations, fell to a single house, "in the moderate course of inflation, the decline in food and clothing groups' prices has an impact."
But in the core indicators there is an increase compared to the previous month.
“We don’t expect the central bank to have a relief in its strict position.”
Despite the decline in inflation, the core inflation indicators have increased.
From the special comprehensive TÜFE indicators closely monitored by the Central Bank, the B index rose from 9.07 percent to 9.46 percent in July, while the C index rose from 9.20 percent to 9.60 percent.
Inver Erkan, Deputy Director of Capital FX Research, said that inflation could be closed from the level of 9.3 per cent of the year, "Inflation could swallow up to December and fall into a single house in December."
“Central Bank’s opportunity may pass in the hands by the first months of 2018,” he said.
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Şimşek: Inflation will close the end of the year with one house.
The central bank will continue to strengthen until inflation falls below 7 percent.
We will give the final form to reforms in the nearby Food Committee.
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci: We are pleased that inflation falls to one-number numbers, but it must be permanent.
In the fight against inflation, food prices should be reduced as well as supply should be increased.
Development Minister Lütfi Elvan: In the coming months, due to the basic impact, annual inflation may see some upward trend, but from the first months of 2018 inflation will decline significantly.
We expect that the annual inflation will fall to lower levels.
I wish Fenerbahce success in the next match.
Sturm Graz Technical Director Franco Foda said the performance in the second half was not enough to jump the round in the UEFA European League's 3rd front-end round with Fenerbahce in the match they stayed 1-1 against.
Speaking at a press conference held after the meeting, Foda said Fenerbahçe was a top-level team, "We couldn't use the wings in the first half."
We set the balance in the second half of the game.
We had a chance for the second goal.
I am proud of my team.
They changed the course of the game in the second half.
We could be a bit better.
Small things were decisive in the game.
“I wish Fenerbahce success in the next match,” he said.
Foda said they felt very good as long as they were in Turkey and they were happy with the hospitality they saw.
Fernando in Istanbul
The Brazilian footballer Fernando Francisco Reges, who began the transfer talks with the Galatasaray Club, arrived in Istanbul.
The Brazilian footballer arrived at Atatürk Airport, the fans welcomed with enthusiasm.
Fernando, where yellow-red fans were in love demonstrations with demonstrations, left the airport by a private car waiting for him under security measures.
The 30-year-old Fernando, who begins his career in the Brazilian Vila Nova team, dressing the forms of Estrela Amadora, Porto and Manchester City, is in the middle field.
The Brazilian footballer is expected to sign a contract with the yellow-red team after he passed the health check.
Galatasaray, who continues to transfer work, has made an agreement of 5 million 250 thousand euros with Manchester City for Fernando, who has long been trying to join his staff.
The U.S. Air Force: Internal Security Force...
Colonel Dillon, linked to the U.S. Department of Defense (Pentagon) with the video conference management from Baghdad, said that the coalition-trained "Rakka Internal Security Force" (RIGG) began to settle in areas cleaned from ISIS in the city.
Dillon said, “In the city’s cleaned areas, the Rakka Internal Security Force, consisting mainly of Arabs and local anti-ISIS volunteers, continues to maintain order and prevent terrorists from escaping or returning.”
Dillon, who said that more than 230 people completed their training this week and joined the group, said that "for now the number of forces in question is 850."
Dillon said the coalition was training the group in the fields of basic weapons training as well as first aid, armed conflict, scan and control point operations.
Dillon said that the interest in the Rakka Internal Security Force is very intense and that the coalition will continue to scan applicants for training and employment.
The U.S.-led coalition is cooperating with the Syrian Democratic Forces, which is the main spine of the PYD/PKK in the assembly of Rakka.
The PYD/PKK terrorist organization has appointed a PKK terrorist named Leyla Mohammed to the wife chairman of the Rakka civil administration council.
It is said that there will be members of the PKK/PYD in the military force in Rakka.
Dillon also announced that the U.S.-led coalition had cut its support last week, collecting heavy weapons from the opposition group Shuhuda Karyateyn (Shuhuk) in the southern Al-Tanif camp in Syria.
Dillon said, “After talks with the leaders last week, Shuhuk returned the heavy weapons and equipment the coalition gave them but some small weapons and light vehicles were allowed to stay in them.”
The U.S. said last week that it has withdrawn its support from Shuhuk because it has gone out of the non-conflict areas they agreed with Russia and is in activities that are not related to the fight against ISIS.
The group said he wanted to fight against the Bashar al-Assad regime as well.
According to the telephone call notes, Trump pressed Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The notes of the telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were scattered by the Washington Post.
In a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on January 27, Trump pressed him not to say publicly he will not pay for the proposed border wall.
The U.S. President scratched the Mexican President who kept the ball openly on the wall and said the rumor "You can't tell the press this."
Trump started his presidential campaign on building a wall along the U.S. southern border and promised to pay for the project to Mexico.
The first meeting with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was announced.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that the agreement on the U.S. receipt of refugees to Australia is "mascaric", "destroyed" and "aptal" and that the agreement under Obama's administration will show himself as a "blind" after it proposed to the U.S. the ban on a refugee placement.
Mr. Trump ended his speech to Mr. Turnbull, saying, “This was the worst speech I’ve done all day.”
The patient broke the doctor's nose.
The doctors and staff of the Turkish Higher Education and Research Hospital left short-term work last morning in order to respond to a doctor's friend's conviction by the patient's relatives.
The crowd gathered in front of the main entrance of the hospital with the "No to violence in health" in their hands reacted to the incident.
Professor Dr. Feyza Ayşenur Paç, Chief Clinical of Children’s Cardiology at the Hospital, says, “No to violence in health” slogan seems to me insufficient even as a side slogan.”
There is no place for violence in health.
“If this way goes, this people will not be able to find a health group to serve themselves soon.”
To the action of health workers, Ankara Provincial Health Director Dr. Kamil Türkmen, Ankara First District Public Hospitals Secretary General Prof. Dr. Öner Odabaş, Turkey Higher Education and Research Hospital Headquarters Prof. Dr. Mustafa Paç and the patient neighbors in the hospital garden also supported.
He who denounced the incident said:
Violence against health workers is increasing.
We have seen an example of this incident yesterday (the previous day) evening, with our cardiovascular surgeon being hit by a patient nearby.
Although we take the measures we can as our state, ministry and governorate to make these events end immediately, we demand that our people be more sensitive to this issue.
I denounce the events of yesterday on behalf of my hospital and medical staff.
On the other hand, it is important to note that the public should be aware of violence in health, saying, “Unfortunately, this time we have lived, it has become a professional complication.”
“We’re going to take our own measures, but the most important thing is that our people have their own healthcare workers.”
Turkmen said that the trial in connection with the incident began, "Our laws on violence in health have been sufficiently effective."
The government is implementing this.
Security is currently working.
In the past, these were always empty, but now it is a direct public case and the state is appointing a lawyer, pursuing the case.
“There are examples of severe punishments on the subject,” he said.
After the explanations, the workers continued their work.
According to the report, the incident occurred at 17.45 a.m. the previous day.
The victims of the patient who lost his life in intensive care attacked Dr. Hamdi Mehmet Özbek, who worked in the Heart and Arterial Surgery department, giving death news.
Uzbek was removed from the scene by doctors and assistants; police were called to the hospital.
During the incident, Uzbek's nose was broken, the attackers were arrested.
One of the witnesses said:
When our friend went to the victims of the patient to report the condition of a patient who lost his life, the victims of the patient took our friend and us responsible for the situation and attacked our two friends.
My friend’s nose was broken, and he was in the blood.
Then I took my friend to the hospital and hid him.
The security set was trapped between us for 15-20 minutes.
If the sick neighbors had crossed that security wall, things would have been much worse.
A heavy blow to ISIS in Gaziantep: 102 pockets...

The suspects were arrested by the police officer who was sentenced.
The YPG in Syria.
The US interfered.
According to information obtained by AA from local sources, YPG terrorists, under U.S. military support, stolen the houses of residents of Tel Semin district in the northern rural area of Rakka, where the terrorist organization enters for the reason of fighting with ISIS.
The reaction of the civilians who stolen and handled their homes turned into a conflict with the terrorist organization.
After that, the U.S. forces in the area entered the town with armed vehicles.
"Cougar MRAP" type weapons, personnel carriers and Husky type mining vehicles were found to form a tampon area in the field.
The terrorist organization YPG does not allow civilians who flew from death in Rakka, which was shot under the anti-ISIS operation, to enter the cities under its control.
The local activist network called "Rakka is quietly killing" announced yesterday that only in July 121 civilians were killed in the group's gunfire.
Let us not move the struggles of the old world to tomorrow.
The delayed perception of domestic and world facts can lead to the crisis of not just people, but countries.
One of the reasons why the retarded East, which we call the form of "sensitivity", is delayed perception of world facts, may be that the reflection of these facts into the geographics of the East may be blocked by specific focuses or disclosed in an over-real way.
Don Kishot and Oblomov have been the subject of the world of literature to perceive or not perceive the facts and changes.
Cervantes’s “Don Quixote” is a must that still considers himself a rider when the bourgeoisie begins to form.
Or Gonçarov's "Oblomov" is a thin inheritance that believes that when he ignores the facts, everything can go as it was before.
For example, China was a land open to the world until the end of the 15th century and dominated by the seas, while a holding family was closed into it as a result of the passage of a tree.
This was until the execution of the captains of boats out of China's black waters.
If one foot, eye and ears are in the West, the other foot, eye and ears are in the East, we Turkish people have experienced constant doubts about the perception of the facts and the change, starting with the Ottoman.
We tried to move the past and the new part to today, to understand the present with the concepts that conform to the old conditions, to think the tomorrow.
One part of us was able to behave as fast as the focus of thought in developed countries in the perception of domestic and world facts, as well as change.
This has led to constant conflicts and tensions.
The university with Medrese, the modern army with its novices, the encounters of belief and doubts, caused a dramatic dualism.
Further worse, it is not accepted that the new and advanced positions in a period of time, at the end of a certain period of time, will be old and will remain behind.
The progressors of yesterday after a period of time began to declare the new and advanced "Dangerous", while those trying to interpret the country and world conditions in a manner consistent with the current reality began to declare "Hain".
The most important lesson in Ottoman was that those who delayed perception of the country and world facts, and in the end they dominated the thought and state life, the empire broke out, collapsed, and the people became poor.
The most important lesson our Ottoman past transmitted to the Republic was the fact that the rapid perception of the world’s conjoncture and change was an inevitable prerequisite for standing.
Because this lesson was very well absorbed, we could be the example country of this geography that has managed to preserve its unity, integrity and stability in peace from the First World War until now.
In a different approach, in order to be able to overcome the process of global change right and peacefully, we need to leave the memories behind and behave in accordance with the facts.
In other words, it will not be good for anyone to move the meaningless campings and blood cases that have led to the collapse of our democracy in the past to this day.
Moreover, the smallest mistakes in today’s world lead to great and dramatic crises.
The most problematic geography in this regard is the Middle East where we are.

The wind of Turkey
The global giants, who trust the future of Turkey, fought the breakthrough in the wind power plant tender that took place yesterday.
The global record was broken in the tender on the model that the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources established to ensure the transition to national energy by reducing external dependence.
With the tender to lower the energy costs of Turkey, $1 billion investment and 4 thousand jobs have also opened the way.
By the beginning of 2019, domestic production wind turbines will be included in the system.
Opened by the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, renewable resource areas (YEKA) wind power plant license tender included 8 consortiums, including U.S., Chinese, German and Danish giants.
In the tender, the financial offer cover was opened in order to identify the 5 tenderers who first gave the lowest offer.
After the first offer cover, the lowest offer was $4.19 per kilowatt hour.
The open scale was determined at 0.01 cents.
After the tender began, the joint entrepreneurial groups, which included Enercon, Gold Wind, GE, Senvion and Vestas, decided to participate in the open deal.
In the open defeat, Siemens, Nordex and Mingyang competed.
After the withdrawal of the consortium with Nordex, MingYang-First Construction and Siemens-Turkers-Callion remained the last two.
MingYang-First Construction took a break 11 times.
The Siemens-Turker-Kalyon Energy consortium has never taken a break.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak: Record Day for Turkey.
The 30th round continued.
The winner of the intense dispute between the two consortiums was the Siemens-Turkers-Kalyon joint venture group, which offered the lowest offer with $3.48 cent/kilowat hour.
The consortium gave an offer of $3.49 cent/kilowat hour in the tender, while the assistant deputy Alparslan Bayraktar's proposal was drawn to $3.48, on the request of the tender committee.
During the two-hour tender, Turkey won a world record.
$3.48/cent per kilowatt hour offered in the tender was the lowest figure in the world in this area.
The previous record was $3.84 per kilowatt hour.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who held a press conference after the announcement, said that the victory of the competition was an important message to the region and the world, “When we look at the 200-year historic cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make a significant contribution to the relations between Turkey and Germany.”
Our goals are big.
Today’s outcome has shown how solid and secure the economy and energy markets are going towards the future.
No matter how many regional crises there are in the world, I’m very proud to show that Turkey is in the top of the region and the world’s most reliable investmentable countries.
"All Turkey, in this picture we will be proud of as 80 million, the greatest contribution, within 15 years of power and leadership, belongs to our President who takes Turkey to this point."
Albayrak, who expressed that they have launched a new period with an open, transparent and competitive tender, said: "One of the most important steps of this was that the purchase cost of $10.3 per kilowatt hour with the domestic contribution to the wind until the day, with a historic record falling $3.48 per cent, with a world record price."
I am proud of this, in my name, in my country.
Minister Albayrak said they intend to activate the first domestic production panels in solar energy before the end of 2018, "I hope we will include our domestic production wind turbines in the system until the beginning of 2019."
Turbines will be established in the 5 specified areas.
The winner of the competition will receive a total of a thousand megawatts of installing power in each of these 5 regions, with the requirement to install at least 50 megawatts of wind power.
The total investment of Siemens-Turks-Kalyon Group will exceed $1 billion.
With the entry into operation of local wind power plants, at least 3 billion kilowatt hours of electricity will be produced each year and about 1.1 million households’ annual electricity needs will be met by wind.
With the wind facilities to be built, an average of 1.5 million tons of CO2 emissions per year will be reduced.
The winner of the competition will set up a factory with more than $100 million investment.
The plant will produce an average of 300 to 450 indigenous wind turbines with a power of at least 2.3 megawatts.
The consortium, wings, generator design, material technology and production techniques, software and innovative dental box fields will carry out R&D work for at least three in a total of 5 fields for 10 years.
A budget of $5 million is allocated annually for R&D work, while 80 percent of local engineers will work with 50 technical staff.
The factory will be established 21 months after the contract was signed.
The duration of the project is 30 years.
Kazim Turker, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Turkers Construction, which is part of the tender winning consortium, said that the project will be around 64 per cent of domestic production, 35 per cent of the equipment will come from abroad, "We plan to provide the financing of the equipment from foreign sources and the rest from the domestic banks."
Turker said the deal reflects confidence in the Turkish economy.
Kalyon Holding Energy Group Chairman Murtaza Ata said, “It was an offer to reduce Turkey’s external dependence by a thousand megawatts.”
“We are happy with the outcome.”
SIemens Gamesa Turkish Chief Executive Hakan Yıldırım also stated that they have been operating in Turkey for 160 years, "We will do our best to reduce the cost of the electric unit further."
The domesticity rate of wind turbines to be produced in the factory will be at least 65%.
65 percent of the 8,000 industrial pieces in the wind turbine will be domestic (at least 5,200 pieces).
In each of the 5 regions, at least 50 MW, a total of 1000 MW facility will be established.
3,750 employment opportunities 10 years R&D obligation $5 million to R&D activities each year
1000MW Wind Factory 65% Locality Rate Production of 300 to 450 indigenous wind turbines with a power of at least 2.3 MWe.
More than $1 billion investment Annual 400 MW/year wind turbine production capacity over $100 million factory investment.
Electricity production will meet the needs of approximately 1.1 million houses Annual minimum 3 billion kWh of electricity production Average 1.5 million tons of CO2/year emissions reduction.
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Revealed the Racial Linch Event to Call for Justice
A 1948 model Ford Mercury was passed through a group of spectators in the Monroe Georgia countryside and advanced toward the small Ford Bridge in Moore.
The car, with four black passengers and a white driver, came forward to closing the road by a group of armed white men before they reached the bridge.
A middle-aged, thin-line clothed man, the leader of the gang took a long breath from the puros and looked carefully from the front window to the inside.
Those who were inside were scared.
“That’s what we want, Roger!” he said.
“Go out of the car!”
A young black man was pulled out of the front passenger seat and the screams were going through the dark.
Fortunately, this horrible scene played on June 22 is just a reanimation.
But when a scientist was thrown around the "Roger" neck, almost everyone of the spectators breathed quite realisticly.
Since 2005, human rights defenders have returned to the Ford Bridge in Moore to revive the two black couples (Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey) who were linked by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
So far, no one has been accused of murder.
Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the reorganization, said: "While we see them in our societies, we know who they are, it doesn't make sense that a single person has not been arrested for all these years."
“This is a spot in history, but a burden in our souls.”
Brooks, 71, was a former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong human rights advocate.
For her, this resurrection is a call for dramatic action and a yearly reminder to Monroe society that an injustice has never been corrected.
He said, “We want the prosecution, we want the result, we want the wounds to be hugged, we want the reconciliation, but first we have to justice.”
“We can’t have justice until the wounds are embraced and reconciliated.”
On July 27, 1946, a court officer placed a shirt on the body of one of the victims of the Ford line in Moore.
According to the NBC News FBI files, Monroe and more than 50 men from the surrounding areas have been suspected of linking.
But one of them has never been investigated.
Though suspects have remained as refugees for decades, human rights defenders say the twins’ motivations are always well known everywhere in the city: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a high court ruling allowed black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time at the end of that summer.
According to the FBI, almost at the same time as the election, the black partner Roger Malcom, a white land owner, Barnett Hester, appeared to be associated with a woman during a fight.
Brooks said the rumor in the city was that Hester was sleeping with Malcom's wife Dorothy and the baby he carried was not his own husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a leading white land owner, paid $600 to bring Malcom out of prison.
Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey went to prison.
But when they arrived at the Ford Bridge in Moore, a band of lens surrounded the car.
A FBI report concludes, “It seems that Harrison was the one who arranged the murders and ordered them.”
“It is also clear that there has been a secret agreement between the state and local lawmakers that they have not only participated in the murder, they have destroyed evidence and hidden the identities of witnesses.”
Brooks spoke short and more.
He said, “This was a massacre of the right to vote.”
"Everyone was killed to send a message to the black people in this society: 'If you register and vote, that's what you'll do.'"
For a decade, Cassandra Greene has managed the reanimation of the Ford Bridge lenses in Moore, which takes place every year.
Its performance takes into account all the details, it is remarkable and is based on a profound kind of racism that many believe it no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to observe and even harder to turn his eyes, but Greene says that’s the purpose.
He said, “We don’t want to talk about Lynch because it faces all of us with the ugliness within us.”
“But if you don’t listen to me or don’t listen to what’s happening to me, I can’t develop a relationship with you.”
The tests of this year's production began in June and the first day, about 30 actors (a dozen white and the rest black) were filled in a room, and when Greene enters the well-tested general lines of the game, they listened.
Wade Marbaugh is the assistant director of Greene.
President Klansman has played the role for years, but he says the role has never been easy.
Marbaugh said, “I feel angry because that’s not me.”
“But I think it’s very important to keep this past alive because we don’t want to return to that time.”
Thro the room, the actors playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona tried their own lines.
The game begins with Malcom screaming and pushing her to Hester, where he was very angry because he was sleeping with his wife Dorothy.
“I said, ‘Go out of my property!’
Rascone is reacting.
There is a shooting sound.
And then everyone (at least the black actors) is drowned in laughter.
Greene laughs most.
Rascona asked “What?”
He was disappointed, surprised.
I was too hard?
Greene said “No” in the screams.
“I don’t think that the white people just said that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say that the white people would say.”
One of the black actors threw a stone mixed with a joke saying “Yes.”
“You have to push R.”
So the energy in the room is changing and some kind of intimacy is replaced by discomfort.
Everyone is dedicated to doing this right, not only for the memory of the game but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time he says the word starting with Rascona N, sharp and emphasized.
Surely no one laughs.
The resuscitation ends strongly and quickly.
There are screams, fire and then silence.
A woman dressed in the funeral black stands on the bodies of the actors and reads Billie Holiday's sad text "Strange Fruit".
In one of the two words the voice is broken.
A group of average four-thousand viewers remove their tears and tears from their eyes.
The spectator is almost equally divided into black and white.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to see their performance, many of them from the way forward.
While Brooks took them on a sacred journey to the Malcoms and Dorsey's tombs, they all stood on the oppressive moisture of Georgia for almost eight hours.
To this point the murders remained an anecdote, but now standing in the same place where the linen is, means the weather seems as a curse.
While the last notes of the song weaken, Greene invites the crowd to approach and study the bodies.
Children throw on their hands, throw false blood and unmoving bodies and throw to each other.
A little child is as if he reminds himself, “They’re not really dead.”
After a few minutes, Greene thanked the crowd and suddenly ended.
The actors throw the linch thread and remove their tears.
Bradshaw is hugging the team dressed Marbaugh who plays President Klansman.
Nick Rascona is hugged with two of his acting friends, and the age is empty from their eyes in their arms, and the emotional price of the performance ultimately comes to him.
One of the women shouted, “It’s not a problem.”
“We know that’s not what’s in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Then the spectators are sitting for dinner with the actors.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta is thrilledly talking about reanimation with a black couple.
Denise Duplinski is hard to find words about how the performance makes her feel.
He said, “These terrible and horrible words and behaviors come from people who are like you and do so because they are like you.”
“It’s what it does to me that it suggests that the lines are still on,” he added, “they are now just being tried by police armed attacks.”
At the end of the room, Tyrone Brooks is focusing on eating at the table and speaking about human rights memories.
He said he has already started planning for the next year.
He said, “Renaissance is inspiring in a way because it describes what we’ve suffered but also teaching.”
“As if you don’t learn from it, it might be again.
Those who do not investigate their past, and those who do not know their past, are condemned to repeat it.”

The website "akkongreler.com" was established for the ordinary Congress process.
The website contains brochures, materials and images that the party agency will use in this process.
In the 'Communication Strategy' section of the site, the rules to be followed during the congress process were ranked in 14 headlines.

In order to restore the business, Pearson made another 3,000 dismissals, cut the profit share
The British training group Pearson said it would make more than 3,000 jobs off on Friday, while starting another restructuring program to overcome the pressure that the company faced, and reducing its intermediate profit share by 72 percent.
According to chief executive John Fallon, largely the dismissals that will be at the end of 2018 and early 2019 will add to the 4000 positions lost in the previous rebuilding.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to save 300 million pounds (394 million U.S. dollars) more by trying to reboot the rapidly shifting business to digital learning with a third cost reduction program.
The company, which agreed to sell its share in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann last month, said there was no change in the perspective of this year after it its basic sales increased by 1 percent in the first half for £2.05 billion.
The 2s brought to death again.
According to the first report of the Judicial Medical Institute, according to the first findings in Hakan’s preliminary autopsy report, death is suicide.
In the detailed examination, no traces and traces were found on the child's body.
The cause of suicide is the fatigue of the elastic bandage on the neck.
It was also identified that the gland, which his family indicated as the gland, was an elastic bond used in wounds.
According to the news of Muslim Sarıyar, after the preparation of the detailed report on the death of the child, the report indicating the incident is suicide will be sent to the Grandçekmece Republic Prosecutor's Office, which is conducting the investigation.
While the police are investigating the child's suicide with all the details, the investigations on the computer captured after the incident are ongoing.
The police said they would also request the statement of Hakan's friends.
It is also stated that the information obtained from the computer of Hakan, whose relatives call "clean", can be accessed to third parties or a gang.
Police estimate Hakan could have been driven by a suicide gang.
The gain of certainty that Hakan committed suicide turned his eyes to Text2 that contains violence.
Reacting for the reason that it caused addiction and violence in children, last year by the Antalya Governorate forbidden to children under the age of 15 in Metin2, 2009" again came to the agenda with the murder of the 13 year old "minic hacker" Metin Kang.
In 2005 you need to enter the site and register to play "Text2" designed in Korea.
Players are trying to ensure peace and justice in the world with the god of the dragon in the game.
While doing this, there are wars, the dose of violence increases.
In the game, there are also images of the struggle with frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs, frogs.
The player purchases characters with money to become stronger.
After the incident occurred on July 25 in the house of Esenyurt İstiklal Mahallesi Köknar Street, the family that gave their children to the ground the next day continued the claim of murder.
Father Mehmet Ekinci said, "All the dream was to be a doctor, we don't think he could hurt himself or someone else because of the game," he said, "They wrapped the elastic shell on their neck and threw the node on the side."
This is how I found my son.
We definitely don’t think that our son can hurt him or someone else because of a game on the internet.
I knew he was playing such a game.
It was not a fun game.
Let’s say that when you get bored, you’ll get out of the game.
The mother smiled and said, “There is no entrance to the building.”
It is said that in a certain hour my child entered the house.
None of them hold each other.
When my brother came home, he had a single chair.
“But when the funeral was found, there were two seats next to the computer,” he said.
Previous Previous post: It may be infected
Parents generally don’t pay attention to this.
“My child is at home, whatever happens.”
The child communicates with many people through games.
There may be a situation of borrowing, or curse.
Or you have invited a person in the game home, there may be a problem between them.
It may have been influenced by the problems he has experienced, not directly from the game, but by the other people he communicates through the game.
The visuality of the game, the fiction of the child may have been thought real.
Suicide trauma may be related to fraud.
If the child is faced with a situation of complaint to the family, there is also a situation of disorder because he can’t solve this problem.
He could not commit suicide because of the game.
It is also possible for the child to be infected.
It may be infected.
Personally, there is nothing that the child can do alone.
Information Systems Advisor Füsun NEBIL: Parents should know how their children interact
We can’t say the games are harmful.
Research also suggests that games are useful for the development of children.
It’s important here that parents pay attention to what their children play and how they talk to players online.
Parents should know and take care of what content children are affected.
In the last five years there are only two children in Turkey who have died due to gambling.
This also shows that the end of a child’s life is not just the impact of games.
What did this child do?
We need to learn this first.
It is necessary to look at sociology and psychology around the child.
The eight-month return on the stock market in Istanbul stands at 50 percent.
The BIST 100 index continued the rise trend that it started in December 2016 in July and moved its rise to the top of the 8th month.
Thus, for the first time since July 2007, the index recorded an increase over eight months in a row, winning 45.3 per cent in this period.
With its performance since the beginning of the year, the BIST 100 index, which has left behind the world’s main stock exchanges, including Germany, the United States, the UK, and Japan, has not left the lead in the return base in July.
The BIST 100 index, which completed a 7.06 percent rise in July, followed the Dow Jones index in the U.S. with a 2.54 percent rise and the FTSE 100 index in the UK with a 0.81 percent rise.
In Almaya, the DAX index and in Japan, the Nikkei index completed July with a loss of value.
From January to July, the BIST 100 index showed high performance from both the main world exchanges and the emerging country exchanges.
This year, the BIST 100 index, which gained a value of 37.6 per cent compared to the 2016 closure, followed the Dow Jones index with an increase of 10.76 per cent, the DAX index with an increase of 5.5 per cent, the Nikkei index with an increase of 4.5 per cent, and the FTSE 100 index with an increase of 3.21 per cent.
The MSCI EM index, which is an indicator for developing countries’ exchanges, has achieved a 23 percent return.
When we look at the historical process, the BIST 100 index has shown similar performance in the past.
The last BIST 100 index, which was completed by earning value for 8 months in a row between December 2006 and July 2007, recorded an increase of 38.3 per cent during this period.
In addition, the BIST 100 index was completed by achieving upper value in the 8 months between August 1996 and March 1997 and in the 9 months in a row between May 1997 and January 1998.
MEKSA Investment Research Director Eren Can Umüt said in a statement to AA reporter that the BIST 100 index has continued to rise for 8 months, noting that since the beginning of the year the rise has exceeded the level of 37 percent.
The MSCI noted that the index of developing markets (EM) increased by 23 per cent, noting that there is a positive division even when we look at these rates:
The flow of funds to developing countries has been ongoing since the beginning of the year.
Particularly high-rise funds prefer countries with higher interest rates.
In this case, domestic markets are positively affected.
Of course, the appetite to take risks on a global scale is too high.
In this way, the stock index in the risk asset status is regarded.
In the U.S. we see new record levels being tested almost every week, parallel to 11 percent growth since S&P 500’s Christmas.
At the beginning of the year, the U.S. Central Bank (Fed) has estimated that the 3th interest rate rise stresses the markets but stresses that the Fed has eliminated uncertainty by using its oral policy very well, noting that the Fed has a market that is sensitive to the interest rate rise.
The U.S. has said that inflation is not yet at the desired level, that the Fed’s expectations will not take a hurry on the rise of interest and avoid radical movements are also very effective in current pricing.
The U.S. President Donald Trump's failure to cancel the health reform known as "Obamacare" has strengthened the perception that expanding financial policies will not be able to fulfill their promises, "While thanks to Trump the faster-growing U.S. economy expectations have a positive impact on the stock markets for a period, the failure to fulfill the promises strengthens the hand of the Fed and the market in this context in terms of response to faster growth and faster inflation."
According to the Turkish markets, taking into account that 2016 was a year in which many disadvantages occurred, the negative dividing and over-selling BIST 100 index is in an effort to close the difference between the same.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania.
The committee stated that it has tracked some profit sales in the BIST 100 index, which technically tested new records with 108,600 levels, noting the following:
In particular, the area of 109.500-110.000 is a short-term critical edge.
After approaching these levels, profit sales are normal.
We think that a new local or global story should be formed for over 110,000 prices in the short term.
So far, moving down the support of 107.500 could trigger profit sales.
In this case, if we follow the 107,000 intermediate support, I think we can see relaxation up to the 106,000-105,500 area.
In particular, the breakdown of the support of 105,500 could lead to the withdrawal to the level of 104,300, which is equivalent to 50 percent of the Fibo rise from 100,000 to the level of 108,600.
The Commission said that both the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) decisions will be at the center of the global market, the expectations for the Fed are already clear, but it is not expected to increase the interest rate in the FOMC in September that the likelihood of the budget reduction program to enter into force may trigger strengthening in the U.S. dollar.
The IMEI said that this situation could trigger profit sales in the developing country’s (GOU) stock index, which is in the shadow of excess purchases in the short term, “But the most important thing is what the ECB will say.”
After the European Monetary Policy Council meeting in July, ECB President Mario Draghi said he would discuss the currency policy course in the autumn and this statement led to the rise of the euro/dollar parity above the 1,1700 levels.
Therefore, the announcement that the 60 billion euro monthly asset acquisition program will be reduced or could be terminated will mean that the global post-Fed liquidity will also be reduced by the ECB.
"Therefore, negative prices in the name of the markets of the country, which provide high currency open and the access to the external funds is mandatory, such as Turkey, can occur," he said.
Gedik Investment Investment Advisory Director Erol Gürcan also said in November 2016, after Trump's presidential election in the U.S. there was a very serious rally in terms of global stock markets.
Gürcan noted that the key element that triggered this rally movement is possible to say that there are developments that increase global growth expectations, including Trump’s promises for tax reduction:
The Stock Exchange of Istanbul also ranked in the top of the world’s leading rally.
Although one of the most important reasons for this is that the BIST 100 index has remained quite stable compared to similar developing markets in recent years, it is useful to say that the steps taken by policy makers towards supporting the economy and the financial markets have also played a serious role.
In particular, we can say that the Credit Guarantee Fund (KGF), which has become active since March, has a serious impact on the index that has been observed so far.
During the rest of the year, the positive developments significantly reflected in prices and the KGF, which has a significant role in this rise, has gradually reached satisfaction, the BIST 100 index still remains stable compared to the similar country markets, but the search for a new story for the rest of the year can also gradually come to the forefront.
Gürcan noted that the 180-day action plan, which is expected to share the details for a long time, can be a positive contribution in this sense, such as the increase in the limit of the Credit Guarantee Fund, the implementation of regulations in the direction of supporting the company’s profits, the developments such as the possible tax reduction that has been scheduled in the recent period.
The major developed country central banks, such as Gürcan, the Fed, the ECB and the British Central Bank (BoE), will also slowly strengthen their current expanding monetary policy positions and are among the critical risk elements for developing countries, highlighting that "the Fed, which has long continued measurable interest rates increases, is very likely to start the balance sheet reduction process after September, the ECB's possibility of terminating the asset acquisition program in the near future and the possibility that the BOE will be a major developed country central bank that will increase interest rates after the Fed will be the main developments that must be followed in this sense."
Gürcan said that in the possible correction movements in the index in the next period, the 104.150-104.600 support area, which corresponds to the 200-hour moving average with the rise trend seen since the beginning of the year, is quite critical, the correction movement could continue to the level of 101.700, 100,000, 99.200 respectively in the event of the breakdown of this support area.
Gürcan said if the current rise trend isined and the 108.605 resistance, which is the current historical peak level, is broken, the index could rise to the range of 110.000-112.000.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Military Suicide Attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber in the Afghan capital Kabul attacked a military convoy, killed a NATO soldier and wounded several.
NATO said five soldiers and one translator were injured.
Uncertain local sources say three civilians were killed in the incident in the city’s Karabakh region.
The bombing was the last violence in Afghanistan this month; more than 30 people were killed on Tuesday in a mosque explosion in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
In a NATO statement, the explosion on Thursday evening was to have been attacked by a "personal-driven hand-made explosive" in a joint shipping mission with the Afghan army.
The statement said all the injured were in good condition and were treated at the U.S. military hospital in Bagram air base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh are an important source of concern for NATO forces that are spoken near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, in the first half of 2017, Afghanistan witnessed the deaths of at least 1662 civilians, including an average of 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb car killed at least 30 people in the mainly Shiite area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they did the attack.
On 31 May, after the U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001, a massive bombing in the city center killed more than 150 people in the country's deadliest militant attack.
The violent act emphasizes the unstable security situation in Afghanistan while puts the weight of U.S. President Donald Trump on increasing the number of U.S. troops helping the army and police in the country.
Reporters say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have led to a crisis in the government’s policies and public confidence, especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA stopped delaying the dirty air rule after the cases
The U.S. Environmental Protection Organization has returned from the decision to delay the law, a Obama transfer law, which demands that the states prevent the emissions that cause dirty smoke, a day later, with a 15 state organization appealing on this attempt.
The EPA announced on Wednesday that it will continue with "Ozone Decisions 2015" by showing the organization's determination to work with the states late.
EPA Chairman Scott Pruitt said in a statement, "We believe in dialogue with our state partners and being sensitive to them."
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the EPA to postpone ozone decisions for a year until October 2018, with these decisions measuring current dirty smoke pollution in various parts of the country and determining where it is mandatory to be interrupted to meet more challenging air quality standards.
The majority of the Democratic 15 states and the Columbia District on Tuesday opened a lawsuit saying that the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration continues to seek to recover the wide range of environmental regulations implemented by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda that Trump calls to revive economic growth.
But these efforts led to the reaction of Democrats and protective groups concerned about the effects of more emissions on public health.
The EPA’s website says that ozon-containing air breathing “can reduce lung functions and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.”
The forest gave the blessing.
Stop and transfer of wings.
The head of Beşiktaş Fikret Orman, the Dutch footballer Jeremain Lens and Bein Sports have made a statement about the transfer.
The forest says that...
There is no surprise at transfer.
Our goal is not a lot of transfer, but a point shooting.
Now we will make a stopper and wing transfer.
We have a championship and we hope we have a good match.
We have to do the obligatory wing transfer.
$10 million is easy, but we have no budget.
If it comes to the budgets we call, we will transfer, and if we don’t, we will not die.
I can’t tell you about Lens.
We are a public company.
The end of patience is greeting.
Is there a threat for the 30th of August, not for the festival?
The Ankara Governorate, due to the "ISIS threat", continues to react to the prohibition of seating, memorial meetings and all collective events, including concerts during the month of August.
The ruling prohibition of the Governorate contains the expression "all collective events" while in Ankara 7.
The International Grand Ankara Festival continues.
CHP Group President and Ankara Parliamentary Deputy Levent Gök said in a statement to SÖZCÜ "30 August can not even be affected by the ban" and said:
He has a serious confusion.
He even hesitated on what decision he would make.
The duty of the state is to create places where the holidays will be celebrated.
CHP Ankara MP Murat Emir also said "All Ankara has a security problem, only Gökçek's organizations have no security problem."
An independent parliamentary representative of Ankara, Aylin Nazlıaka, brought the ban to the parliament.
Nazlıaka, who asked for the prime minister's response, said, "Is this ban not clearly showing the republic and Atatürk's hostility? how do you think to prevent the millions who will celebrate the 30th of August in the fields?"
“I learned from Edwin that I was deceived.”
The divorce case with Ibrahim Kutluay continued with Demet Shener, the previous day his lawyer was in the Nishantaşı.
Shener, who opened a spiritual compensation case against Edwina Sponza, who claimed he had destroyed his house, presented the photos taken together with Sponza and Kutluay as evidence to the court.
Social Beauty Sponza was also charged with Shener, saying, "Demet illegally captured my private photographs."
“I did not eat.”
After this recent development, Shener, who met with his lawyer at Nişantaşı Delicatessen, saw the journalists and went out of the site.
Shener, who was very happy, was laughing when he was reminded of Edwina Sponza’s claims about the photos, saying, “God, I’ve probably entered your house and got it.”
The real Hatemi is about Sponza's complaint "There's such a complaint but the content is not true."
“We have everything in our hands, we have brought it to the court.”
Shener told reporters, “In the past, everyone knew your wife’s relationship with Sponza.”
“How did you not know?” he was very surprised.
What to?
How to?
“I swear I didn’t know,” Shener said, “will I believe my husband who looked in my eyes, or the rumor of me?”
When the journalists insisted on asking "Do you have never heard anything?" Shener said "No," he continued, "I have not heard, of course I heard it for the first time."
I did not believe in anything like that.
Everything was normal, it was in place; there was nothing to doubt.
When I sent it all in my hand, I learned it all new.
Shener, who answered “Yes” to the question “Is the person who sent the evidence Sponza?” confused his heads by claiming that his photos and letters were sent to the court by Sponza himself.
Sponza had previously claimed that their contacts with Ibrahim Kutluay were assembled.
He will sign a contract with Negredo tomorrow.
The club will officially include the Spanish footballer Alvaro Negredo tomorrow.
The signature ceremony will be held at Vodafone Park for Negredo, where Beşiktaş agreed in principle on transfer with Spain's Valencia Club.
The signature ceremony that will be attended by the club's President Fikret Forest will be held at 12 p.m.
The Spanish footballer will take a health check tomorrow morning.
Qatar: We broke the embargo in hours thanks to Turkey
Qatar Economy and Trade Minister Ahmed Bin Jassim Al Thani said he wanted to express his gratitude to the Turkish people.
Al Thani: "I am grateful for your honourful attitude and support you have given us."
I also send congratulations from the Qatar Emirate to my brother President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Qatar economy has demonstrated its resistance.
In many countries, our economies are still stable while our economies are under negative impact.
We must work with our strength to make Qatar independent and strong.
We broke the embargo against us in hours thanks to Turkey greatly.
We don’t miss anything at the moment.
Our natural resources, natural gas exports provide great support to the economy of Qatar.
We were not affected by the abstinence against the laws and violations against us, thanks to Turkey.
Today, Qatar is continuing its global production of natural gas and LNG.
“There’s not a decline in our natural gas exports, but a 30 percent increase.”
Al Thani said that the work on the brotherhood relations between Qatar and Turkey and all areas continued, "the volume of trade between us was $554 million in the first quarter."
The decisions taken in recent years have played an important role.
As a result of the proof of Turkish products in the Qatar market, accelerating the entry of goods from Turkey in all sectors, making investments in many areas is extremely important for us.
“I thank you very much for your constructive attitude towards us.”
The cost of the last disaster is 300 million TL.
TSB Chairman Can Akın Çağlar noted that after the flood pressure on July 18 the insurance companies were 116 million TL 7 thousand damages, the Gökova earthquake on July 21 received 12 million Lira 800 damages, and on July 27 the flood in Istanbul and filled 168 million Lira 22 thousand damages, noting that the last three events found the insurance cost of 300 million Lira.
Age, "The damage caused by the full in terms of Kasko insurance is approximately 3 thousand 500 pounds per car and glass damage is approximately a thousand pounds."
“In the event of the earthquake, the average housing damage is £6,000,” he said.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania and the Republic of Lithuania, “three of every four people have no housing insurance, one of every two has no fire insurance and two of every three people have no casco insurance, and the risk of natural disasters is increasing due to climate change.”
Due to the low insurance rate in our country, the risk of facing serious damage costs to our citizens and institutions increases every day.
All of these costs should not be left on the state.
Insurance policies are not as expensive as they think, and insurance is not just a damage-paying sector; it also provides risk management consultancy.
Increasing insurance awareness and insurance rates are very important for our people and our country.
Can Akın Çağlar says, "In the general conditions of Kasko insurance, the insurers must report their damages within 5 working days and this period ended yesterday."
"Will the insured be a victim?" he answered the question: "While in general such a period in the Trade Act, the time exceeding period is 2 years."
“And these events are natural disasters, so the insurers don’t have to panic, no company says I don’t pay.”
This is how the German media saw the big deal!
In a period in which the difficulties between Turkey and Germany increased, the German company Siemens won the first tender of Turkey’s Wind Energy Renewable Energy Resources Areas (YEKA).
The German media announced that the development was “winning by German Siemens in the huge tender in Turkey.”
DWelle Turkey said in a statement that the Siemens-Turker-Kalyon consortium won the YEKA tender, "The consortium will invest more than $1 billion in wind facilities."
“The tender opened for the creation of a thousand megawatts of wind energy capacity, Turkey’s first YEKA tender is a feature,” the news used that the number of companies competing in the tender dropped today from 8 to 2, the Chinese Mingyang and German Siemens consortiums faced, and the Chinese Mingyang consortium was withdrawn from the tender at the start of the 30th round.
Energy and Natural Resources Minister Berat Albayrak, who made a statement after the tender, made a shocking statement on the relations between Turkey and Germany.
The tender was concluded with the victory of the German company Siemens and we can say that this image is an important message to the region and the world.
When we look at the 200-year historic cooperation between Turkey and Germany, I think this result will make a significant contribution to the relations between Turkey and Germany.
No matter how many regional crises in the world, I was very proud to show that Turkey is in the top of the region and the world’s most reliable investmentable countries.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible match
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who will cross the roads to show the most satisfying boxing game in the near future for £147, met for the first time on Thursday.
The unbeatable World Boxing Council light cycle champion Garcia was in separate rooms at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles until he walked the corridor and greeted the World Boxing Organization super hair cycle champion Lomachenko.
With a vote on Saturday at Showtime, former world champion in four cycles, Adrien Broner, after the defeat of Garcia, both fighters are among the top five members of the list of cycles.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How are you going, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko will defend his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 a.m. at ESPN.
While the two poses for photos, Lomochenko's manager Egis Klimar noted that a potential competition between the fighters would be "in the perfect size".
Garcia reminded me, "I'm an old hair cycle."
“I went to the high for Broner (140 pounds), but I’m not so big.
It is small for 140.
I want to go to a light cycle.
It also has to go through a light cycle (135 pounds), then we can fight.
That’s what the fans want.
Let us give them this.”
Lomachenko has joined.
“The boxer needs this battle.”
Climas asked if it should be in the 'point and track'; setting a next line date with Garcia (37-0, 30 nakavt) and fighting Lomachenko in an opening match of 135 pounds this year is part of his strategy; Garcia is also interested in fighting with the victory of the Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell match for the light cycle title in the Forum on September 23.
Garcia said, "The battle can be on the ground and watch because all the fans want it," and then said that it was open to him if the channel offers the best financial package.
We are the main names.
No other name creates such an interest.
When they are ready...”
Garcia Lomachenko said he appreciated him as a "gigant fighter" and he was able to participate in his Saturday day meeting.
But Lomachenko hesitated in the rear of praise to Garcia and said that three cycling champions from Riverside thought they seemed "very slow," "Sorry, Mikey ... it was naked you wanted."
Garcia said the focus was boxing before showing the power of the blow.
They both said they felt that the moment was created for their own encounters.
“This is a struggle to be done.
Another struggle does not create so much interest and rumors.
Garcia said, “I’m so happy to deal with this.”
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the best fighters and he was Mikey.
It will be a great battle.”
Turkey from Russia to America
The White House does not consider imposing sanctions that will affect Moscow’s pipeline construction, but sanctions against Russia could increase the cost of these lines.
This is due to the increase in debt costs.
The Kremlin, concerned that Western investment partners are considering to withdraw from the projects due to sanctions, has, in turn, accelerated the construction of pipelines.
The Swiss company Allseas Group, which is planning to build the Turkish Stream line to reach Turkey under the Black Sea, has speeded the construction on the request of Gazprom.
Reuters wrote that Gazprom also began the construction of a second pipeline parallel to the Turkish Stream "in a hurry" in order to export more gas to Europe.
The new results of Sweden’s age assessment test
The latest results of the assessment tests of refugees undergoing a new medical age assessment method in Sweden found that more than 80 percent of the participants were older than 18 years of age, but not everyone is confident in the accuracy of these tests.
The Swedish National Judicial Medicine and Drug Administration (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
The tests were designed to make the age assessment in the refuge process more accurate after the Swedish Immigration Agency (Migrationsverket) has criticized some refugees who claim to have not been recruited after failing to assess their correct age.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6880 cases to the test and the Department of Judicial Medicine and Pharmaceuticals has now announced the results of a total of 2481 of the tests from the period from the middle of March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002 candidates) were judged to be 18 or above, and in 25 cases, the Department of Judicial Medicine and Pharmaceutical stated that the experiment was "probably 18 or above."
In 432 cases, the result was that the person was "probably under 18".
The tests were carried out only in cases where the person's age was suspected.
According to Johan Göransson from the Department of Judicial Medicine and Medicine, the results are consistent with the past months.
He told The Local, “We don’t see a big difference in statistics compared to the past months, the figures are quite consistent.”
The high rate of cases found to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that refugees lie about their age.
In May, the apartment announced the results of the 581 test and said that there were 442 cases in which "the examined persons were shown to be 18 years old or older."
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the results of 581 reports, it found that 243 reports clearly stated that they were 18 this year.
The medical age assessment method, which includes taking the X-ray of the 20 year old teeth and making the MRI screening of the knee joints, and then analysing them to dentists and radiologists, is criticized in some environments.
One of the suspects was Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, who assessed the biological maturity of people who had their studies on whether they entered the bullying age earlier or later than usual.
"I have reasons to think about this and I think the type measurement used should not be that.
It is very suspicious to decide the biological life in this way.
If we can’t say it with certainty, we shouldn’t do it as if it was,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson from the Department of Judicial Medicine and Pharmaceuticals defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say the risk of being wrongly judged that a child is an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person is below the age of 18, and in this case the risk is about 10 percent.”
The Stellar Hamidiye Mosque opens for prayer today
The Star Hamidiye Mosque, built by Abdülhamit in 1885 to the architect Nikolaidis Jelpuylo, will be opened to worship today with Friday prayer after the restoration work.
The district director Mürsel Yuri said the restoration work started in June 2013 was completed and the mosque was prepared for opening.
Yellow said the following information: "Restoration work was carried out in 2 scores."
The first part of the mosque was the repair of the main building.
The second part was the environmental arrangement.
In the first part, approximately 16 million lira were spent, and approximately 11 million lira were spent on environmental regulation.
First, the bullets of the wooden cube were opened, after they were renewed, the external walls, the dirt of external factors, were cleansed from the stains.
The drainage was made.
There are very rich decorations as we see when we come into the mosque.
This is a star-motivated work, which is also very rich in terms of pen work.
There is a karma.
"The Selchuklu traces are also seen, and if we consider it was made in the Ottoman and 1885s, the Baroque style has also begun to be a factor in the architecture."
Abdurrahman has a job.
The German Emperor 2 in the middle of the road.
There were partial defects, it was renovated and hanged in place.
It is a very valuable and important piece.
On both sides of the mosque there are symmetrical wooden caves, which we call greetings.
We know that this is done by our self-made mosque-hunt Abdülhamit Han.
So we have the knowledge of how they do it with their own hands and how they are installed here.
They are still standing here in the original way.
The Yellow said the opening ceremony of the mosque was expected by President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
The claim of Pantic in Göztepe
The Ukrainian press that a 25-year-old Serbian footballer who was unable to join the Dynoma Kiev team could be rented to a yellow-red club.
Pantic, which began in the national football team of Serbia, wore the forms of Villarreal, Cordoba, Eibar and Alaves in Spain.
Pantic signed with Dinamo Kiev over the past season.
West Virginia Governor Will Change Party
West Virginia's Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday that he will change his party at a meeting with President Trump.
The Governor Justice said, "Whether you like to go or not, Democrats have left me."
“Today I will tell you with many prayers and thoughts...Today I will tell you as the West Virginiaans, I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor.”
The show drowned.
Justice added, "So tomorrow I will change my registration as a Republican."
“If I was a technical director, it was time for you to set up a different game, I said.”
Mr. Trump has promised that he will make an important announcement earlier at the West Virginia meeting.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and the Democratic candidate Justice did not support Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justice, the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes says he owns coal mines in five states with his father’s heritage.
Its assets are approximately $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Congress on Thursday evening issued a statement saying, "Vali Justice's change of party is another blow to the Democratic Party that prefers to work to prevent it rather than to make our country bigger again."
RNC spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS, “With the control of only 15 governments and at least a number of state legislative councils in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is unleading from the head to the bottom and cannot find a positive, unifying message.”
I will do my best for Turkey.
The third Olympics in Turkey.
He was born in Cuba but called Turkey his own homeland for F.Bahçe.
He became a Turkish citizen in 2013 and dressed the national shape.
He became the first European champion, then the third Olympic champion.
Now it is one of Turkey’s most important medals in the World Athletics Championship.
Yasmani Capello, who competed 400 meters in the barrier, spoke to the morning before the championship that will begin today.
They didn’t want you because they didn’t like their degrees in Cuba when they were young.
You have improved your coach.
Then they called Amabu once you didn’t go.
Some people think you’ve chosen Turkey for your money.
What do you say?
The last thing I remember about Cuba was my departure from the national team.
I can say that from that moment I have drawn a line of the events I have experienced.
Then I came to Turkey with the invitation of the Fenerbahçe club.
The initiative to the national team was thanks to Fenerbahce.
They gave me an offer for supplementation.
I opened a new page with Turkey.
I experienced a lot of disabilities in my youth but after the opportunities offered to me in Turkey, I signed significant successes in Rio and Amsterdam.
I look forward to making the best in the World Athletics Championship and winning a different title.
You have been on a press conference in recent days.
Can you tell us the reason?
When a question is asked about Turkey’s possession of me, I think I’m a childhood, I’m 23 years old and I’m out of the Cuba National Team.
And, of course, people in Turkey approach me.
When I won the gold medal at the European Championship in Amsterdam, I felt like things were stolen.
I couldn’t keep my tears.
I am very grateful to Turkey for the opportunity to realize my dreams.
I am very happy to be a member of the Turkish national team.
I will be here until my legs run.
You have already said that you could be a Turkish lover.
Now you are with a Turk, you have gone to Cuba together.
Do you want to share what you live?
The greatest advantage of being with a Turkish is the tranquility.
When compared to women in Cuba...
Turkish women have their relationships.
Your girlfriend also helps the coach.
Do you get together all day, for instance, with your food?
He’s eating more sweet than me.
(Both laugh) I really don’t have a very strict diet but it’s sometimes mixed with what I eat.
My coach, Massimo Matrone, also often makes hard warnings with my diet, but I know that this is for my good.
How do you find your Turkish girlfriend cooking for you?
Turkish women make good food, but my girlfriend makes it better.
My first preference is the raw potato.
I just laughed at him.
My coach didn’t believe me.
I took other young people in my place.
After winning medals on behalf of Turkey, we met in Cuba.
He looked at my face and showed me to the young athletes next to him and said, “Look, I raised him.”
I just laughed to him.
My eyes are mine.
What are the glasses you wear in the competition?
I use it for concentration.
When I wear my glasses, I cut off my relationship with the world and set a wall on both sides.
I’m just focusing on the end line and I don’t see anything else.
What is the first thing you think about when you talk about Tokyo 2020?
by Felix Sanchez.
He won the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics at the age of 35 at 400 meters.
If he can do it, I can do it at the age of 33 in Tokyo, why not.
Turkey supports
Turkcell Deputy General Director Ismail All said they believe that Yasmani Capello will succeed in London, "We sincerely believe that Yasmani will best represent our flag in this championship."
We wish success to all our athletes to compete in London.
“We will continue to support Turkey for further development and greater success in our country.”
Coe praises Russia's 'shamimi' apology for doping scandal
Sebastian Coe, the boss of global athletics, praised his apology that Russia described as intimate with regard to the doping scandal, but stressed that it was not the right time for the country to re-accept into sport.
Russia's athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress that it was right that his country was banned from sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he apologized to all the athletes who were forced to take gold and silver medals in the competitions.
Despite its assessments, the IAAF Congress voted for the prohibition after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of government-backed doping in Russia in November 2015.
IAAF Chairman Coe told reporters, "Today I think it's a very intimate response, a very intimate presentation."
"The whole council and the whole congress were pleased ... that the Russian Federation accepted it, that it has passed the very difficult days and that it has done everything possible to ensure the reconstruction of the Federation."
Coe said that Russia was “happy” with its acceptance of the re-acceptance criteria.
Coe said, “I think it’s a very constructive day and I think it’s gone, but Congress supports the proposal that the mission is not the right time to return the rights of Russia.”
“We must do everything we can to normalize this situation over the next few months.
Our guide principle has always been to want to separate clean athletes from the defective system.”
Nine Russian athletes who meet the IAAF criteria will compete neutrally at the World Athletics Championship in London on Friday.
IAAF mission chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia has not yet met many criteria regarding the return of its rights.
After a presentation to the IAAF Council in London, he told reporters that the drug test is still insufficient and that banned coaches are still working freely.
The U.S. rejects the news of 'Tank to YPG'
The U.S. Embassy in Ankara said it was not given a tank to any of the sides fighting in Syria.
The YPG has been charged with hundreds of tanks and weapons.
The embassy’s statement, entitled “The statement on the news of the fake news in the press concerning those who go to Syria,” said:
A series of misleading news in the media in the last few days has alleged that the US has misleadingly sent hundreds of tanks and weapons to Syria to support the YPG.
These news ignore some fundamental facts about the current situation in Syria.
The United States has not delivered tanks to any group fighting against Daesh in Syria.
A large part of the U.S. military aid, primarily of light weapons and armor, supports the Syrian Arab Coalition (SAK) elements within the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDGs).
The Syrian Arabs, also covering the SAK, are struggling to clean the Deaqi region and regain their homes.
Head of TYDTA Ermut: Direct foreign investment will be above last year
TYDTA chairman Arda Ermut said that 55 percent of all investments coming last year came after July.
The 15th July FETÖ coup attempt has not been reduced in investments, and the reverse is the increase, Ermut said, "Maybe there would be more increase, it hit the cat."
Per if these conditions did not occur, if there were no regional developments, we could see a further increase with the impact of the shock.
That is why we are more hopeful for the next year.
I hope it will be a brighter year in terms of direct investment.
From the first five months of the year, we are going to increase by 11 percent compared to the first five months of the year.
But we find it not enough.
“We hope it will be more,” he said.
“The need for global or regional developments does not cause us to worry,” Ermut said, stressing that they are trying to diversify investors.
Ermut recalled that normally 75 percent of direct investments by 2010 came from Europe, continuing his words as follows:
This figure fell to 66 percent.
Again, the share of Asia rose from 2 percent to 7-8 percent.
Russia’s share increased.
While we were trying to do this, some Gulf countries had some problems among themselves.
Turkey has good relations with all of them; especially Saudi Arabia and Qatar are two important actors.
But the problem between these two countries makes us troubled and thus allows investors to delay their decisions a little more.
It’s not only about investing in Turkey, but we may experience some delays.
Arda Ermut reminded that some events have occurred in Germany last week, but the government, especially President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has shown a clear and clear response to this situation.
When he spoke to the investors of the countries where the most severe political crisis occurred, President Erdogan’s reaction, “Look, the problems are between the governments, there’s definitely no between the peoples.”
They came and invested in my country.
This does not differ from Turkish companies.
On the contrary, when they have the smallest problems they come to us, we will solve them.
"We will not allow them to be victims," Ermut said, saying that he continued to support all investors with the comfort of it.
Ermut said, “We can give it a guarantee in the next period.”
You will see that neither the German companies nor investors from some countries that we have some political problems in any way will have no trouble.
We are hoping that we will do our best to increase investments from these countries.
We believe that investments from here will continue to increase.
Of course, political developments can sometimes affect perceptions about the investment environment.
“But we will do our best at this point and do our best in order that our investors and the perception of the investment environment not be affected.”
TYDTA President Ermut said that after one-generation one-way strategy, Turkey began to see great interest from China, but if the problems in the Gulf were solved, the biggest investment was expected from the Gulf.
“In relationships with Germany, there is no even one investor who says, ‘We suffered trouble because of these relationships, we had investments because of this incident, we are escaping.’” Ermut, using his statements, noted that there are companies that come, come and follow.
Ermut, "At the moment, about 10 percent of our portfolio projects are German companies."
That is, 10 percent of the companies we discuss from all over the world are German companies.
Some of these are companies that are already investing in Turkey.
The man will grow his investment or has a subject, and he also seems open to us as a project.
“Therefore, German companies are actually still an important part of our daily workflow.”
Ermut stressed that all government institutions should be cautious in the periods when the perception operations were carried out to Turkey, said the issue was sensitive and could be affected by the least bad communication.
Ermut said that what happened in the last 2-3 weeks was a good lesson, saying:
Investors and politicians are always different.
We have always seen that economic relations always make political developments a path.
Germany will continue to be our important business partner and an important investor.
There are a lot of investments in Turkey.
Unfortunately, the election agenda in Germany also increases such statements.
I think when they pass, they will go a little further.
In particular, the two countries are careful not to make negative statements.
Finally, an investor investing in Turkey is investing targeting the markets of all the surrounding countries.
Therefore, not because of Saudi Arabia, but because of the uncertainty in the region, the process has been slightly slowing.
We continue to negotiate with these investors.
My personal opinion is that investors are waiting for a decision that they may be able to make faster now.
“In the negative sense, I see uncertainty due to the crisis between Turkey and Saudi Arabia, I’m going out of here.”
On the contrary, we have Saudi investors who continue to live in Turkey, who on the one hand meet with us while doing their holidays here, and we follow all their processes.
Arda Ermut reminded last year that international direct investments (UDY) came to Turkey were $12.3 billion, "I definitely think we will pass it this year.
“But how long we will go, these regional developments will impact global uncertainty.”
While normally hoping that the impact will be more, Ermut said that it may be a bit more limited, and that it was gone with an increase of 11 percent from the first 5 months, pointing out that it can be preserved, "I hope that if there is no bad development, I believe that the end of the year will be definitely better closed than last year."
Ermut said that a significant part of the investments will continue to be real estate, and that new investments in the fields of logistics, health, fintech, information, petro-chemistry, food, energy and manufacturing could be seen.
Ermut also emphasizes that there will be new investments they will announce in the coming months, "We may be an anonymous in terms of manufacturing in the near future."
Not a billion dollars, but a big investment.
“There may be investments from interest countries,” he said.

How will the financial rules of football affect Neymar's departure to Paris?
The rules to prevent the unlimited spending of European football clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring the world record from Barcelona to Paris-Saint-Germain.
The prestigious Champions League tournament, the management unit that controls the European game, can get any results from the UEFA to Paris Saint-Germain.
The Financial Fair Game Rules adopted by the UEFA in 2011 means that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was funded without a huge loss.
Barcelona was paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of the contract, and Neymar will pay a salary that will get tens of millions of dollars a year.
Some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s visit to France are:
Considering the team’s energy-rich money from the Qatar family, PSG will sign up to Neymar and can of course pay the money to add him to the other stars galaxy.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to get players, but they also have to balance it with their legitimate income sources as they deal with their football-related affairs.
The FFP was designed by Michel Platini, after being elected chairman of the UEFA in 2007.
The former French player believed that the big-duty clubs pursuing his success were effectively fraudulent and that if the banks or owners pull their support, they were at risk of bankruptcy.
In 2011, the FFP began to monitor the losses instead of focusing on the clubs’ debt.
The change meant that the model that Roman Abramovich first used in 2003 in Chelsea (buy a potential club, make high spending to improve the team and create a global brand) became a harder effort.
During the three-year FFP assessment period until 2018, clubs could suffer 30 million euros of damage.
Despite Platini's unacceptable withdrawal from the presidency in 2015, his successor in the UEFA, Alexander Cefer, is still determined to give up without excessive spending.
Andrea Traverso, who manages the FFP at the UEFA, told the Associated Press last week: "The FFP is definitely not dead and we will definitely strengthen by carrying the rules forward."
Although PSG will pay Neymar's purchasing item in a collective amount, it may extend the amount to the contract period for accounting reasons.
Neymar has signed a five-year deal, so the transfer fee can be shown as a cost of 44.4 million euros in the annual accounts of the next five years.
The first wave FFP officers in 2014 saw the implementation of the heavest offices to Manchester City, which was owned by PSG and Abu Dhabi.
PSG was later sentenced to a fine of 60 million euros ($82 million for that time), which was lowered to 20 million euros, and ordered to limit the Champions League team for the 2014-2015 season to normally 25 instead of 21 players.
The UEFA is in the shake against clubs that can try to cheat financial regulators by flushing their income through companies linked to the club’s owners.
Although a Qatar company can sponsor PSG, if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market values, the UEFA will not allow it to be considered a fair income.
This was the case in 2014 when the Qatar Tourism Authority ruled that PSG’s sponsorship was flourished.
Neymar's profit from PSG may come through the payments of Qatar's 2022 World Cup organizing committee.
But PSG and Qatar denied that Neymar would be the world cup ambassador in 2022, and such a move can be easily revealed by UEFA regulators.
Sanctions on PSG in the past means that the UEFA will be even more cautious against attempts to overcome the rules.
The founders said Tuesday that the UEFA was not in a preventive conversation with PSG on Neymar's transfer.
Because they were not authorized to talk about the situation of the PSG, they talked to the Associated Press on a condition that they remain secret.
The latest accounts show that PSG earned more than 10 million euros in 2015-16, with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The financial year’s accounts have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to contribute to sponsorship agreements, gifts and form sales.
The club is expecting that after the signature the cirrone will increase by at least 30 percent.
The Spanish league, which was clearly disturbed by the departure of one of the greatest football players, tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG violated the FFP.
La Liga chairman Javier Tebas pointed to the Spanish newspaper AS, saying that Qatar is the secure owner of the PSG, "This is an open case of 'money doping' with the club and the state."
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, who belongs to his own club an American sports giant, shares his concerns about the financing of La Liga by a state.
Wenger said on Thursday, “This is a result that possession has brought and has completely changed the whole ground of football in the last 15 years.”
“When a country has a club, everything is possible.
Respecting the Financial Fair Play becomes very difficult because such a great player for a country representing a country can lead to having different methods or different interests.
The ‘price’ rebellion of insurers
According to TSB data, the insurance sector has been damaging in the traffic industry since 2006.
The sector lost 2.35 billion TL in 2015, while in 2016 it gained only 19 million TL in profit.
The stock exchange in Istanbul is trading with Aksigorta, Anadolu Insurance and Solar Insurance.
Those who spoke at the meeting in which TSB’s first six months results were evaluated in 2017, said that the 11-year loss in traffic insurance reached 7.3 billion TL, with the application of the roof premium, the sector’s loss estimated to 2.3 billion TL this year, the estimated loss-prime rate will rise to 125 percent.
Age, who said that the 2015 figure will be captured this year, noted that the damages written in 2012 and 2015 lead to the profits of other branches, “This means that by funding the bad driver we increase the price of the citizen’s housing policy.”
“75% of the sector is foreign, and our partners abroad have somewhat funded the bad driver.”
The times continued as follows:
We don’t expect any profit from traffic, but when we look at the last 11 years we can’t show that we’ve earned any profit in the last 11 years.
“We accept this, but we continue to hope that we can carry that damage in a reasonable environment, along with other policies.”
When traffic damage leads to the profitability of other products there are dramatic price increases, "In 2012, there were prices increases of around 30 percent in traffic insurance, it has almost doubled in 2015, we wrote the greatest damage in our history."
“Even in a environment where prices were so high at the end of 2016, our profit in traffic was only 19 million TL,” he said.
They say they are expecting the free tariff to pass next year, "We will lower the price of the good driver in the free tariff and apply high prices to the bad driver."
"But the Treasury is looking at the overall progress, the last word about when it will be in the Treasury," he said.
The Treasury Council stated that the rise in compulsory traffic insurance premiums from 2015 has affected a large portion of society, passing to the application of maximum premiums from April 12.
According to this, the maximum prizes for the obligatory traffic insurance policies for each vehicle group, trail and traffic intensity and accidents statistics are determined on the basis of the provincial groups for the obligatory traffic insurance are determined.
On the other hand, since July, the application "Risk Insurers Pool" for high frequency tracks or vehicle groups in compulsory traffic insurance has been implemented.
Prices and damages relating to the traffic insurance policies within the swimming pool will be shared between the insurance companies.
These insurers will be identified by the Treasury Council.
The ages said that with the application of the roof premium in traffic in the first 6 months of 2017 the premium production decreased by 11.5 per cent compared to the same period of the previous year, and the number of policy increased by 4.9 per cent to 8.6 million, and the reduction in the traffic policy reached approximately 30 per cent, taking into account inflation.
This year traffic will bring profits in other branches again, "These roof prices do not sustain this damage.
How much more damage can the industry carry?” he said.
The capital of all companies in the sector is 9 billion TL, only 2.3 billion TL traffic will be damaged and the capital of the sector will be completed in three years, "Strangers 'Why a good driver funds a bad driver, why my thousands of shareholders funds a bad driver in Turkey?'
“We’re trying to tell the Treasury about this.”
After these developments, on a question whether foreigners have arrived at the weight reduction point in the Turkish insurance sector, “They have not yet arrived at that point.”
They expect to make more investments in Turkey because in the Netherlands an average of 6 polices per person falls, while in Turkey this is 1.3.
"Therefore, Turkey is a place where it really needs to grow," he said and continued:
So they did not give up here.
However, although the company gets a reasonable profit every year, it uses all the profits to grow the company.
According to TSB’s data, in 2016 the premium production in the sector was 40.5 billion TL, while in the first half of this year the same period increased by 12 per cent last year by 23.1 billion TL.
The ages said that the industry predicts that it will not complete the year with a 15 percent growth in total prim production.
Social assistance to thousands of chronic patients
Under the instructions of the Minister of Family and Social Policy Fatma Betul Sayan Kaya, the details and the basis of the implementation of the "New Social Aid Programme for Families Fighting Chronic Diseases" which began work a while ago were clear.
The social assistance program to be launched for citizens and their families in poverty will benefit 4 thousand 300 tuberculosis and SSPE patients in the first stage.
More than two-thirds of the minimum wage will be provided with monthly support and regular psychosocial support.
The Ministry will also make additional payments to patients with tuberculosis identified by the relevant health unit that they are unable to remove their medical self-care, that they continue their lives depending on the bed or the need to improve the home living conditions.
Payments will be made via PTT Social Aid Cards.
Those who are unable to withdraw for reasons such as geographical conditions, illness, disability will be paid at the door.
The program has a feature of being the first in the world in many aspects.
One in 10 companies to invest is still German.
Prime Minister Turkey Investment Support and Promotion Agency chairman Arda Ermut said that German companies in Turkey are seen as a Turkish company that the political tensions between the two countries do not reflect the business world.
Ermut said, “There is no one investor in his relations with Germany who says, ‘We have had trouble because of this situation we are escaping.’”
Ermut, “About 10 percent of our portfolio projects are German companies.”
Some of them are invested in Turkey.
“The Germans make up an important part of our daily workflow.”
Ermut said that the partnership of Abraaj Group with the logistics company Netlog was a good example of this.
The Abraaj Group partner Omar Syed pointed out the economic growth in Turkey, "We have made a total of $1 billion investment in Turkey."
On the way to be the last Ottoman
The management has agreed with the Ottomanspor that the experienced footballer has given two weeks to find the club and will sign an official contract in the coming days.
At the beginning of the last season, Özer Hurmacı, who signed a contract with the green-black club 4 hours before the end of the transfer until 2019, was formed in 29 leagues, 2 cup matches, 5 goals and 4 assistant performances provided a significant contribution to the team.
The management, which closed the way back to Özer, agreed yesterday with Brazilian Sergio Antonio instead of this player.
The transition of the century.
Barcelona has announced that Neymar will transfer to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million euros.
In recent years, the transfer that the football public has followed with enthusiasm has been officially shut down.
PSG has paid 222 million euros to the Catalan team for the Brazilian player, which is the player's release cost.
Neymar was the most expensive transfer in football history.
Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has signed a five-year contract with Neymar.
According to the club’s website, Neymar, 25 years old, who is the world’s most expensive footballer, has signed an agreement that will be formed in the PSG by June 30, 2022.
Neymar, speaking after the signing ceremony, said he was very happy to be in the form at the French representative, “Since I started my football life in Europe, PSG has always been one of the most struggling and ambitious teams.”
I’m going to join my team members and get a lot of cups as our fans want.”
PSG will pay 45 million euros to Neymar each season.
Thus, the cost of the star player will cost the representative of France at a price of over 400 million euros.
The strike of marine workers ended.
İzmir Metropolitan Municipality’s company İZDENIZ A.Ş. and Turkish-Business’s Turkish Maritime Union (TDS) agreement on the increase in the agreement was not provided.
The workers of the trade union were on the 12th of July.
The strike, which lasted a month, ended today at 15.00 after the increase of workers.
According to the signed collective employment agreement, the salary will be increased by 12 per cent on the ground staff within the ISDENIZ.
With the income tax exemption obtained after the registration in the International Ship Registration, the increased rate for staff in the status of shipman increased by 25 per cent and the accepted increase for staff in the status of shipman is 5 per cent.
The IZDENIZ General Directorate announced that the flights in the Gulf will continue at the normal rate, the flights in Yassıcaada will begin on Tuesday, and the flights in Foça and Urla will begin on the end of the next week.
TDS chairman Hasan Pekdemir said they closed the transportation with the strikes lasting 23 days, saying: "Izmir people will relax."
The strike resulted in improvements in the rights of our workers working on land and sea.
We are pleased to leave the table.
The average share in the pocket of the workers in the sea will be 28 per cent and in the soil 20 per cent.
We also had a minimum wage.
We have also improved their wages seriously.
Nostalgia is a niche with "Islak Hot American Writing" and "Companion Detective"
So, for the bright days of the characters in the 80s, for the grunge period in the 90s (when the brains like David Wain and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for himself, that is, in 2001, before the stars continued with bigger things, Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, this version of the story is nostalgic for all of them.
As a cultural product, this is the constant memory of our Facebook period as well as the corporation of it.
But as a series, it’s as if the time is over.
The "First Day of Camp" was unexpectedly successful, and this was not just because of his absurd humor (in it was a story about the origins of a speaking box of the plant, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin.)
Focusing on the basic comedy (playing the children of the mid-age actors who are refined) achieved the impossibility of regaining the past part of the jokes.
The parody is more random, including the monologues related to the minor emotional "After the Ten Years" and the devastating follow-up film of the 90s, such as "The Hand of the Beast".
At one point, the character blends an Apple Powerbook, some one-range wheels and "a lot of other things than in 1991."
Many of the stories are the same.
Soft-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter) is a writer who has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his loneliness.
There is also another crazy deceased plan that Ronald Reagan (Mr. Showalter again) is now misleading by George H. W. Bush (a very well-seated imitation by Michael Ian Black).
The best part of the series is as usual.
Especially it is pleasant to see Mr. Rudd, who always has Matt Dillon's "Backs" in the mouth shell, who his old school's most popular child, Andy, is now looking like a frog.
It may be random madness moments that power this series (e.g. a sort of repeated "Seven Up!" series) until it reaches what I think is the logical result: "Islak Hot American Writing: Twenty Years Later" which in its final scene makes it possible for the friends to go to see the gallery of the film "Islak Hot American Writing".
Meanwhile, Amazon's "Companion Detective" addresses a different type of nostalgia: "The Americans"'s Cold War Resurrection, film "The Black Bomb" and even "GLOW" with the iconography of the East, the West's struggle.
The comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, appears to be TV: a 1980s Romanian police friends drama in which two Bulgarian police officers fought for the real, atheism and Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles are played by the wolf Gregor and the idealist Iosef, Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, and their dialogues are dubbed in English by Channing Tatum (and the main producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
This is a very bright idea.
But that’s not much more than an idea.
There are some pleasant visual comics (Americans spend time watching soccer while the police watch the satellite on TV)
The famous sounding artist staff, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny, is a good material for the game "The Voice Who Knows".
But the "Companion Detective" is so dedicated to the comparison of a narrow propaganda drama to the truth that (including a murderer wearing the Reagan mask) mostly speaks exactly like him.
Six long episodes don't know how to pass and the comedy is not fast enough or frequently.
While Gregor and Joseph are constantly visiting the U.S. Embassy, where two fat men eat a lot of hamburger like hungry wolves in their lobby, the "Companion Detective" would be able to perform the propaganda hicvine better if shortened to a narrow length.
The message to the imaginary communist spectator is that Western culture can turn it into a food that will eat anything in a series.
The Romanian creators are not wrong: we do this to our own near past and even to their own.
The Father of the Father of the Father
The British government has seen our family as a result of fifty-year experience and a sacrifice.
The highest authorities of the government have admitted that this family has been honestly linked to the British government since then and that it is in great service.
It is necessary for the British government to be smart and careful about this plant that it has planted with its own hands, to investigate and examine everything carefully and to decide carefully.
While trying to understand the FETÖ, the organization of the Haşhaşis is considered as a starting point, but a forgotten elementary difference is that the FETÖ is an organization that arises in the imperialist period and moves with colonial facts.
The first thing that should be taken into consideration is that the first thing that should be taken into consideration is that the first thing that should be taken into consideration is the first thing that should be taken into consideration.
In the English praise of the entrance, the person who described himself as "the fidan planted by the British government's hands" is the founder of the Women's Society, Mirza Gulâm Ahmet Kadiyani.
Gulam Ahmed, a small town in the province of Pencap, India, said: "On 1 December 1888, God commanded him to take biat from his supporters and to form a separate community."
Gulam Ahmed went a little further in 1891, according to his revelations and inspirations, that Isaiah died with a natural death, like the other nobles, and that God sent him as the Messiah and the Messiah that Christians and Muslims expect.
The Muslims are the same as the Muslims are the same as the Muslims are the same as the Muslims are the same as the Muslims are the same as the Muslims are the same.
(The Islamic Encyclopedia, TDV)
In India, which was completely under British domination after the 1857 Sipahi rebellion, Gulâm Ahmed, who wrote books that defended Muslims under persecution against Hindu and Christians, reminds Gülen's portrait that defended Islam against non-religion with the Presidency of the Association for Combating Communism in Erzurum, which was believed to have been established with purely sacred ideals but the CIA's support later appeared.
Like Gülen, the most beloved idea of Gulam Ahmed by the imperialists is that the “cihad” is a struggle that the Muslims only do with their own self and that if they can live their religion freely, the imperialism has no dimension to be struggled.
Even if you remember, Gülen had praised even the attacks of the Crusaders, whose wounds in our history were still open, in a last year’s ‘vaaz’ as follows: “The Crusaders’ occupation of your country is not very dangerous.
There are red lines between you and them.
They don’t have anything to do with your wife or daughter.
They are unrelated, unrelated crosses.
The idea that the Mehdi and the Christianity are united in themselves, the idea that their community will be the savior of Islam, the concept of jihad means only fighting with self, along with the similarity of the theses with the FETÖ, the form of dissemination of feminism has also occurred in the field of education and civil society in general.
The total number of women’s centers in the world, according to the report, over 2 million, is 1869, and the number of countries in which the emergency aid organization Humanity First has been officially registered is 23.
It also contains 36 hospitals in 12 countries, 650 dispans in 55 countries, 8 women’s food stations in Africa alone, 505 educational institutions in 11 countries and about 16,000 mosques worldwide.
If we take into account that the Nobel Prize-winning "first Muslim scientist" Prof. Abdüsselam, President of the United Nations Court of Justice, Sir Zaferullah Han, the "first Oscar-winning Muslim actor" Mahershala Ali is also a female, we can see the depth of the approval of global powers to the female.
Let’s note that the women’s meeting with 30,000 people last week in Britain was also bright as a body show.
A short look at their history is enough to understand that the women who have one of their slogans “Love everyone, don’t hate anyone” actually mean “Love your invaders/colonists.”
The starting point and motivations of structures such as Hülasa, FETÖ or Tahir-ul Kadri can be continued to the Women, and all of these organizations are actually supported as a matuff to express societies in order to serve imperialism and colonialism.
The “First Wish”
Emily Pomeranz, who spent her last days in a hospital in Washington due to pancreatic cancer, expressed her desire for milkshake (milk beverage) from a restaurant in the town where she was born.
A friend of the woman contacted the owner of a restaurant named Tommy's.
Tommy Fello, who has operated the same restaurant for 47 years, put the drink in the dry ice and paid a fee of $123 ($435) and sent it to the hospital, 600 kilometers away, with a "fast delivery" cargo.
Two new projects from Ahmet Kul
So far, Ahmet Kul Inşaat, who has implemented important projects such as Lavinya Park, Otoport, Vetro City, Ginza Lavinya Park, Dia Mare in Mimaroba in Istanbul, Solse 7 in Bodrum Yalıkavak and Solse 7 in sale.
The geometry of the Dia Mare project developed by the Chamoğlu Architecture was developed to get the maximum benefit from the sea.
Situated on an area of 11 thousand square meters, Dia Mare has a total of 188 housing and 17 commercial units.
The project, which has completed its brutal structure, will begin to be delivered to new owners in March 2018.
There are many types of apartments in Dia Mare, ranging from 2 + 1 to 5 + 1.
The company, which will activate two new buildings in Mimaroba and Bitez in this year, is preparing to sign two major projects in Topkapı in 2018.
A total of 753 million companies
Peace Friend said that in the TRT, where 6,760 staff worked, many of the programs were performed out and the offspring prices were paid.
The representative of the CHP, in "TRT 2016" again pulled the taxes of the people to the companies of the AKP."
“It’s called theft.”
The source transmitted by TRT to its affiliate manufacturing companies was revealed by the data obtained from the official documents.
The official response to the application made by the CHP Istanbul Parliamentary Party in the framework of the Information Acquisition Act showed how the resources of TRT are spent.
A friend said that in TRT, where 6 thousand 760 people work as staff, although there are all kinds of technical possibilities, through the programs under the name of external manufacturing, a total of 753 million 500 thousand TL was transferred to affiliate companies in 2016.
The representative of the CHP used the phrase "This emphasizes the meaning of it."
Peace Friends, "AKP's journalists and businessmen's production companies are stealing TRT."
“Millions are paid for untouched or untouched works.”
Recalling that the money transferred to companies was collected from the taxes of the public, Yarkadaş, "the institution with 7 thousand employees, returned to the arpa of the AKP."
“These companies have signed what programs that 7,000 people can’t do, and they’ve got that money,” he said.
The advertising income of TRT in 2016 was 224.456.182 TL, and the employee wages and other expenses were taken into account when the advertising income remained a huge hearing.
A friend said, "TRT, which has become the voice of the AKP, does not receive advertising because it is not tracked."

Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
After the Bank of England has reduced the speculation that slow economic growth and moving inflation will be an increase, it is expected to announce that its interest rates will not change.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue "low" due to the fact that their own interest rates will remain stable along with the reduction of family income.
The decision makers at the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates at 0.25%; thus, after slow economic growth weakened the support to increase, they demanded a fewer membership increase this month.
In the three-month inflation report, the bank raised its growth forecasts to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that the income of households will continue to diminish as inflation is expected to continue to rise close to 3 per cent in the spring.
However, he pointed out that the interest rise was necessary to degrade the inflation under Brexit over the next few years, and said that debt costs could have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the huge economic healing package launched a year ago after Brexit.
The bank said it will terminate the Periodic Financing Plan, which offers cheap funding to the banks from February, but it is expected to offer £15 billion more (a total of £115 billion) within the framework of the plan.
Minutes after the interest decision was made, the bank said: "MPC's central forecast, the non-clean domestic income (GDP) continues slowly in the short term as the reduction of domestic real income continues to be a burden on consumption."
As for interest rates, he emphasized that "a slight reduction in monetary policy" may be necessary to relieve inflation and that it will be "a piece higher" than the market expected.
Markets still predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasizes that any increase will be "step-step" and "limited".
According to May’s forecasts, the bank’s reduced growth for this year and next year is compared to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank keeps its forecast of 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After the news, the sterlin lost value against the dollar and the euro.
Pound fell 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 Euros.
The decision to change came after the disappointing latest growth figures relieved the multiplied growth expectations, with GDP being 0.2% in the previous three months compared to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, but according to the bank, it will begin to increase slightly by the end of the year.
While the bank says that the reduction will worsen before it improves, the latest inflation report leaves little to rejoice for the households hit by increased inflation and cash wages rise.
The bank said the monetary policy will not “mount the hit of income” in the next few years, but it expects the pay to be “importantly” improved by the end of its three-year forecasts.
The increase in demand for British goods as a result of the weak pound will support the economy by balancing part of the decreased consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after the shock of the EU referendum, which led the pound to the bottom, the interest rates dropped to 0.25% in August last year.
The bank predicts that it will likely take four years to affect the prices and the economy completely.
Before the bank’s latest interest decision, there was a demand for an increase in the inflation pressure on the hard households and a call for a rise of interest from the three policy makers to a rise of 0.5% in July.
Inflation dropped from 2.9% in July to 2.6% last month, but the bank said it was expected to increase again in the coming months.
The bank said that according to its 2% targets, the excess is "completely" related to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the latest falls in mortgage rates, the mortgage market will once again become more competitive, while borrows are in demand to do business and close the year positively.
On Sunday, it looks good especially for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, with many free options and low interest rates becoming more popular than ever.”
NHS will prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
In the Supreme Court, after a struggle for the financing of the drug in the NHS, patients will be able to reach the 'reversive' HIV preventive treatment from September.
The NHS UK announced that pre-exposure prevention (PrEP), a pill taken before sex, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk people by about 86 percent, will be provided by health care services to approximately 10,000 people through a 3-year pre-test.
The Supreme Court's ruling last year agreed to finance the experiment after the approval of the Court of Appeal. In the ruling, the NHS was said to have the power to pay for the PrEP, despite the claims that the local authorities were funding.
The move, announced on Thursday, was welcomed as a "new and serious intervention" by NHS's UK president Simon Stevens, while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described it as a "return point".
Sex health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first registered clinics for the public, with the participation of more clinics in October will be fully implemented throughout the UK until April 2018.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a series of HIV drugs that reduce the risk of getting HIV before sex.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV among those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that a person has enough medications to prevent HIV infection from placing in the body.
These medications can be taken every day or up to two hours before having sex.
Those who are suitable for treatment are gay or bisexual men, transgender persons and HIV-positive partners and who cannot be successfully treated.
The clinics will identify the appropriate participants who will agree to the experiment from men, women, transgender individuals and unknown persons where their partner’s HIV status is controlled with an anti-retroviral treatment.
Those who live in the UK and are registered with a practitioner may also be registered for potential participation in the participating local sexual health clinics.
The program will hold £10 million and the NHS UK has signed an agreement to supply drugs this week with an international offer.
The test was designed to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how PrEP is targeted, performed and applied on a large scale.
Mr. Stevens said: "This new and serious intervention will contribute to widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another kilometre in the thirty-year development to overcome one of the major health problems of mankind.”
Deborah Gold, Chairman of the National Aids Trust, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
If targeted right on those in need and those at risk, PrEP offers the possibility of converting the HIV epidemic in the UK.
From September, people with high HIV risk will, through this experiment, funded by NHS in the UK, reach a new and powerful tool that is truly individually controlled and is not open to negotiations with a spouse; this will lead to a healing of many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement.”
Ian Green, Chairman of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority should be to ensure that the current experiment is delivered rapidly across the country and that no one with HIV risk is left behind.
As the PrEP experimental drug is now supplied, we are on the right way to protect more than 10,000 people with HIV risk.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We welcome the start of the PrEP experiment and it has been late with months of delays and then the government’s footsteps.
Evidence shows how transformative this drug can be in the end of the transmission of HIV as part of our view and life-changing infection.
The experiment will make us a step further to fully understand the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that this experiment be presented as quickly as possible across the country to protect people exposed to HIV and make us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.

Two Secrets of Death
Former Minister of Industry and Trade Ayhan Çilingiroğlu's daughter, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, who was born in Washington, died falling below the 19th floor of a business center used as a hotel in Istanbul Levent.
The 24-year-old student Melis Salihoğlu was found dead in his home.
Sally’s self-righteousness was revealed.
The investigation of the two secret deaths that were traced and considered suicide by the police has begun.
There was a depression.”
The daughter of the first Minister of Industry and Trade of Turkey, Ayhan Çilingiroğlu, born in Washington in 1966, Umit Makbule Çilingiroğlu, entered the Le Meridien Hotel in Etiler on 1 August at 17.00 p.m.
A Kuwait tourist who was sitting in the room on the 19th floor and saw the dead body of Chilingiroğlu, who was not for a while, told the hotel administration of the incident, the ambulance and police team were called to the place.
The health team has determined that Chilingiroğlu, who fell from the 19th floor to the hard floor, has died.
The mother, Mediha Çilingiroğlu, told the police, "There was a depressive state in recent times."
On July 31 he arrived from Ankara to Istanbul.
I have a kid of my other daughter.
"This was concerned with my grandson and was negatively affected by my grandson's disease."
The funeral is expected to be buried in Ankara.
It is investigated whether he was shot by someone or he committed suicide.
“Canina Kiydi”
The other suspicious death in Istanbul occurred in Sarıyer Zekeriyaköy.
Melis Salihoğlu, who was studying at Koç University, was found dead in his home.
According to the allegations, the young girl's father went to her daughter's house near school, where she didn't get any news and had no mobile phone.
The father found his daughter's body in the house.
His family, close surroundings and friends, who were very loved by Melis, claimed to have ended his life by hanging himself in the house.
The death of Melis Salihoğlu destroyed his family and his relatives.
After Melis, a friend on social media said, "A bright bright sun was striking on our face."
Under our feet, the greener grass, the best friend Jack and his sister Eyşan and we were enjoying running for that small plastic ball.
“It was necessary to share the message to death now.”
Living a luxury life: Asma floors and smart design numbers have transformed this small Earls Courts apartment into a luxurious house.
Former bankier Joanne Leigh, who was passionate about real estate repair, went to the smallest by moving from a large house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The spectacular Queen Anne style is a proof of the new design that a fan is on the first floor and Joanne is convinced without collecting their bags.
"Before, I lived in a much larger area in Knightsbridge with my former boyfriend," Joanne says.
“I was looking for something for my price.
The apartment in Earl Court was shown to me and had the same high roofs.
I fell in love with him and gave me an offer that day.”
After the first view, the 1000 square ft apartment was renovated from the beginning to the bottom.
Initially, it was a single-room and complex planned property; you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom. Joanne generously wanted to add a storage space and a hanging floor to make maximum benefit from the height of the roof.
“I wanted high roofs, big windows and a lot of light.
That’s my condition,” he said.
For this purpose, the Notting Hill-based architecture and design studio holds Erfan Azadi from Duck & Shed to take advantage of the 12.5 ft roof and create a place where Joanne will live, not only a building.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two areas in a row, so the architectural challenge was to create a hanging floor in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
“The steel skeleton is quite complex,” he explains.
"We should set the emptiness in such a way that they can accumulate on each other without having to go down.
This was not just building a simple platform, but the steels would also be so inclined that they would be at the right height according to the function above or below.”
This arrangement also brought many additional dramas, allowing Erfan to get two full-size rooms over each other.
The old type of bakery light window, taken from Retrouvius for the lifting floor, looks at the wonderful living area below.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver emphasis and the old type of Serge Mouille lighting all determine the style of the design.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding space, space and light.
The mirrors placed on both sides of the short corridor make it look longer.
The mirror protective panel in the kitchen gives the feeling of a window opened to another room.
Interde mirror units provide storage space for Joanne's entire craving knife and craving machine.
The beauty of the living room that creates a more wonderful area perception is to be able to close the kitchen when it is not in use.
The kitchen is not new.
The original thing in this is that it is a garage-style door that can be lifted up.
Erfan explains the steel-fortified curved MDF door, "We used some engineering in it."
"It has a balance weight so when you push the door up, it is really easy to slide."
With the smart use of the area and storage space, Joanne has gained an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved seating plan.
“At the end of the day there’s something you’re going to sell the seating area, or the value of your property is determined,” says Erfan.
"As an authority, a real estate owner will enter and make a calculation based on the seat area."
Here they managed to use high-quality materials that give the area a luxury appearance while increasing the ground area.
Erfan says, "The materials are the objects you touch and thus help you establish a emotional connection at home."
"At home, you won't fall in love with the electric lines on the wall.
This is important, but it doesn’t tighten the wings of your heart.”
This is proof that through good design and increased square meters, an apartment can turn from a standard thing to a pretty wonderful thing.
In fact, like Joanne, you can choose not to leave.

Brothers struggle for a $500 million property empire
The two brothers are in war for one of Victoria's greatest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million, four decades after the Italian family's establishment.
Former Carlton Football Club director and contractor Colin De Lutis lives three doors away from his little brother Paul, who gave himself to the Supreme Court about how to share his property and business assets in a property in Toorak.
Paul wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but hard discussions on the breakdown were ongoing at the Supreme Court.
With their mothers Anna, their brothers and sisters Smith Street, in Collingwood, possess 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since they bought them in 1973.
There, the family founded the Westco Jeans and grew it into a chain of 160 retail centers.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money has been deposited in property and the portfolio of De Lutis currently includes city offices, Brunswick and Sorrento contractual fields, Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Under an agreement with his dead father, Colin (Paul described as a "important driving force and dominant personality" in the De Lutis family) owns two-thirds of the company’s assets, while Paul owns one-thirds.
A court file says that this means Colin had a property worth $316 million and Paul had a property worth $176 million.
The division of property and cash for Paul appears as a controversial issue.
In his first sworn statement to the court in 2015, he wrote: “The distribution proposed by Colin left him with the property I’ve always attributed as the best.”
The first high court trial was held last Friday after many failures in the mediation.
The brothers are also struggling about who will control the current business; Paul claims that Colin has left him out of the business.
Colin claims that this is not true, but he accuses Paul of malfunctioning some property.
Colin says in a sworn statement at the beginning that he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots tell me that family is the most important priority.”
Hundreds of pages recorded by companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, e-mails and the costs of the case are increasing along with the best lawyers such as Allan Myers, QC and senior legal prosecutors held by both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her dead husband, Luigi, were an Italian immigrant family operating bakes and singers since the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Colin was kidnapping his property to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family’s first shirt shop.
Colin says that "in my last few years, when Paul was a little boy (10 years old)" he founded Westco there.
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, are hoping to leave her property friendly to her sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted his brothers to fall to court.”
The other two brothers Mark and Luke are no longer part of the De Lutis company group; according to Colin, when he left his job, he was paid $10 million to Mark and $26 million to Luke.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the conditions of their financial divisions."
According to the 2015 biography of Eddi McGuire, the best friend of the television star, Colin tried not to draw attention, although he was a former member of the board of directors of an AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Just because Colin was in court with a short message, he replied, "I can't say too much."
"It was very sad that my brother Paul preferred to prosecute me and brought the name of our family to court," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, Colin wrote that he was trying to meet his brother’s demands in a court application.
"Our father, Paul and I didn't want us to fall into the current dispute," he said, adding that he was still hopeful of a solution.
On Friday, this hope seems to be lost.
Colin wrote, “Our problem will be resolved by the courts in the near future.”
Trump’s new private pen plans to restrict the presidential media diet.
The others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do that.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House private pen will limit the flow of information to President Trump (including news media reports), hoping to keep his boss more stable.
A few little news from journalist Josh Dawsey:
"When the White House's new private pen John F. Kelly met with senior staff on the first day of his work, he summarized a fundamental problem President Donald Trump planned to solve with regard to the White House: the faulty information passed into the president's hands.
Kelly told the staff that the information should flow through him, whether on paper or with brifings, because the president could make better decisions when good information was given.
Kelly’s diagnosis sounds very meaningful but others tried to adjust Trump by monitoring the media diet and failed.
President Trump’s relationship with television is going decades ago and he’s now in the White House, the TV show is still in good condition.
A former campaign adviser, Sam Nunberg, told Politico in February, “If Aday Trump is sorry for not being fairly placed in the media, it would be productive to show him that he finds a fair place in convincing media organizations.”
Tara Palmeri from Politico then wrote, “According to six campaign officials, the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control was to ensure that personal media consumption contains a stable stream of praise.”
well .
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit is “under control” at any time is ridiculous.
Per these campaign officials know something that the rest of us don’t know, for example, Trump’s tweets will be much more provocative if they don’t intervene.
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If the elements were able to get him out of danger even several times, then their efforts were valuable.
But no one could stop Trump from creating constant debate.
Some of the problem was that the White House was made up of parties competing with each other, that is, in any case, trying to advance their agenda with the materials they presented to Trump (this could be reliable or unreliable) and people who stand out their own world views.
Politico in May, throughout this story, the tendency of consultants to communicate strategically suspicious information to the president.
One example of the report by journalist Shane Goldmacher was the following:
"The current and former Trump officials say that Trump has reacted sharply from the press to the negative curves, especially to the leaks that have a bad impact, and that he is engaged in finding out where they came from.
At the end of February, one of the presidents, the internet provokator Charles C. Johnson's site GotNews.com, disrupted a printed copy of an article accusing private pen assistant Katie Walsh of being "a source behind a series of leaks" in the White House.
It was no matter that Johnson was fundamentally banned from Twitter because of harassment, or that he did not provide any concrete evidence, or that he had been directed and returned from accusations in the past.
Trump read the article and began asking staff questions about Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that at the time private pen Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "prove to place a system that manages and documentes the documents Trump received."
How did this result?
Kelly tries to do the same after three months.
Per it will appear as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still in his own impulse and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchanged factors will make Kelly’s task quite difficult.
Crypto FETÖ's colours revealed with special template
Izmir Republic Prosecutor Berkant Karakaya completed the investigation that the secret witness named "Sarmaşık" code in the framework of the investigation on the misconduct in the "military spy investigation" and the investigation that the secret witness named "Sarmaşık" code began on saying that the Navy Command Staff Chairman Tümamiral Cihat Yaycı is FETÖ'cü."
In the review, it was emphasized that, contrary to the fact that the Amiral Yaycı is not a member of the organization, he helped the investigative authority in the decryption of members of the crypto organization in the Navy Command and played an active role in the fight against the FETO.
In the decision noted that Yaycı was attempted to be passified by ordered by the Maritime Forces Command according to the so-called order of the strike attempt on 15 July, it was six points of the fact that Yaycı gave an effective struggle against the FETÖ from the first day of the strike attempt.
In Karakaya's non-responsibility decision, the following statements were used: "It is clear that the applicant has worked on the identification of the personnel of the Crypto Navy Command, thanks to the special template for the identification of members of the Crypto Private Services class and 64 basic criteria and the special system created through 209 sub-criteria."
As a result of the struggle, which is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization, as a result of the struggle, where a special and intense effort is observed, the secret witness has no evidence of the name and no evidence of the non-founded declaration, and a predictive assessment of the Publisher, which is known to be an active anti-terrorist organization and has great contributions in this direction, is not possible to be assessed by our General Prosecutor's Office.
He was previously charged with harassment.
It was also revealed that there were again FETÖs and the alleged crime.
The former Air Pilot Kurmay Colonel Hakan Dinç, who was in the complaint that the Publisher insulted him, was the former Adana Incirlik 10 who converted the complaint in the form of information notes.
Tank Base Commander Air Pilot General Bekir Ercan Van, former General Assembly President Adli Müşaviri Colonel Muharrem Köse, former General Assembly President Intelligence President Korgeneral Mustafa Özsoy, former Judge General Erkan Ağın, former Maritime Captain Necmettin Aksoy, former Judge Captain Akif Us and former Judge Captain Serdar Çamiçi and former Judge Captain Mustafa Çiçek, who were declared as witnesses against Yaycı, were expatriated from TSK due to their links with FETÖ.
Some members of the organization, including Tuncay Opçin, who fled FETO, appeared that they targeted the Publisher with their social media sharing before and after the July 15 coup attempt.
Travellers crossed the hole, returned to 'the rich neighborhood'
Some of the wealthiest hosts in the West Midlands are again in struggle with determined travelers who exceed the council's harvest to recover the area outside their own property.
The travellers parked their 20 karavans outside the street in Solihull's state and the area called 'Richers' neighborhood.
The council brought horses, babies and a full cargo car and returned after being expelled in May.
The intelligently moving group found a vacuum in defense and fled into the vehicle by setting a road from a barrier-free part.
The angry inhabitants criticized the Solihull Council by saying that it was "unsurable in solving the problem".
One unnamed quiet said, “The passengers came there on Monday evening after they were sent from Bentley Heath, where they were throwing stones.
The council should be ashamed of its actions because they are useless in solving the problem.
The travellers were there in May, they were sent and now they’ve returned.
“There was more yesterday night, and more will probably be today.”
He added: "Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this with the long-distance decisions taken to protect parks.
I live in the streetsbrook street and I’m not happy to continue paying my taxes while the council can’t even stop it.”
A resident of the area, who didn’t want to give his name, said, “As a joke, we saw the last group of passengers still gone and we were immediately destroyed by a new group.
The numbers were increasing this time, and even a horse was sitting in the park."
A spokeswoman from the Solihull Council said: “We are aware that there is an unauthorized camp on the streetsbrook street ground, we are starting the necessary legal procedures to send them from there as soon as possible.
To support our proof collection, it is very important that as many local residents as possible call 101 to report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police.
This will help the image of the situation appear to the court to be taken into account when we submit your case to the court.”

The CHP Parliamentary Member, Nadir Ataman, issued a earthquake warning on the rise of giant buildings on the coast, noting: "The Dava's report clearly says that these buildings will not tolerate earthquake with a magnitude of 6."
It is stated that the rocks that the solid rock is below 25-30 meters are not so deeply harvested.
Istanbul Ataköy high-storey hotels and residents that lay a wall between the sea and the ground on the beach left the district unhealthy.
CHP's Bakırköy Municipality Council Member Nadir Ataman reacted to the huge AVM, hotel and residential projects that rise one by one in the district.
Ataman noted that the buildings on the coast cut the wind, "80 years ago those who planned according to the wind created the Atatürk Forest in Florence.
Eighty years later, the point of understanding of urbanism was reached, and the wind corridors were built by giant clouds and changing the climate.
“It doesn’t breathe at first.”
Ataman said that the buildings that rise like a wall on the Ataköy coast changed the balance of the climate: "Temperature is feeling 10 degrees higher due to the heavens."
These buildings need to be built according to the direction of the wind.
But our clouds rise above the wind corridors of Istanbul.
The wind doesn’t get in.
These structures disrupt the natural balance of life.
Ataman said that these clouds that damage the environment and human health have also cut the connection of the Bakarköy people with the sea, and they will appeal to the Monuments Council on the matter and go to court.
Healing without surgery is possible.
In cases of phenol application, it is seen a success of up to 83 percent.
In this method, the sick tissue is effectively cleansed and the tissue emptiness is filled with an agent that kills the hair roots.
The second method of therapy is the laser method.
With a variety of lasers, the roots of the hair and the tissue around them are burned thanks to circular radiations, and during this burning, the tissue is closed by attachment.
Thanks to these two non-chirurgical methods of hair removal, patients can return to their social and business lives in a shorter time.
Overweight, unmotivated life, long-term sitting, doing business, intense hair and body clothing and non-compliance with the hygiene rules, Dr. Mert Atak indicates that the symptoms of the disease have been found that there are disorders such as pain, infection, apse and swelling.
Italy Strengthens NGOs' Approach to Immigrant Rescue Boats
Italy has warned NGOs operating migrants rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they will not be allowed to continue if they do not comply with the new rules affecting their operations.
In an interview with the Torino newspaper La Stampa, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said, “If NGOs do not comply with the new regulation, it will be difficult to see that they continue to operate.”
Minniti's warning came one day after the Italian authorities arrested a boat operated by the German aid organization Jugend Rettet, suspected that the crew was effectively cooperating with human traffickers in a way that would facilitate illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has only been active for a year, refused to comment on the contents of the detailed accusations against them by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
In a statement on social media, the organization said: "For us, the rescue of human lives is our most important priority and will be so we are very sad that we are currently unable to work in the search and rescue area."
"We can only make an assessment of the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and have been able to evaluate the situation."
Italian officials have been monitoring the Jugend Rettet's boat Iuventa since October.
The crew is suspected to have taken the immigrant boat filled with tire boats directly delivered to them by human traffickers and allowed the traffickers to escape by boats, to be reused.
According to the prosecutor’s files published by Italian media, at least one such meeting, according to the allegations, took place at a distance of 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya.
The crew is undergoing to ignore the authority of the Italian coastal security, which has taken care of the rescue operations in the region due to a lot of humanitarian effort for another purpose.
According to the regulation, there should be an Italian police officer on the roof of boats like Iuventa who clearly monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the regulation: Save The Children, Malta-based MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter of them said on Tuesday that he considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable because it would not cause any "serious changes or obstacles" in his own rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, the Nobel Prize awarded organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the last weeks' rescue was a sign of efforts to strengthen Libya's coastal security and cooperation with local governors.
The minister said: "In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
This month, the Libyan governors announced their plans to negotiate more on economic development initiatives and take measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave the country with the hope to reach Europe.
The Last Minute!
In Moscow, the capital of Russia, the "parashutist troops' day" was celebrated as each year, the carpuz was defeated and the vodka was drunk.
The Russian NTV television reporter Nikita Razvozjayev, who was involved in the event and was broadcast live in a Russian Gorky Park that was stolen from alcohol, was attacked.
The reporter, who translated the developments of the day in the live broadcast, warned the man who appeared at a moment and cried, “We’ll shake Ukraine,” saying, “Please silence.”
The drunk man, who said he was a former parasitist, threw him a heavy blow on the warning of the reporter.
The reporter, who struck him, tried to get away from the man.
Millions of people watched the shock in live broadcast.
The Economic Coordination Committee
The Economic Coordination Council (ECK) was held under the presidency of the Vice-President of the Economy, Mehmet Şimşek.
After the Cabinet Change in the Government, the ECK meeting, held for the first time in the Lightning Presidency, began at 18.30 a.m. in Chankaya Köşkü.
The meeting will discuss the macroeconomic perspective of Turkey.
The meeting was attended by Minister of Finance Naci Ağbal, Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Faruk Özlü, Minister of Work and Social Security Jülide Sarıeroğlu, Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci, Minister of Development Lütfi Elvan, Minister of Treasury Osman Çelik, President of the Central Bank Murat Çetinkaya and related bureaucrates.
You can get rid of it in 45 minutes.
Dr. Son Karaeminoğulları, who noted that only 5 percent of patients should be operated in the treatment of bacterial dysfunction, said: "The first step according to the patient's examination and imaging results is rest and drug treatment."
Specifically in the patient group where the pain continues that initiative methods (such as epidural injection, radiofrequency techniques, in-disc initiatives) should be tested, Son Karaemino Sons warns, "If all of these methods are not achieved success, sleepiness and weakness in the legs are manifested, then surgery becomes mandatory."
The Karaemino sons, expressing that today the risk is minimized by the "total closed back spine surgery" also allows to reduce the worries about the surgery of patients who cannot be achieved by initiative methods, says that it is possible to get rid of the back spine disease in 45 minutes:
Although microscopic surgery gets quite good results compared to open surgery, you may face some complications, such as a long period of recovery after surgery, clinging to the spine, repeating the spine, and back swelling and infection that may develop in the future.
Most of the time, microscopic surgery is defined as 'closed surgery', but microscopic surgery is also applied in the same approach as open surgery.
In the full closed back spine surgery, these risks are eliminated because the surrounding tissues are protected.
The full closed back spine surgery lasts only 45 minutes.
The Special Committee
The committee will include CHP members Mehmet Gökdağ, Cemal Okan Yüksel, Peace Friend and High Discipline Board member Turan Aydoğan.
The Commission, Berberoğlu's 4th October in Istanbul 14.
He will also follow his trial at the Heavy Criminal Court and the applications made to the Constitutional Court and the Regional Court of Appeal.
CHP Secretary-General Kamil Okyay Sındır and Vice-President Bülent Tezcan signed the mandatory letter, "The independence and neutrality of the court, the absence of orders from anywhere other than the law, is the indispensable condition of justice."
“Our deputy Mr. Enis Berberoğlu did not demand any special status while performing his office of parliamentary office, he did not refuge in the arms of untouchability recognized by his parliamentary office, he wanted to preserve his belief in the independence and neutrality of the court.”
The judgment process was suggested that the court preferred to exercise political orders instead of conducting trial.
In the letter, the Constitutional Court claimed that, despite the decisions that the members of the parliament found their arrest wrong, the decision of arrest was made without determination of the judgment was a clear proof that the court decided under the influence of it.
Michelle Carter sentenced to death for messages encouraging Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through messages and telephone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will take a 15-month sentence behind her fingers and five years as a legitimate release.
Carter was convicted of murder of Conrad Roy on July 13, 2014.
Mr. Roy's father said on Thursday: "My family's heart was broken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to be released in order to be open.
If he was faced with a maximum of 20 years of imprisonment, his legal team claimed that both he and Mr. Roy suffered a mental illness.
Carter, wearing a red pants and a cream-colored bluz, was so old with his eyes, his hands wrapped and his eyes looked at the ground while he was punished.
The prosecutor told the court, "His actions killed Conrad Roy."
He ended his life to heal himself.
He did not accept responsibility.”
“He didn’t show him any regret.”
But Carter’s lawyer said, “It was a terrible situation that he was completely regretted.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn’t see any significant impact on his age, level of maturity, and even mental illness’s actions.
A prosecutor read a statement from Mr. Roy's mother Lynn Roy: "There is no day that I will not regret the loss of my beloved son.
I want you to be proud of me and how I have overcome everything, and I try to be with her sisters with all my suffering that we will bear forever.”
Mr. Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that the reality that his brother would never attend the wedding or that his children would never be "out of mind."
“It’s a pain that’s always going to be with me for the rest of my life that you’ve been with me every day since I’ve been born.”
It appears that the case will cause a person to say he commits suicide because there is no Massachusetts law that considers it a crime.
Mr. Roy was 17 years old when Carter was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a car in 2014.
The case attracted national interest when Carter's short messages revealed that it encouraged him to end his own life.
When she was on vacation with her family, the girl said in many messages she sent two weeks before her death: "Have yourself, jump out of a building, get yourself with a knife, I don't know there's a lot of ways."
In the moments before his suicide he wrote: "You must do this, Conrad" and "The only thing you have to do is open the generator and you will be free and happy."
Judge Moniz, giving instructions that it should not be allowed to benefit from the case through the press, said Carter wanted to attract interest through Mr. Roy's death.
The legal opinions were divided.
Amanda Knox was accused of killing her British room friend in Italy in 2007 before she died two years ago.
Mrs. Knox (30), published an article in the Los Angeles Times, saying: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison."
An impressive growth forecast from Mehmet Lightning
Shimshek said in his statement that inflation in Turkey should fall to low one-digit figures and said that food inflation is a "risk zone".
Deputy Prime Minister predicts inflation to fall below 7 percent in 2018.
In his lightning speech he said:
It is critical for the next 12 months to reduce uncertainty.
The biggest incentive is the reduction of uncertainty.
There is a strong government.
There is no political uncertainty.
I hope the uncertainty in our nearby geography will also be reduced.
By increasing our resistance to shocks with some reform, I believe that we put Turkey on a growth trend of more than 5 percent.
I said it months ago.
The worst is behind.
Slowly, we will no longer bring our energy to those areas, but to the reforms that will bring our energy to comprehensive growth and employment growth.
The next 12 months are critical.
On the one hand, the reform, on the other hand, the uncertainty is reduced, there is no political uncertainty.
Hopefully we have the chance to get rid of the difficulties in our nearby geography.
Whether we want or not, many of our classical markets are broken down.
Libya is like Iraq.
We’re not just losing Sunday, we’re facing over 3.5 million immigration waves.
When we look at the last 15 years, Turkey has grown by 5.7 percent despite all these shocks.
Turkey, that is, our foundations have strong problems.
Now with a bit of reform, increasing our resistance to shocks, a bit of more deleting the question signs in the head of investors, we put Turkey again in the growth policy of over 5 percent.
To be honest, I am from here, we have such a generous pension system.
If I say that our retirement companies do not do enough effort, I think it is reasonable.
Once the performance will be strong.
Why ?
Because we got cautious.
Companies don’t have to spend and spend.
By observing these concerns, taking into account that performance is weak, we have made a crackdown in the form of how we will allocate global assets to which areas of investment.
You know the revenue is high.
Once clearly the government’s 25 percent will be performing there.
The rest of the deposit is in treasury papers, and there is a low risk.
When we look at the big picture, I think the interest will increase in the next period.
They will see the performance.
There is no failure, there is success.
We restored the BES in 2013.
We have 6.8 million participants, we have an accumulation of £70 billion.
The system has been successful.
There are also 2.6 million participants in the automatic participation, and there are 775 million pounds of savings.
We want more efforts from the companies.
Let them make some advertising, let them tell this system.
We work in time.
Maybe if we put it a little...
We look, we work.
Maybe the citizens see the return and see the accumulation and stay in the system.
38 percent of the system.
Nearly half of those dismissed are volunteers.
You don’t want two individual retirement accounts.
What are you doing?
You are out of participation.
We were expecting about 10 percent.
That means we are very optimistic.
The system is working once.
We brought a top roof.
Insurance companies sometimes unilaterally explain.
They increased their premiums very quickly.
When asked what happened, they said the court rulings did not take into account the current regulations.
We made a new net arrangement.
We said you should do it too.
They said not, we are waiting for the judgment.
We said that it would not be so.
We have a division of ideas here.
Of course, when this roof passed to the prim application, some firms were imitated.
We made a new arrangement.
Insurers have built a swimming pool.
I will say it, I will repeat it.
I prefer this system to work through competition.
So these roof price applications I don’t find right, they forced us.
I would like to look at this three-dimensional.
Consider the system we do.
Two, the system will work normally, a price on that track.
Additionally, the burden is heavy, every £100 premium paid almost £30-31 goes to the tax cuts of the SGK.
I’m also working now, we’ll talk to our finance minister.
Thirdly, technology is developing rapidly.
Now, with time, traffic accidents will also decrease dramatically.
This is a compulsory traffic insurance.
The Morning Manuscript Saved His Feet
The Buerger disease, which emerged from adolescence, was once a disorder seen in men, but nowadays it has begun to occur frequently in women.
One of these women is the 36-year-old Mehtap.
The pain that began two years ago was chronic in the bottom of the foot.
The young woman, who had to walk, had the risk of losing her leg, went to the hospital.
A friend recommended Prof. Dr. Yusuf Kalko.
The news showed that the "Azerbaijan Emergency Minister's life was saved."
It was then revealed that Dursun, who went to Kalko, fought Buerger's disease.
Dr. Kalko took the young woman to an emergency surgery.
Shortly after he was getting rid of his pain, he now sees oxygen treatment.
Audi will modify 850,000 diesel vehicles while facing reverse reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of the BMW Board said, referring to European cities, including the BMW’s headquarters (where the prohibition or restriction of diesel vehicles is considered) Munich, the company believes that “there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions.”
Daimler said on Tuesday that three million Mercedes cars in Europe will modify to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies did not describe these movements as recall.
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles to help meet carbon dioxide emissions in Europe and the United States.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines reveal add cancer-builder and can cause asthma.
The cost of the equipment that automotive companies need to wear to neutralize the dirty smoke that diesel vehicles produce is also increasing, making it difficult for cars to remain competitive.
While German automotive manufacturers face investigations, the chancellor Angela Merkel’s government was also accused of blaming powerful automotive companies and ignoring the order of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's errors that hid that they use the device known as a misleading device and adjust emissions to the regulations when a car is tested and relieve it in normal driving conditions.
Many Volkswagen managers are accused in the U.S. and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Audi’s engine development department, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is an Italian and therefore not defended against his repatriation and can be prosecuted in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was driven into a German criminal investigation, including Volkswagen; authorities had expanded the U.S.-based investigation after accusing Audi of installing a system to get rid of the emission rules in Europe.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation may be heavy to Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer has an excessive profit in Volkswagen’s profits.
Don’t jump to fishing everything you see.
The President of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, Prof. Dr. Yusuf Şükrü Çağlar, warned that the depth of the fish is uncertain, and that the fish should not be jumped to the square places of 2 meters.
Every year, thousands of people are at risk of stroke due to neck fractures and damage to the spine.
The thickness of the neck often develops in the 5 or 6's spine.
The characteristic of the breaks is that it affects the muscles of the arms and legs at this level as well as the nerves that feed the respiratory muscles.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar, “In these types of accidents, our most valuable organ, the neck spinal area, is cut by the spinal that is broken due to a broken or compressed, is disfunctional.”
"The wrong first aid in the injuries in the distress can not only increase the damage in the accidents, it can also lead to death."
Dive in water fishing is ranked fourth in spinal injuries.
The average age of the injured is 20-29 and the majority are men.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar says, “Fishing in the water that is not visible should not be jumped.”
“While you go well, you can get a serious injury.”
Prof. Dr. Age also reminded:
Depending on the level of spinality in the place where the injury caused during fishing can occur in the arms and legs at different degrees.
You may know how to swim, but the water can be fraudulent.
A place that may seem deep to you.
In the U.S. and Australia, the warning sheets placed on the shores of the sea resulted in a 70 percent reduction in fishing cases.
Prof. Dr. Çağlar said, “In Turkey, although there is a sea coast of 28 years, there is unfortunately no single warning table in places outside of Istanbul.”
“In relation to this kind of life-threatening accidents, every summer before the health department of each province, under the schools and social awareness projects, information lights or information panels should be placed in the beaches and swimming pools in a noticeable way.”
The head of the Spinal and Peripheral Neurosurgery Group of the Turkish Neurosurgery Association, Prof. Dr. Kadir Kotil, suggested:
The first job is to call 112 at the time of the incident.
The neck should be kept as stable as possible, should not be moved, should be detected with a hard catch.
The air path should be provided and the patient should be placed on the reverse side for the drainage of the water that flows into the lungs.
It should not be kept out of the legs and wiped out of the water.
The disorder in the patient's neck should not be tried to correct.
The neck shoulders may be broken.
But if the spine has not yet been damaged, an inappropriate position to be given during the first aid and the patient’s move can cause broken bone parts to press the spine and cut and damage it.
The Provence lavender is under climate change threat
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is under climate change threat.
Lavanta is experiencing a decline due to dry-like conditions and disease-bearing insects, and this situation causes scientists and farmers trying to find a solution to a major headache.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at CRIEPPAM, the Provence-based Agricultural Research Institute, said: “Lavanta in Provence is effectively under danger because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change, which brings much less rain in spring and mostly in autumn.
This affects the life of the lavender.
There is also a small August insect, which is harmful to a leaf that transmits microbacteria, and it occurs more than them in very dry air.”
And many things are in danger.
For the perfume and cosmetics as travellers attract, a lot of lavanta oil is sought.
Eric Chaisse said, “While we have a few large flowers to have a very long plant flower, we have a smaller, less developed or no or weak flower.
So we have fewer essential fat pieces.”
The reviewed solutions include improved water distribution and slowing the evaporation from the soil, but there is also the spray of a plant-protectional wheat and water mixture and the development of species more resistant to dry conditions.
The murder of a journalist brings gold to the rising threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce often meet on Wednesday to review the latest misconduct caused by organized crime in the state of Sinaloa, corrupt officials and plans for the release of endless drug wars in the newspaper.
But on this day, they gathered together to talk about their security in the shadow of their own tragedies.
They were told that it was important to change their routine.
Two senior journalists are discussing what makes them feel safer: bringing their children with them to the office, which was the target of a hand bomb in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Safety experts wrote three words on the black table in front of the room: thieves, neutralists, allies.
They ask journalists to suggest names for each column; no evidence is needed, perceptions and inner voices are enough.
The journalists suspected that drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, government or cartels are bound to pay, a list full of Mexican chaos makes the work of writing in the newspaper dangerous.
There is no paydos in violence, while the number of bodies is increasing across the country, more of them are journalists: According to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, President Enrique Pena Nieto has taken office in December 2012 at least 25 people; 589 after attacks and threats are under federal protection and this year at least seven have died in seven states so far.
Among the last deaths are the writer's work directors and inspirational sources Riodoce's founder partner Javier Valdez Cardenas.
Valdez, "The greatest mistake of living in Mexico and being a journalist," writes in one of many books about narcotic violence.
His absence is deeply felt, but his presence is everywhere hanged on the front of Riodoce's building with a large photo showing Valdez's middle finger with the word "Justice"; two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his smile, his glass face and the Panama hat, which is the latter.
The workshop takes place two months after his death; journalists talk about his common trauma, nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two of them were prosecuted.
Every year, as with the majority of thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, journalists’ murders are rarely brought before law.
In Riodoce; although their hearts are broken, the ground is now more fraudulent, they insist on referring to violence in Sinaloa.
Without information about the murders, without justice, security talks are very little useful, says Ibarra.
“It’s stupid to spend my time in this work.”
“Unless we don’t know why, you don’t trust anyone.”
In the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce's office in the state's capital Culiacan.
The Red Toyota Corolla could only take a few blocks before it was stopped by two men; it was forced to be removed from the car and shot 12 times, for the name of the newspaper, which is estimated to be translated as the Eighth River.
The armed man drove away by his car and hit the car nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
His wife and two adult children remain.
The rumors in Culiacan tend to circulate freely.
But about Valdez there is almost nothing but silence.
After Guzman's arrest last year and his return to the U.S., the opponent groups struggled to fill the vacuum, while Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battle areas in the country.
Let one or more people be shot and killed on the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with more than many larger, decorated, two-storey, mosols of the drug kings to live.
For a minute, forget that only a single cartel controls the valuable ports and the drug trade routes to the United States.
Despite this, and despite being deeply aware of the dangers of Valdez’s business, Riodoce’s founding partner and director, Ismail Bojorquez (60), was destroyed by guilt because he failed to protect his friend.
He believes the two mistakes have contributed to the murder.
The first was an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival cartel groups that were fighting Guzman's sons in a February edition.
This article may have angry the sons; the potential gang members have purchased every piece of pressure undistributed to the newspapers.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the same story was taken over to another newspaper.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his murder was seen as a turning point in Mexican violence against journalists.
He was alive for a long time, and his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.
He was an experienced journalist in Noroeste in 2013 when he participated by selling $50 shares in the revealing of Riodoce to his five business partners.
In Sinaloa, it was "impossible to do journalism without referring to the topic of drugs," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper gained fame with its brave and honest news, and the sales and advertising increased.
The journalists loved publishing life-giving research without fear of censorship, and the readers put themselves into a publication where they could read stories that no one could dare to communicate.
Riodoce, eight years after its establishment, won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for its communications in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage to pursue wherever the end of the Mexican drug story stands.
He clearly acknowledged he was afraid.
During the CPJ awards, he said, "I want to continue to live."
In an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said drug trafficking in Sinaloa was "a way of life."
“As a journalist, you must accept the task you have, either you’re a fool or you’re a fool.
I don’t want him to be asked, ‘What did you do in the face of so many deaths... Why didn’t you say what happened?’
Riodoce staff misses Valdez; the unfaithful joker like hamal, his friends who are generous in his embrace and advice, his teachers who know how to survive.
They trust his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went to the bar called El Guayabo in front of the office and was always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for his routine broken?
His death forced them to question their own assumptions about how best they would do their work and survive.
“If you deal with their women, their children, their clean jobs, their hidden flight trails they use to transport drugs, they don’t like it.”
Bojorquez said, “These things were to cross the boundaries.”
The result, even at the best time, was a high degree of self-sensure and self-protection.
Trust in your own instincts.
If you have a bad smell, stay away.
Andres Villarreal, Director of Writing Affairs in Riodoce, said, “The smell is a deceitable feeling... and what has happened to Javier has happened.”
He and others say that the old rules are not valid in Sinaloa; the same Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and a toxic mixture of profitable trafficking routes, weak institutions and other states that host corrupt government officials are not valid...
The ground is constantly changing.
No mobile phones were allowed at once in the room where Riodoce staff met for security training; days ago, it was revealed that spy software sold only to the governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
On the outside, two police officers wanted to get rid of a temperature of 104 degrees (40 Santigrat) in the shadow of a tree.
They are assigned by the state government to preserve Riodoce's office located in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half the joke was half serious, some of the journalists were wondering whether these officials were from the 50 percent of the police in which the governor himself said he was not reliable.
The journalists went to the mountainous countryside where drug gangs were actually controlled for months.
In this week, Riodoce has three main stories.
Former great boxer Julio Cesar Chavez's brother was murdered in Sinaloa.
In addition, there was a disclosure of government spending concentrated on the governor's homeland.
A group was kidnapped in Culiacan’s most expensive restaurant.
There was no official explanation of who was kidnapped or how it was, so when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew, the warning dominated: the restaurant was a fan of both drug traffickers and authorities.
A journalist learned from official records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a member of the Corporate Revolutionary Party (PRI) in the administration, which dominated almost all stages of the past century politics.
Recently, many PRI governors are accused of corruption in sensational events.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about the events that occurred before, including the escape of one of the sons of "El Chapo" Guzman from a soldier's press.
Only months ago readers would look at the corner of Valdez for the best source of information about the kidnapping.
Because of its thin structure, Villareal, 46 years old, called "El Flaco", said, "We already knew what was happening first."
“All our communication channels with our sources are now interrupted.”
The staff turns into something they never expected, activists in the name of the press, while Valdez's office is reused as a warehouse for pancards and removal protests against the murders of journalists.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few pancards and went to a demonstration for another journalist in the local prosecutor's office the next morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the murder of Valdez in the western Michoacan state.
A burned body was found and according to DNA tests officials say it was it.
Journalists across the country, in organized protests, have expressed their thoughts with a heavier voice by writing "Help to the Bay" to the lifts and buildings.
Today, Director Bojorquez is trying to provide international support for justice in the case of Valdez, far from Washington.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa after Valdez was killed, Ramirez accused authorities of spying to journalists and killing them because they said the truth.
After that day, he sought to be assigned to a job other than to make government news, considering that his anger was neutral.
Valdez continuously said that journalists in Mexico were “circumcised” by organized crime, criminal partner officials and an unrighteous society.
In his last book, “Narco-Journalism”, he wrote that journalists are being killed not only by drug gangs, but by the order of politicians and security forces in cooperation with organized crime.
The media observer group Articulo 19 linked more than half of the attacks on journalists last year to police and officials.
Ramirez said, “You’ll die in Mexico because they want to keep you silent.”
The murder was clearly influenced by cold shower.
No one has forgotten the death of six years ago blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
The body was found along with a note said it was signed by the Zetas card: "I am here because of my news."
A computer keyboard and headset are sealed next to its broken head.
In the northern border state of Chihuahua, after the murder of journalist Miroslava Breach in March, some publications such as El Norte preferred to close.
After his executives were murdered in 2004, the other continues like El Manana from Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez called to the drug cartels with the following title on the front page: "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists fled from their own states, even from their country.
This is a burning decision.
It’s hard to find a job in exile and they’re still scratching the streets waiting for danger.
Sometimes, three months after fleeing Veracruz, the photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in a apartment in Mexico City in 2015 with four women, is seen as clear.
A dance made every day with these high-risk decisions for those who stay behind and continue to work.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says she was scared to report about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell and that’s why I’ve become a journalist.”
In the midnight of a nearby Saturday night, while the preparations for the final number were undertaken, Riodoce writings managers were sitting on the elevator outside the office and drinking beer, while they began to steal the phone at the same time.
A series of armed conflicts, including rival gangs and security forces near a resort on the coast of Mazatlan, caused 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued as promised in a series of cartel messages around.
The news was posted on Riodoce’s website via their mobile phones.
The first page should be changed the next day.
The sirenes began to rise nearby, there was a conflict with another weapon around.
Bojorquez quickly checked the police officers who kept the guard to see if they were trapped.
Even if they were afraid they would not show.
Under the enormous portrait of the defeated founder of his newspapers, his middle finger was displayed to the view of all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
“How can you think about closing,” said Bojorquez, “at the day that Javier was killed, while the internship asks me to send him out to tell me in the street?”
The dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies.
It looks like a statue at first glance, but a terrible one.
The researchers now revealed that the first findings of an incredible creature in the gergedan size found by a Canadian miner were well preserved, and the experts described it as the “Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they could understand that the pul pul skin was red and brown, and they could say that it had a 'problematic past'.
A report in the journal Current Biology described it as "one of the best preserved armed dinosaurs found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world."
Fosil is a newly found nodosor species that lived 110 million to 112 million years ago from the middle of the Cretaceous period.
The extraordinary well preserved state has confused the researchers who described it as 'really wonderful'.
The plant feeding armor is the best preserved fossil found in its species according to National Geographic reports.
It was discovered by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in North Alberta, Canada, while winning the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray.
He hit something that seemed strange according to the rock around him and decided to look closer.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The following six years they spent discovering the wild animal from the 2500 pounds (1100 kg) of land.
After such an intense work, the result is now ready to be revealed.
Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is exhibited, said, "If you cut your eyes a little, you can even believe that he is almost asleep."
"As one of the most beautiful in science history and the best preserved dinosaur species, it will pass as the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
The researchers, by examining its skin, found that although it is covered with arms and looks like a walking tank, this plant’s food is likely to face a serious threat from dinosaurs eating meat.
The dinosaur, which was quite heavy arms, used the red and white camouflage to hide from the devastators and used a protective technique known as counter-shadowing, which is also used by many today’s animals.
Experts say it is hunted by larger dinosaurs, allowing them to better interfere with their surroundings and overcome their enemies.
The creature, a 110 million-year-old nodozor family, first appeared on the manuscripts in May and is currently exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
The researchers have now completed their work and named the wild animal Borealopelta markmitchelli to the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of the teams that spent more than 7,000 hours hard to discover it.
The extraordinary preservation of the species made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists to design the shapes and document the arms on the body.
They discovered counter shadowing, which is a common method of defense in the animal world and means that the upper part of the creature is darker from the bottom.
Although contrast shadowing is common, the findings are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is far beyond the contrast shadowed animals that are alive today.
This means that the dinosaurs are under sufficient pressure and hunt by the dinosaurs who eat meat, and that evolution also prefers to face hiding as a way of survival.
But the most contemporary animals that use counter shadowing (e.g. cows, zebras, or armadillas) are much smaller and much more obvious to be a hunt; that means that this nodosor had a serious difficulty to survive.
Brown said, “The strong hunting applied to a heavy armored animal shows how dangerous dinosaurs in the Cretaceous can be.”
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their pules also revealed that the dinosaur's skin was red and brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about life, including preserved intestinal content, to find what they ate in their last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur dies, he falls into a river and is thrown into the sea, where he has drowned into the surface of the ocean on his back.
At that time, Alberta, South Florida was as hot as today, and probably the rivers and oceans were spread to much more content than it is now.
Brown said, “Nodozor is fully covered and preserved with dirty skin, and it is really worth noting that the original shape of the animal is also preserved in a three-dimensional manner.”
"The result is that the animal is almost the same as it looks in early Cretaceous times today.
You don’t need too much imagination to rebuild it; if you cut your eyes a little, you can even believe it is almost sleeping.”
It was the time when the massive teropods, the two-footed massive dinosaurs, travelled around the Earth.
Although the king of them all, Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years after the armed dinosaur Borealopelta, which could be hunted by a group of his vast ancestors.
Among these, there is also Acrocanthosaurus, a monster with a length of 38 ft (11,5m) and a weight of 6 tons.
The latest findings are found in the journal Current Biology, and scientists believe that Borealopelta was thrown into the sea after his death and mummiated in the dust.
The creature was discovered by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 when he grows the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, the best preserved armed dinosaur, including skin and arms, is complete from the nose to the neck.
The creature is an average of about 18 ft. (five meters) and weighs up to 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two of the shoulder has a 20-inch length of neck.
The researchers believe that this armed grass was driven to the open sea by a stunning river until it is now in the western Canada.
But the dinosaur's submarine grave preserved its weapon with perfect details.
The fossilized remains of this particular species have been so well preserved that the skin pieces still cover the full-fledged arms layers along the dinosaur's cavity.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this degree of conservation is as rare as winning a "piangoyu."
No matter how much I look at it, it becomes incredible.
Fossilated skin pieces are still covering full-scale arms layers that are located at the point point in the dinosaur's neck.
The right front leg lies on its side, with five fingers moving upward.
I can count the feet on the bottom.”
Do not whiten your teeth.
White teeth and an aesthetic smile are the dream of every person.
While people apply to various ways to whiten their teeth, Oral Laser Applications Association Chairman Nükhet Berk warns that it should be avoided from products sold on the market or on the internet.
Nükhet Berk says that selled such substances draw the mine surface, that the teeth are colored in such a way that they will no longer be recycled, "the whitening of the teeth can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porselen surfaces attached to the surface of the teeth, such as a nail."
Berk notes that the preservation of dental health prevents the formation of many diseases, and that aesthetic applications are important in terms of mental health by providing both the health of the tooth and the tooth and the possibility of a beautiful smile, sharing the following information:
Unless there is a disorder or genetic factors in the tooth structure, the teeth of young people are usually white.
As a result of ageing, the drawing of tooth mines and the frequent consumption of smoking, swallowing or dark-colored beverages, the teeth get darker in years.
Whitening of teeth can be provided with chemicals applied by dentists or with thin porcelan surfaces attached, such as clothed nails, applied to the surface of the teeth minimal or without any injection.
Your teeth should never be whitened with products sold on the market or on the internet.
Because, these substances draw the surface of the mine, the teeth are colored in such a way that it will no longer be recycled.
The Keçiören Municipality, from 2011 to this side, provides "Dental and Oral Health Service" to elderly, disabled and sleeping citizens.
The 65-year-old Köksal Güngör, who has been sentenced to bed for 24 years in Keçiören's Awakening District, "My husband has been aware of this service from the Keçiören Municipality."
We called the town and they arrived immediately.
“It’s already a paralysis below my neck, thanks to this service, I don’t ignore my dental care at all.”
Kezban Gökçe, the 72-year-old daughter of the 95-year-old Gülizar Taşçıoğlu, who lives in Pınarbaşı Mahallesi, said, "My mother has been addicted to bed for 7.5 years because of ageing."
When I came to the town, I saw the poster of this service and immediately called it.
We have been taking this service regularly for 4 years.
I have a problem with my teeth, and when the doctors come, they look at me as well.
He used the words “very pleased.”
There is no health insurance obligation for the service that is completely free.
The Turkish Army’s “Cadema”
Dear readers, the meeting of the High Military Shura (YAS) last day took very interesting decisions, especially in terms of the Navy.
This force was brought to the command of not an oramiral, but a coramiral.
This is an unprecedented practice in our army.
So how did this happen?
Army commander Oramiral Bülent Bostanoğlu had completed his term and was already retired.
And it happened.
Now the command order came to the only Oramiral Veysel Kösele.
Veysel Pasha, who had been the victim of the crash in the past and was detained for a while, had to be a commander in the normal senior ranking.
But the government did not want it.
I’m trying to explain very briefly, if we started from the top in the Navy, the 1, 3, 4 and 5 commanders were not promoted.
There was only one officer in the Navy.
He had to be brought to the missing office: Commander of the Navy of the number two, Oramiral Veysel Kösele.
What happened after?
On the sixth place, Coramiral Adnan Özbal was appointed by the government.
Now look at this picture!
Oramiral Veysel Kösele stands there but a lower-range commander is appointed instead!
He is committed to an unprecedented command.
What will happen after that?
An oramiral who is superior to the rule, does not do, or does not do, under the command of a corgeneral who is unrighteous to him.
He does not receive orders, he does not receive.
In this case, Veysel Kösele will not tolerate this harmful situation, if he has not been retired, he will resign today or tomorrow.
This is the blessing message given to him by the government: "Go goodbye to Veysel Pasha!"
I wrote this post yesterday afternoon, the news was spread that he resigned in the hours of the afternoon but the situation was not officially revealed yet.
Let’s look at these things again!
The government opposed Veysel Kösele for this or that reason, did not want, forced him to resign and brought a sixth-class coramario to the command instead of him and undermined our army's traditional "Kedem" concept.
There is no policy, and we do not know the back of the curtain.
Maybe if someone says it soon, we’ll all learn together!
Dear readers, I have tried to tell you very briefly above, especially in the Turkish army, the incident is very important.
Not just as a rule.
For example, the officer who finishes Harp School in the 10th place is higher than the one who finishes in the 11th place.
The first ordinary promoter to the generality is greater than the second promoter.
We’ve seen the examples of this incident.
The Garp Front Commander named Pasha.
There are two armies in order.
The Army and the Second Army.
In the year 1922, our armies will make a great bullying and expel the Greek army.
There are valuable names expected to be appointed to the Army Command.
One is Refet (Bele) Pasha.
He is offered to command the army, but he says, "Isset is uncommon than me, I can't enter his command."
Another name is Jacob Shevki (Subaşı) Pasha.
Professor at the Harp Academy of Atatürk.
A valuable and high-ranking commander he loves, he appreciates, he calls "My Master" and has participated in various wars.
In 1919, the Turkish soldiers and civilians were captured and deported to Malta by the British.
When he returns home, he is unwilling about the command of the army and says the same things: "The western front commander is unwilling from me, I can get orders from him."
But Ataturk convinces him to be grateful and Jacob Shevki Pasha accepts the command of one of our two armies.
The third is a very colorful name.
Ali Ihsan (Sabis) is Paşa.
He is a soldier who is constantly criticised.
A commander who fought in Iraq, the Caucasus, Iran and various fronts.
He is also deported to Malta by the British, escaping from there and coming to Ankara through the Kuşadası.
When he was offered the command of the army, the same thing Ali Ihsan Pasha said: "I can't fight under the command of Ismet, who is unknown to me..."
They are convinced...
But let’s see that, after the beginning of the mission, the commander of the Garp Front, who has entered his command, is constantly discussing with Ismet Pasha, releasing the incident and disturbing the army.
And shortly before the great torture, he is taken out of office and retired, and the shark Nurettin Pasha is brought to his place.
After that, Ali Ihsan Pasha's relationship with Atatürk will never improve.
The problem in the Turkish army emerges not only in war, but also in peace.
Of course he must go out.
This is the last example.
A activist had to find out how to answer the question "Who's the streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was deeply shocked.
One day after coming to New York City to travel, St. Louis was sitting on the bed of the airbnb he rented and began browsing on Facebook on his phone.
It was a part of someone from high school.
“The police recently killed a 18-year-old boy and he’s still lying on the street,” he said.
She was surprised when she noticed that no one else shared this information in the content stream, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user named @TheePharoah was constantly re-tweeted in his content stream.
A rapist from St. Louis district tweeted Michael Brown's death live, who was killed in Ferguson Missouri by a 18-year-old, unarmed black and white police officer.
She shared a photo of Brown's dead body in the street for four hours.
Ferrell thought to himself, “This is brutal.”
But death was not something new for him or his society.
He left his phone to return to tweets about the gathering of people on Canfield Drive the same evening.
Police bands had pictures of a man holding a pancard on which he wrote, “Ferguson police recently killed my unarmed son!” and who claimed he was Brown’s father.
A police officer watched a live broadcast where a group of protesters stood with a swallowing dog.
In another video, another police officer, as he said, set up his pistol and shouted, “I’m going to kill you all... animals.”
Ferrell remembered that he said, “This is not usual.”
“This is not the type of murder we are used to and we can call it typical.”
I felt scared at that moment.
I was angry and crying.”
He booked a ticket and went home the next day.
After arriving at 11 a.m., he took his six-year-old daughter from his father’s house and decided to go with him to Ferguson the next morning.
For Ferrell and Ferguson, what will happen in the next three years will be the subject of a new documentary entitled "Who are the streets?" on August 11.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, power and resistance from the perspective of people living in that society and filling the streets with the answers they are looking for.
While Ferrell drove his car to Ferguson with the girl who was dressed in a flower dress and worn a crown suitable for her, they returned to the talk they had repeatedly done that morning about the "experiences of the black and the situation of the black."
“Do you remember that I taught you that black people should fight because they believe?” he said.
“We’re going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn’t true.
I couldn’t take it out,” said Ferrell later.
What is happening today is the result of what was happening in the past.
He must know it, see it, and grow into it.
It should not only develop well in the field of activism and organization but also know the layers of the black experience and the black state and liberation, what we should do to liberate ourselves.
Even if I was so lucky to give her an experience that brutal racism would not personally experience, there would be no difference from any black woman-child.
I feel that I will be making him evil by protecting him from this.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, their first stops were on the South Florissant Road, which was in front of the police center and they were waiting for a speech on the subject that resulted in that the officer Darren Wilson was not later convicted of the crime, which became a nevi camp area for the activists.
There Ferrell and her daughter established contacts with local business owners preparing packed food.
They prepared the bags and helped bring them to the protesters.
A new kind of activism was gradually forming for Ferrell.
As a student at the Missouri State University, he said that he was the chairman of the Association of Minority Students Nurses and that he focused on food justice and injustice in health in the black society, "My activism turned completely after August 9."
“I had no experience of organizing.
It came by itself.”
Several weeks later, Ferrell met in a evening show with Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-producers of the film.
Folayan said he and his own picture director Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "documentate" what happened.
Ferrell came to mind with a question: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can use?"
This doubt was often by a number of people, including the white, who came to a society to benefit from their suffering and resistance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: “We’ve heard that the voices of people born and growing in Ferguson can’t concentrate and we decided to do it differently.”
Folayan has already established a relationship with the regional artist, co-regisseur Damon Davis, known for his activism in relation to the prisoners sentenced to death.
His participation warmed Ferrell to the project, along with the other six districts' indigenous as well as the "Who's the streets?" team followed it in the years after Brown's shooting.
David said, “This documentary is not that someone speaks for us or speaks to us; we are the speakers.”
“For me, that’s how these people will be represented, because that’s how I will be represented.”
Folayan said, "While the goal is not to focus on Ferrell's experiences, the movement is not about "a miserable leader, it is about the gathering of society," he demonstrated that the film participants are the most open, he spoke in the form.
As a result, "Who's the streets?" surprisingly documentes the personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as being in love and married to his wife.
Ferrell, laughing at the first glance of the finished product, said, "I felt like naked."
"But while doing this and humanizing the black people, I realized that there could be some sensitivity."
Also, Ferrell's story reinforces and re-centralizes the role of black gay women in the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who launched the slogan #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of the black young Trayvon Martin in 2012, describe themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in the leadership generally kept the movement standing,” said Ferrell, “and that’s because we are constantly fighting on many fronts.
Black gay women must bear all the weight of it.”
Folayan added: “The movement is really held up by black women and many gay black women.”
However, Ferrell insists, "when there is nothing in the sort of positive action" and when it is not selected because of his identity.
He says, “He was the one who moved this energy.”
“But it’s not a coincidence that she’s in front lines, because there’s a lot that you’ll lose by living a life in these crossings as a black gay woman.
You can feel his energy from the screen.”
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have already gone, but there are worried racial connections between the community and the police.
Ferrell is under surveillance for another 2.5 years due to the closure of the highway during a show.
The social-political atmosphere in the area I call home is defined in a single word as "complex".
Nevertheless, Ferguson keeps the song he grabbed in his memory just three years before he went out to the streets.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
Winning is our task.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Kyrie Irving: The world is not round.
Irving told NBC Sports, “The world is not round.”
The world is straight.
They practice such things by frightening people.
My friend, no question.
For the more information you solve, the more information comes out.
This is madness.
Is the world straight?
Or do they turn around themselves?
I think you should investigate this.
I tell you, they lie against us.
They lie to us! he used his words.
Irving said, “I believed I wanted to believe for years.”
I thought the world was round and turned.
Do you really think we are back in the solar system?
Nothing they sent returns.
He is not back!
The information they give us is very incompatible.
The truth is here.
You just need to look for this truth.
“Do you understand what I’m saying?” he said.
Kyrie Irving, who claims the world is straight, is fighting this season with the Cleveland Cavaliers form with 24.4 numbers and 5.9 assist average.
The artist uses Chelsea Manning's DNA to create portraits
In the middle of the room in the New York Fridman Gallery, there are a lot of white, black and brown faces, which are wrapped through the roof cables, each of which is almost uncertain and similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, from ear stripes and cut hair sent to him by Chelsea Manning.
Former intelligence analyst Manning, who was sentenced to 35 years in prison after the secret diplomatic messages were scattered through the WikiLeaks channel, sent his cut hair from the prison in Fort Leavenworth.
The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is a similarity.
This is a product of two-year communication between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines his discipline with his expertise in technology, computer science and art, and a trans-woman, forgiven by Barack Obama, who has been sentenced to three days until his term, and a leading opponent, Manning.
Dewey-Hagborg, who created 30 portraits using the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and what a person with this gene data could look like, not only revealed the processability of the DNA data (there are many ways to be imagined and determinism from the essence of the comments), but also revealed his identity with a strict, somewhat brain interpretation.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but clearly described himself as a woman in his adolescence, was sentenced to 20 crimes in 2013 according to the Spy Act, computer fraud and theft.
His image was pressed by the prison, so that he had only one photo: a sandy, black-white sculpture in which Manning, apparently annoying, was sitting on the driver's seat, worn a platinum yellow curtain attached to him.
In 2015, the Dewey-Hagborg project in 2012 was successfully achieved with the enormous summary of More Strange Predictions.
In this, the artist produced portraits by drawing the DNA from the eruptions of legal pieces such as cigarette ismarites and garlic to draw a picture of what these people could look like.
I received an email from the Paper Magazine.
"They were making an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait that could accompany this post," Dewey-Hagborg said in a press show of the new exhibition.
At that time it was not possible to visit, the photo was not taken, so they arrived at Chelsea and asked if they were interested in making a DNA portrait.
The artist and his imprisoned inspiration became unexpected letters friends by making many letters exchanges over the course of two years.
They even revealed a cartoon book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, where the president forgives Chelsea's punishment and his exhibition can personally be seen.
The fact that Obama really asked for Manning's release a few days after the book was released was a happy coincidence after seven cruel years in a military prison in Kansas.
While Donald Trump finds new, tweetable ways for the inflators of the information about the government and the transgender soldiers to start war and make the sharp divisions he wants to repair, there is something deep and strong about this exhibition that is currently opened.
When asked about the strange timetable of all this, Dewey-Hagborg said, “Things happen for a reason.”
A artist's statement on the wall of the gallery that Manning's large-scale signature is under it (the point of the letter "i" in his name is placed with the heart), calling for the end of "automatic discrimination" based on gender, race, gender and culture.
In front of the wall, it has its mitochondrial DNA sequence: many C, G, and A, written with a pen...
Including 200 letters (or the nucleotides according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey Hagborg wanted to explain how surprisingly we all, at least as a biological creation, are similar to each other.
“What I hope people will get out of it is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open and subjective the genetic data is to interpret,” said Dewey-Hagborg, who was showing his 2007 video work in the Imitation Memories.
"DNA data can tell a lot of different stories, and this is 30 of these stories."
The last piece of the exhibition held in a single room is a page of the short cartoon that was previously mentioned.
Here Manning, King Kong style, is shown as it comes out with a speaker from the U.S. Disciplinary Countries.
“They’ve kept your speech silent, they’ve won.”
“So never silence.”
The artist from Philadelphia said, “This came directly from a letter he wrote to me.”
“When I’m talking about it, my hair is shrinking.”
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition (as he dreamed of the cartoon in a very predictive way), but when he sees it, he will be greeted by the masks of his own genetic imitation gathered as a group of protesters in the middle of the room.
Like everything in the exhibition, genetic haplogrups were written with a pen to the length of Manning (5"2, the length of Manning), which was made specifically.
Dewey-Hagborg said about the portraits, “I’d put them on the wall in the past but I wanted them to feel like a crowd.”
“I wanted it to be perceived as a massive movement formed with Chelsea, which is also a movement behind his liberation.”
Northwestern educational officer and Oxford University staff are searching for murder
Police said a country-wide hunting was launched for Northwestern University educator and Oxford University staff, who was sought after a man was found killed by a knife in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
Cook's administrative district records show that on Monday, arrest guidelines for first-degree murder were released for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) allegedly involved in the assassination of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Documents say that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died after being shot several times.
In a warning published by the Chicago Police Department, a body was found on July 27.
The officials took a phone, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with many deep cuts in his body.
Official sources said Cornell-Duranleau was to have died at the scene and the police actively searched for two suspects while detectives were investigating knitting as a murder.
Lathem has been a doctorate at Northwestern University in Microbiology and Immunology since 2007.
The University Relations Vice-President Alan K. Cubbage said in a statement by e-mail that Lathem was under administrative trace and that entrance to Northwestern University campus was prohibited.
Cubbage "This is a criminal case that is under investigation by the necessary authorities and the Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation."
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman from the University and the University of Somerville said in a statement: "We are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help the U.S. investigative authorities in any way they need it."
The statement also said Warren's business colleagues were shocked and wanted to be surrendered.
Chief Communications Anthony Guglielmi from the Chicago Police Department said he strongly encouraged suspects to surrender to authorities.
Guglielmi said, “The police have an idea where they are, but our efforts are focused on finding them.”
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities helped to find the suspects.
Guglielmi, from the Grand Plaza building manager, who has received a mysterious clue that something has already happened in the 1008 apartment, said the police received a phone call.
Police described the scene as terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident was on July 27.
Lathem and Warren said they were in the building was confirmed by security cameras.
Guglielmi said, "We believe that the victim has a relationship with the teacher Latham."
The management staff at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents saying: "The police are still working on the victim's timetable and history and investigating a series of facts, including a possible family event."
Italy drove German ship
Italian police have that the ship Iuventa, which is in the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean, was captured on the island of Lampedusa.
The police, which also shared the records of the telephone conversations they claim to belong to two members of the organization with journalists, announced that the operation was carried out within the framework of an investigation launched by the Trapani Prosecutor's Office in October 2016.
Youth Rettet’s members, allegedly acting in favour of illegal immigration on the Libyan-Italy line, have brought refugees to Italy at least three times directly from the ships of Libyan human traffickers.
The charges of the Jugend Rettet members, which are prosecuted by the Prosecutor's Office, include the allegations that they committed the crime together with some of the Libyan Coast Guard members.
In a statement from the organization, it was stated that their priorities will continue to save human lives, and they are evaluating the accusations addressed to them.
In addition to the ships under the Italian coastal security and the European Union (EU) mission, approximately nine international civil society organizations are also responsible for the search and rescue of refugees in the Mediterranean.
The Italian government has prepared a 13 article Code of Conduct to comply with these organizations and required it to be signed.
Last minute: Five boys of Banli who attacked Bigkerşen were sealed
After the attack on Eskişehir Metropolitan Mayor Yılmaz Büyükerşen was arrested by the police, the five buffets that the retired police Mahfuz Banlı rented from TCDD were sealed by the Tepebaşı Municipality.
According to Habertürk’s news, a large number of police and Cevik Forces were accompanied by the municipal teams.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will complete the WADA road map in the short term"
Russian Prime Minister Assistant Vitaly Mutko said the implementation of the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to re-work will not take a long time.
"A certain stage in compliance with road map criteria has been completed, RUSADA has gained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping).
The WADA road map has been updated in this context,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister was evaluating the second part of the WADA Regulatory Compliance Roadmap, which recently published on the institution’s website, describing the criteria for RUSADA’s re-working.
According to Mutko, this does not contain anything to worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced, all will be implemented.
The results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future.”
However, a criterion mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the Russian-backed doping investigation, which was approved by the WADA, the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren allegedly conducted in Russian sports.
Mutko said, “While our anti-doping system acknowledges a failure, we are conducting the investigation.
All measures were implemented.
But there is no government program and we will not accept something that has not existed.”
Mutko's statements repeated the President of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, Vitaly Smirnov.
Speaking to the Russian broadcaster RSport in the early hours of the day, Smirnov accepted the past problems in the anti-doping organs of Russia but added: "We said in many occasions that the report contains contradictory positions and arrangements.
No one is thinking of accepting the report unconditionally,” Smirnov added.
RUSADA was suspended by the WADA to conduct doping controls in Russia after the November 2005 doping scandal.
However, international experts and under the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) supervision were allowed to plan and coordinate this June test.
In July, after a visit to the agency’s headquarters in Moscow, WADA Director Olivier Niggli RUSADA announced that he was “going in the right direction” to re-work.
100 million people watched.
The video "Come to Beşiktaş" which Beşiktaş announced the transfer to Negredo has soon reached 100 million people from 18 countries.
The video, decorated with the dialogues of Quaresma, Pepe and Negredo, was also shared on the websites of major newspapers such as Marca, L'Equipe, La Gazzetta dello Sport.
The President of Galatasaray will not return.
Former President of Galatasaray, Faruk Süren, has hardly criticized President Dursun Özbek, who is going to the capital Ankara for the transfer to Bucharest to convince Mircea Lucescu.
Here are the special statements made by the legendary president for the morning readers:
Lucescu-Uzbek talks: “We were going to finish when we went.”
The president of Galatasaray does not go empty, and his hands are empty.

The footballer comes to the president’s foot.
Of course, they meet, or kiss their hands or embrace them.
But no matter who the player is, the president does not go to his foot.
You’ll give the player 300,000 euros to the OttomanSports.

Start-ups that will help your company not be the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of the employee at the e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often unclear, unhelpful, or worse, fraudulent.
Even if anonymous, some people didn’t trust it.
Errett, who manages Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce company on hair care in San Francisco, says "There has never been consistency or objectivity."
He also called someone outside for help.
A new kind of human resource start-up is emerging to ensure companies understand how their employees feel.
These provide a software to measure and license the employee’s occupations with a specific purpose, allowing companies to conduct selective surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymous and complaint help lines, and in some cases allowing employees to report an unfairness by dismissing the senior managers and directly to the board of directors.
Jim Barnett, founder and chairman of Glint’s Redwood City start-up, which was measured by software analytics tools companies, said, “There are now vehicles that monitor your health like Strava and Fitbit, but where is your company’s Fitbit?”
Errett says that using Glint his employees better understand what they think and feel after three years.
In addition to providing the specific teams with scratch surveys and optional surveys, it offers a heat map that shows a look at which parts of the company receive the most complaints and which manager has a low likeness score; so, the reasons for these can be scratched.
To not be the next Uber, companies begin to understand that they need to be aware of the culture of their workplaces; Uber has been in a scandal since it described in a blog post published by a former employee what it clearly says is a harassment environment in which those who say what they think are punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this supervision request means a very profitable business opportunity.
According to the financial technology insights website Let's Talk Payments, the global management, regulation and compliance industry could be worth $118.7 billion by 2020.
Interest and activity for the Denver Colorado-based start-up Convercent, which has helped companies detect and prevent bad behavior, has increased among Uber’s unrecognition discussions at the beginning of this year.
Convercent has 600 customers including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently registered as a customer.
Convercent, like Glint, also allows companies to make personalized "crowd" cleansings, collect real-time secret answers and remove the heat maps of the problem areas.
It also offers a support line that can send anonymous messages where employees can report bad behavior.
If the president is accused, the complaints go directly to the board of directors.
Covercent's founder and chairman, Patrick Quinlan, said, "Kamuoyu court has captured the regulators."
Quinlan said: If a company behaves badly or is not ethical to its employees, the regulators may face expensive consequences because of consumer boycott, employee disgrace, or cases, even if they do not act.
With more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, the restaurant chain Ruby Tuesday has been using Convercent for more than a year to make employees aware of the principles and procedures and provide a way to reach the company’s center easily.
When a previous employee wanted to report a problem, he had to find a telephone number or e-mail of the company's headquarters, had an official complaint and hoped that it would be taken seriously.
James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s chief law enforcement officer, said these are mostly scary and annoying experiences, and it’s not a good way to track employees’ complaints.
But now with the company’s use of Convercent, problems that have been hidden from managers who have previously lived away from the office, city or state (such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage application) can be detected and solved faster.
Vitrano, who manages Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group, said: “I can get closer to this employment experience with a comprehensive 360-degree perspective.”
“We also protect our shareholders against business cases.”
After accounting company Arthur Andersen drowned in 2002 due to the violation of ethical values caused by the Enron scandal, companies took ethics, values and relationships with employees more seriously in 2002, Quinlan said.
But after the “social media came into itself”, companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty clothes from becoming viral.
“Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy.”
They offer both Glint and Convercent software as a service and receive repeated fees for the use of their products.
This is a business model and opportunity with the approval of risk capital investors that support both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million funding from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February and increased its total capital to $47 million.
Glint delivered $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and increased its total funding to $60 million.
Considering the nature, cultures and risk capital of companies that are linked to each other, these investments are not surprising.
Increasing research shows that today’s employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
High wages and interesting projects in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are just the minimum requirements.
Employees want to feel they are accepted, appreciated, and they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
Nina McQueen, vice president of LinkedIn’s global benefits and employment experience, using both Convercent and Glint, said: “When people are happy to be in a company, when they feel their voices are heard and their work is satisfied, they are more sincere to make that company successful.”
Investors make profits when their portfolio companies make good business; companies make good business if their employees feel honest and belong to the company.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employees’ sincerity and sense of belonging, it’s not surprising that they find support.
Having data about the employee’s commitment is important for the workplace culture experts.
But the data, if the company’s managers don’t act, becomes useless.
In fact, if a company requires feedback from its employees, it can create an expectation that the change is coming.
And if the expectation doesn’t come quickly enough or doesn’t come at all, it can cause disappointment and make employees feel disappointed.
Russell Raath, who is a consultant chairman at the corporate management company Kotter International and sees companies make a mistake of trusting too much in data collection, said: "If you will ask for 4000 suggestions, you need to be ready for 4000 speeches."
“For if you do not follow, the workers will think, ‘Do you really hear me?
Are you concerned?
And if you don’t care about me, why do you care about me?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who conducted monthly employee surveys, was able to move on the same day when a problem was in Glint.
And after gathering feedback from employees who were tired of the decision-making mechanism and the speed of communication quality, the company was able to reorganize various teams within and added communication training to solve problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company gets new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run it will become able to hold more workers in such an industry known as a high number of employees’ entry output.
Vitrona said, “If you don’t depend on creating a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people.”
"And if you lose people, you will lose customers.
And when you lose customers, you’ll lose companies.”
The NCAA lifting two exercises a day means a long day for Bruins.
It comes at 11 a.m. and a group of UCLA football players are sitting to talk on the side of the new training field within the campus of a team.
Some of them reveal their upper shaped, swallowed back from the difficulty of the first day in the training camp.
For a large part of the team, these free minutes make up a mid-day break.
After 3 hours of training, players registered in summer classes will return to their homes and work on the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings at 6.30 the next morning.
Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before returning to Tuesday: "The next three days are a torture for these men."
The NCAA's lifting of two workouts a day, organized to lift the burden on the players, actually extended their days, at least until the finals ended on Friday.
So UCLA's first three trainings were scheduled to start at 7.15 in the evening so that they will adapt to the players' already stuck program.
More than a day-to-day workout is due to the lack of two exercises; Bruins takes the start of the camp close to a week ahead than last season, and for the first time during the six seasons of Mora's summer school in Westwood.
In September, Texas A&M is scheduled to take 18 training sessions until August 20 before the official preparations for the opening of the match against Texas A&M.
While Mora added new penses to the players' intense work programme, NCAA said it supported the rule change.
Mora said, “We’re putting a huge burden on them for three or four days and that’s very challenging.”
“And they’ve passed it recently; they’re working, great children.
I think we’ll have more time when we arrive on Saturday, it’ll be really great.”
UCLA will stop their workouts when the camp is over; the luxury hotel Luskin Center, holding the side parking and the football ball nearby in the rain and closing the back of the castle with a protective network, is not an easy job when it is considered that the fields are on the view line.
Bruins players are scheduled to stay in the hotel from the beginning of this week, but Mora acknowledges that there may be a problem with the emptiness of the rooms during the season.
He said, “We will be safe.”
“It’s a real concern and it’s not too bad to think that someone will rent a room and sit there and take a training video.
If you have a video recording of a training, that’s a good thing.
But there will be our safety and upward parking will be our safety at 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I won’t worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
Facebook Increases Story Verification Power to Fight Fake News
Facebook will send more potential fake articles to third-party story verificators and show their findings under the original post; the world’s largest online social network said it was trying to fight the names as fake news on Thursday.
In a statement on the company’s website, it said they will use updated machine learning to detect potential fraud and send them to story verificators, and this will potentially show the story verification results under the original article.
Facebook is criticized by being one of the main distribution points of fake news known by many who think it affected the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has become a major political title in Europe, as the French voters have fallen into the flood of fake news before the presidential election in May and support the penalty plan if Germany fails to quickly remove hateful posts on the social media networks before the September elections.
In a separate statement on Thursday, Facebook said a test of the new story verification feature is being launched in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Facebook News Stream Product Manager Sara Su said in a blog: "In addition to seeing which stories are discussed by third-party story verificators, people want more resources about what they read and share to make information-based decisions."
He added that Facebook will continue to test the "related article" feature and will work on other changes in the news stream to reduce fake news.
Creating a cartoon: The Story of a Castle in England
In the near past, the small Scotney Castle was included in a Squeeze music clip and became a shelter for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But now, inspired by a cartoon written by a dirty-haired, historical documentary enthusiast, Yorkshire-based Jamie Rhodes, Scotney witnesses a 700-year-old glorious history from his comfortable seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent.
“I find it great to look at the handwriting of someone who has died for 300 years,” he says.
“How personal it is to keep this letter in my hand.”
A Castle in England, from Edward's era to the Middle Ages, each story records the families living in Scotney to be painted by a different artist named the United Kingdom (Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg).
This is not Rhodes’s first book based on an archive: He also wrote the 2014 Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories, a project that he unexpectedly found emotional, inspired by stories in the British Library.
"My eyes were filled with the fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for King James' fans."
“This was the footprint of his head finger.
Letters also always smell, because then you burned a fire for light.
For someone in the next 300 years, this smell feels like he’s there.
I love the archives!”
As one in love with old papers, getting the support of the National Trust and the British Council of Arts and staying in a castle for four months (‘I’ve, honestly, stayed a little beyond the need for my warm welcome.’) seems too good.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the "new" castle of the Victorian era, scanning the archives and working on many treasures and antiquities, such as centuries-long bottles and backheads, installed on the walls of the property.
Speaking with the guardians, with the gardeners, and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book, he walked around the land and remains of the ancient castle.
Then, at night, he was put to drink whisky and write.
National Trust fully accessed but the detailed date of Scotney is relatively unknown as the last heir Elizabeth Hussey was able to reach when she died in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff just began to handle the archive, and he described it as follows: “For centuries, aristocrats said, ‘Oh, throw it between the roof.’”
Diaries, letters from the days of the British Empire, maps that determine the boundaries of who has what: "You think the land disputes will be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a hush tree on which two families fought.
Let’s go out, guys!”
Some stories in the collection, including The Labourer, who left the newly built castle to participate in the Village Rebellion in 1381, use the castle as a jumping point to make a broader entrance to British history.
"In this book, The Knights' Families of the City and Sussex, there is a record that a rebellion occurred in the castle in 1380," says Rhodes.
“The village rebellion had begun around this and I thought a rebellion could be a good starting point.
Maybe these two are connected?”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle, for example the Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family, who hid a Cizvit priest for seven years during the British Massacre.
Or the Smuggler, where the 18th-century hijacker Arthut Darrell believed to have filled a taboo with stones and placed his own funeral (a revelation made when the taboo was removed from the ground years later).
Darrell's Rhodes' favourite Scotney family: "These men seemed quite regular, they always borrowed and spent money on things they couldn't meet.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy older women; I imagine them as a group of beautiful men who are willing to make money to the female varices.”
Rhodes, who ends his mission in the castle, is looking for other unique writing experiences.
In Finland's wildlife, he completed a two-week work for a cartoon about Elämänmäki, which was the field of a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, which has since been recovered by nature.
But Scotney holds a separate place in his heart.
“I’m sorry I’ve been separated,” he said.
“As if, ‘Ah, now I have to go and face the possible real life of the curse.’”
The reaction of 'Maho' to Meral Evening
Nationalist Movement Party Secretary-General Ismet Büyükataman has recently made a written statement on the claims of resignation on social media and media related to MHP.
By using the expression of the MHP from social media and "some old weapons from the corners of the Marxists" to the MHP, "the transgressive movement has been applied to games and demonstrations to prevent its existence under the MHP roof after 12 September."
The grandmother said:
“Whoever does not enjoy the historical existence of the Turkish nation, who does not draw the homeland of the Turkish nation, the record is broken, the criminal file is broken, the idea is foolish, the mind is confused, and his hands are wiped.”
“MHP Kocaeli Gölcük Provincial Organization management and members 410 people and MHP Bursa’s Yenişehir district 215 people resigned.”
250 withdrawals, 300 withdrawals are misleading with unreliable news.
In the columns of the newspapers, the lie is devastated, the deception is deepened.
The number of those who have been mentioned in these places is not the number of those who have been mentioned in these places, the number of those who have been mentioned in these places is not the number of those who have been mentioned in these places.
According to a statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Lithuania, the “reference” to the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference” of the “reference”.
The Bigkataman said, “These propaganda and campaigns aimed at creating perception against MHP will reverse.”
MHP’s Secretary-General Büyükataman, who stated that MHP is an important and indispensable actor in Turkish politics, said about the resignations:
The power of the former Marxists, whose sword increases, is not enough to destroy the place that the MHP has gained in the conscience of the Turkish people.
All the comments made, behind the practiced perception management methods, lies a dirty account.
Politics and media have put their eyes on the basis of MHP.
Those who are among us and do not do any good work and effort for the benefit of our party do not have any meaning for us to resign now.
What are those who don’t have the right to leave our party?
In their lives, MHP has not been touched well, has not shared our memories, has not understood our countries, has not participated in our struggle, even if they participate, the mind that has always stood on the side has been coaled, the heart stumbled group must find another job for them.
Those who are unable to draw the unity and integrity of the Nationalist Movement Party, the attempts to disrupt, the attempts to disrupt and the attempts to disrupt are a great effort.
And he will turn back and hit his owner.
The Nationalist Movement, despite heavy ruins, is the last castle of the Turkish people standing.
In his statement, for those he claims he targeted MHP, the “political crackers”, “political crackers”, “National movement is not without possession.”
“The roots that feed beyond the ocean will not be able to reach their purposes regardless of the cost.”
The MHP’s Bigkataman, using the expression “Tasmal traders will be crazy and will be ashes in the fire,” in his statement, ranking the opposition parties and terrorist organizations together, said in the following claims: “from the CHP to the HDP; from there to the Perinçekgill, from the PKK to the FETÖ, whoever does what they do, they will not be able to operate the right of the Turkish people to possess their own fate.”
Yesterday Turkeş"you MHP, we resisted the new tactics and games of the planners of Turkey without MHP; we fought to the end with the unhappy people who wanted the government without MHP, the parliament without MHP.
We’re going to break the games, we’re going to break the players.
"The patent of transcendence is in the MHP," Büyükataman, referring to Meral Akşener, used the following statements: "As in the film Banker Bilo, which is a former greenhouse, I will take the Maho peasants to Germany, after traveling in the truck box for days, how he left in a mountain shell of Istanbul, the subjects who followed, it is clear that he will take you to power and leave you on the edge of the hole."
This is their matter, but the only desire from these musters is that they be the new place where they go.
Kjaer signed to Seville
Kjaer signed an official contract, which was transferred from the yellow-lacivert team to Sevilla for 12.5 million euros and was the most expensive defense transfer of the Spanish team.
The Danish star will wear the number 4 in Sevilla.
It is easy for your baby families.
According to a statement from THY Press Consultancy, the national airline, which holds passengers’ flight comfort and satisfaction at the forefront and works to make them feel more comfortable during the flight, continues to develop new ideas for a perfect travel experience.
In this direction, the "baby travel kit", prepared by examining the needs of 0-2-year-old babies and their families, began to be presented to baby passengers travelling on intercontinental flights from August.
The kit, prepared with a specially designed suitcase, includes a subcutaneous replacement cover, single-use breastfeeding, peach cream, baby lotion and shampoo, newborn wet cotton handheld and breastfeeding.
Products that do not contain paraben, alcohol, paint and harmful chemicals were produced taking into account the sensitivity of the baby's skin.
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules
According to the media, President Donald Trump said there will be a new U.S. immigrant plan that changes the Green Card rules.
Legal migrants will be reduced to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work leave and family visa restrictions.
The new rules were proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both sides of the Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and do so by changing the way the US gives Green Card to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain immigration and replace the current regime.
This new application process will be useful to English-speaking candidates, those who have sufficient financial resources and the ability to benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Fenerbahçe-Sturm Graz tournament
Two years ago I didn’t find the enthusiasm and glory I didn’t see again.
A "mangal courageous" team out of Aykut Kocaman in the absences was on the ground to make an agreement "stay behind us" with their supporters.
We can bring criticism to the game, positions or performances, but I have long not seen a game that works and is looking for.
In the first match he said, but yesterday his apolets on his own shoulder; Fenerbahçe's commander in the field is now Valbuena.
The age was a problem when it was transferred, but in the words of Kocaman there was the phrase "untouchable character".
Thirty years ago, we gave the right to the name of the atomic bear to Rıza Çalımbay.
If you do it, the French player will be the best.
He was everywhere in the field, joined all the pass organizations, always took responsibility and scored a short-length enormous show.
Alper's lead-up, remaining in the second forvet position, left Sturm Graz's team "limited" in the field for a long time.
Fenerbahçe was constantly looking for a formula to overcome such a hard wall while winning the circuit without throwing the corner and closing it.
They dominate the ball but do not produce effective passes in some kind of competitive penalty field.
This image can bring an explanation of "santrfor needs", but we face a game that is hesitated to throw down to Ahmethan, the only santrfor in his hand can't put it into the position.
The team does not trust the young player or the performance needs to be a bit better.
After the score 1-1 they did not take advantage of two net chances.
It was important for them to go through the tour, but raising this fan who praised the struggle of the players to stand up as "gol" would make the night even more beautiful.
There will be 1-2 new transfers until Monday.
But the truth is that Fenerbahce’s greatest need is number 12...
We are at the forefront of a very bright and pleasant season with this style of play that carries the heart of the tribes trying to play in front.
Aykut Kocaman's machine is installing the zumbers, it takes a little more time.
They are in good physical quality.
The quality of the game will also improve.
It is clear that all footballers in the field have increased their confidence.
They need a lot of praise last night for a new page.
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
Just you think that 2017 is not even more strange, and a new report on the technological developments in the sex robot industry is coming out.
Yes .
Sex robots are a big event.
Recently, the Responsible Robot Science Institute (FRR) has published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to 10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and one of the founders of FRR, we should take their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, the shape of the breast end and the type of nail.
Mr Sharkey said about the publication of the new report: “People laugh at them, but the companies are actually sending a lot and we’ll see them even more.”
Modern sex babies have evolved into robots with silicone leather that is warm to touch, human reactions performed by artificial intelligence.
Users can also personalize their robots to suit their own blood by choosing everything from the eye color, the shape of the breast end and the type or color of the nails.
But as many robots have "personalities" enough to show a Stepford Woman innovative, this becomes even more annoying.
Modern sex babies evolved into silicone leather robots.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows users to personalize their own robots according to the character character characteristics they find attractive (e.g. attractiveness).
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, which are developed by True Companion, coming with pre-programmed personalities, giving the impression of frightening"Frijit Farrah" and the personality of "macer" including "Wild Wendy".
True Companion’s website excites: “Roxxxy Gold has a personality that fits your personality as much as possible.”
What you love is what you love is what you don’t love is what you don’t love is what you don’t love is what you don’t love.
They also have the same mood during the day as real people.
He may be sleepy, willing to talk or "in full mode".
There are many annoying facts about the rise of sex robots: not only the real human relationships are replaced, but too obedient female personality characteristics, the most thoughtful of violent calls as they approach Frijit Farah.
On the site, True Companion compares Roxxxy to a vibrator but to the one for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why don’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper within our culture, a retreat to the sexual desire by obedience, which is an optional supplement from the ideal of gender equality.
Many men will naturally not have sex robots, and although FRR draws attention to their growing popularity, they are currently in the outer corners of consumer culture.
But those who penetrate from the ends can be highly teaching about the course of the time we are living.
Many people are not strange or aggressive until the free market gives them the right to be so.
It is not a coincidence that this sophisticated sex robot appears at a time when women’s rights are threatened worldwide.
The handmaid's Tale TV series's most hairy side is the scary side, not the pictures showing all the details, the scientific bodies, or the wrapped eyes, but how realistic the image feels.
The Republic of Gilead is a sudden change but it doesn’t feel like it’s a big change now.
The objective behind these sex robots is to create as much physical similarity as possible to real women (naturally, in the ratio of porn film stars) as technically possible.
They want the creators to give a human sense when they touch and to imitate the movements of a real body.
But when the job comes to their “personalities”, robots cannot clearly represent real women.
They cannot leave their wives or leave them.
There are no activities or past stories, there is nothing to reveal their independence or to disrupt total slavery fantasy.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Or in the 2017 year: carries.
U.S. military convoy attack: dead and wounded
In the suicide attack in the province of Karabakh, Afghanistan’s capital, foreign military forces were targeted.
One NATO soldier and three civilians were killed in the explosion, five of the wounded were American soldiers on the convoy and one translator working with NATO forces.
In an official statement by the NATO support forces in Afghanistan, the NATO forces said that the suicide bombers infiltrated the home-made bomb during a joint shift mission with the Afghan National Army.
The wounded staff was to be treated at the U.S. Military Hospital at Bagram Airport.
There is no life danger for the injured.
According to the local media, the suicide bomber is a member of the Taliban.
The big Trump?
Showing Mitt Romney as a right-minded timsali
The political division that polarizes U.S. voters in the micro-scale division of families became a reality in the Trump era.
The newspapers in the U.S. around Christmas and Thanksgiving were full of how to deal with the nightmare of the relatives who voted for Trump.
We are all struggling to explode our own filtering balls.
Less speaking about it is the power of Trump to bring together the families.
I am referring to this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and is disturbed between the Republicans in our family, is visiting us this week in New York.
He reminded me that unification against a common enemy could have a strong effect.
Everyone who knows, including his Republican brother, who has been fighting over the politics of Trump’s formation in the White House for decades, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
This, of course, is a good thing at the dinner table; but it seems to me that it carries these significant risks in a broad context.
The left was revived by Trump, but the twisting effect of his presidency created the power of pushing to the right for me all.
When we’re talking about “Normalization” and Trump, we’re talking about the terrible possibility that his strange behavior may no longer shock.
There’s even more horrible long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the right-wing Republicans that are against his own standards, and they suddenly seem to be a symbol of logic.
I find myself experiencing nostalgia about the strange version of Mitt Romney’s madness these days: the dog on the car’s roof, a 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looks like), which both are really very lightweight crimes according to Trump.
When Trump goes, it is only necessary to be mindful to assess that the next Republican candidate has provided an immeasurable degree of development.
When my grandfather was in the city, we took our children to the cruises in Central Park, the largest cruises run by the New York parks department and the three best papers you can spend in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs in the central cylinder (the palm and animals that make all the strange faces returned to look with fear behind their shoulders) and the sounding music is strangely exciting.
In other words, many clichés of a city can be disappointed: the views of the high buildings begin to be boring, the horizon line begins to become familiar enough not to create too much excitement, and the reality of the city does not reach the bottom.
Thirty-five years have passed and I still couldn’t completely overcome the day when I discovered that the Swiss Cottage was not actually a Switzerland rural house (the main bar is not the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage) in the north of London.
However, jumping in Central Park is still a strangely magical experience, so that two people in the age of two, one man in the age of 11 and two women in the age of 40 can go here, and they can all have a very good time.
If I was able to note to his horse, I would give him a full note, but unfortunately no one asked.
On the other hand, I was asked to evaluate my transaction "experience" between 1 and 5 stars before I passed my credit card on a bonmarche this week.
The same thing is in the coffee shop in the corner of my street, and the option of matching the note with a 15% gift for what is purchased from the factory.
The effect of this is not only slowing down what should be a neutral shopping, but also pushing the server to become a person to an unnecessary event.
While the poor woman in Bonmarche smiled as if she was standing and apologizing, I was tired and gave her five stars to my experience of giving her credit card.
When the temperature exceeds 41 degrees, they dressed the mayons.
In Tunceli, where one of the hotest days of the season, people flown to the Munzur beaches.
From the afternoon, the young, young, old, women and men who entered the beaches on the edge of Munzur Tea, with the heat strongly suppressed, tried to protect themselves from the heat by cooling in water like ice.
Particularly in countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France and the UK, Tunceli citizens spent their holidays in their hometown instead of the Egean or Mediterranean, the beaches on the edge of Munzur Tea were filled with stones.
Suna Tosun, one of the coolers on Munzur Beach, said that he used Tunceli’s preference instead of the western ones for the holiday, “I didn’t want to spend my holiday in the west to cool my family in Munzur, it was better to stay in our own land.”
"Munzur's water like ice is not anywhere in the world, Munzur is cooling us at these temperatures."
Hasan Ulu from Germany said they prefered Munzur Tea Beach in Tunceli instead of the streets of Çeşme or Bodrum and therefore they did not regret.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius leaves the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for the treatment of the cuts in his arms that he said occurred after the prison officials said it had fallen into the cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after the prosecutors objected to the previous accidental murder decision.
In the early hours of the Lover's Day in 2013, he killed Steenkamp in his home in Pretoria, shooting several times toward the door of a toilet cabin.
Pistorius claimed that he confused his girlfriend with someone who entered the cabin during the night.
Prosecutors said they intend to reject Pistorius's six-year sentence, which they thought was very light this time.
National Prosecutor Mercii said he would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be assessed this year.
Pistorius, if the prosecutors succeed, will face an extension of his sentence to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The first chapter was blessed.
The candidates to go to Saudi Arabia with the organization of the Presidency of the Divine Affairs were greeted with prayers and tears at the Ataturk Airport External Lines Gide Terminal.

Two Bulgarians arrested in Greece for illegal camp
According to the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and cited by bTV, two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
A group of illegal campers, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia on 1 August morning.
They were left on the same day when the investigation was ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTV that the Bulgarians were later left.
The Greek authorities have strengthened their control over the free camping and still cut severe penalties on those arrested while resting in places that are not destroyed for that purpose.
It will take controls throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could punish.
We will not return to the Netherlands without finding him.
JOEY Hoffman, 22 years old, went to Turkey to travel with his two friends in early July.
Joey Hoffman, who travelled to Adana and Mersin with the car they rented, disappeared in Silifke on July 8.
His friends who came with him, despite all the calls, didn’t get to Hoffman and told his family in the Netherlands about the situation.
While the police also move to find missing tourists, his brother Robin Hoffman and his friends Angelo Durei and Jaimy Gewald went to Adana.
The Iranians dispersed.
Here, Robin Hoffman, who appeals to the police, dispersed the missing announcements to find his brother in Adana and Mersin.
Robin Hoffman said they had the latest news from his brother on July 8, saying, "We first appealed to the police in the Netherlands."
Then we went to Turkey with two friends and asked the police.
We have not received any news until now, and we have not found any clues.
“We will stay in Turkey until my brother is found.”

The last word "I think I'm dying, goodbye mom"
Among the dead in the Grenfell Tower fire in London to be 30 until now, the fire immediately calls her mother, "I don't want to die mom, it's not fair at all."
“Thank you for everything you’ve done for me, goodbye,” said Gloria Trevisan and her girlfriend.
Among the dozens of people unknown after the fire were the 26-year-old Gloria Trevisan, who was sitting on the 23rd floor of the 24-storey building, and his Italian girlfriend Marco Gottardi.
The lawyer of the Trevisan family in northern Italy, Maria Cristina Sandri, said in a statement that according to the information they obtained from British authorities, the two young people werely killed.
The lawyer, who said the youth’s families are experiencing a great suffering, also asked the journalists not to insist on getting an explanation about this.
I think I’m dead, goodbye mom.
The lawyer Sandri said Gloria was calling her mother Emanuela Trevisan by cell phone shortly after the fire came out and she was also crying when she heard the last conversations she recorded.
According to this, Gloria Trevisan talked with her mother several times over the two hours after the fire that began around 01.00 local time.
Trevisan said that he was more quiet in his first speech, "Mother, bad things happen here, the fire came out."
We are stuck, we can’t go out.
There’s a little smoke, but don’t worry, we’re waiting to be saved.
“We tried to get out by opening the door, but there was too much smoke and the elevator was not working,” he said.
The last words of Gloria Trevisan, which is increasingly concerned about the growth of the fire, are:
My whole life passes in front of my eyes.
I think I am dead.
There was a life before me; that’s not fair at all.
I don’t want to die and I want to help you financially.
I'm sorry I can't embrace you again.
Thank you for everything you did for me, goodbye mom.
I am going to heaven and I will help you from there.
This is the fault of the Italian government.
Both of them, Gloria Trevisan and her boyfriend Marco Gottardi, who graduated last year, had trouble finding a job, moved from the Veneto region in the north of the country to London in March.
Gloria Trevisan, who was able to find a job with a salary of only 300 euros in the country, soon began to work in a job in London for 1,800 pounds per month (approximately 2060 euros).
The lawyer Sandri said Gloria Trevisan's family had financial difficulties, "Gloria had gone to London to help her family."
Unfortunately, our young people are forced to leave the country to save their future and find a job.
“The government must find a solution to this problem immediately.”
Italy's drama that doesn't allow young people to work
Gloria's father, Loris Trevisan, also expressed his anger, "This is the fault of our government forcing our young people to escape abroad to find a job."
In Italy, the unemployment rate reached 12 percent, while the youth rate is 40 percent above.
On the rise of this problem, many Italian young people have begun to migrate to many European countries in the last few years, mainly in the UK.
Only last year, the number of young people forced to leave Italy due to unemployment exceeded 110,000.
The comments on the confirmation of the deaths of Gloria Trevisan and Marco Gottardi in the Italian press also stated that this was the drama of a country that could not provide jobs to young people.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can relieve IBH
Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based protein and dairy products can help relieve the symptoms of those suffering from inflammatory intestinal disease.
This untreatable health condition, which affects 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and swelling, repeated or bloodshed, weight loss and excess fatigue.
Although patients are often advised to overcome meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that protein-based amino acid triptophan helps develop immune cells that develop a resilient intestine.
The chief researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, said that immune cells circulated in the intestines so that the microbes hidden in the food do not enter the body secretly.
Cells that are capable of triggering inflammation are balanced with cells that encourage resistance by preserving sensitive tissues without damage.
If the balance moves too much towards inflammation, inflammation can be a result of intestinal disease.
In experiments, there was a kind of immune cell that promotes resistance in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their intestines.
And bacteria need triptofan, which is one of the structural stones of the protein to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna: "We have established a link between the bacterial type Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the pancreas microbiome, and the development of the cell population that promotes resilience."
The mice with more triptofan in their diet had more of these immune cells.
If the same happens to humans, L. claimed that a diet rich in reuterium and triptophan could develop a more endurance, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
The post-doctoral researcher, Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, worked on a kind of immune cell that improves resilience, while a group of experimental mice found that these cells had the same kind but that the other group, held in a different place, did not have it.
The difference was suspected that the mice had to do with intestinal microbioms, in other words, with bacteria, viruses and fungi communities that normally live in the gastrointestinal canal.
The DNA of the mice’s intestines was scansed and it was found that the mice with immune cells had six types of bacteria, but the mice without them was missing it.
The rats who were treated in a sterile environment because they were missing an intestinal microbiome and who did not develop such an immune cell were given L. reuters and immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri into a liquid and then transferred it in small amounts of this non-bacterial fluid to the unmatched immune cells taken from mice.
The immune cells have become cells that promote resilience.
The active ingredient appeared to be a side product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3-lactic acid when dissolved from the liquid.
When rats doubled the amount of triptofan in their foods, the number of cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the levels of triptofan dropped by half, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have cells that promote the same resistance as mice, and that most of us have L. reuters in the abdominal canal.
It is unknown whether triptophan side-products from L. reuteri develop in humans as in mice, but disorders in the triptophan-related genes have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease.
He said, “The development of these cells is something we probably want to encourage because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
In cases where L. reuteri is present, high levels of triptofan potentially cause the spread of this population.”
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed a 'intervention' with Nemanja Matic
After the middle-field player came out to his first match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening, Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed a "contract" with Nemanja Matic.
The £40 million transfer from Chelsea began with a 2-1 victory in Dublin before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday in the United's last pre-season match, and Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were in the position of holding in advance as they liked.
However, Matic, who was left out in the pre-season Asian tour, had a serious lack of match condition and could only take 45 minutes; Mourinho admitted that it should be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
Mourinho said, “He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his way of thinking... He’s thinking about football.”
“We’ll help him to be ready earlier.”
While Mourinho begins to shape the first 11 for the beginning of the season, like Matic, their new transfer friends Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played at the Aviva Stadium.
The Independent revealed that this week Mourinho still wants three more transfers but the club has already insisted that he has done a "extraordinary job" by performing three of his four priority transfers.
“I am grateful to the club for getting the fourth.”
“If they get four out of four, I’d be happier, but they made a lot of effort for me.”
Last year, 197 people were sent to the hospital.
According to the Swiss Social Welfare Institution, in 2005 the diagnosis of sexual dissatisfaction on one in a hundred thousand people increased to 8 in a hundred thousand in 2015.
The majority of children and young people who were unhappy with the gender they were born in the past year were transferred to Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital.
Child psychiatrist Lousise Frisen, who served in the same hospital, said that the increase could be caused by becoming a more open society, “openness in the psycho-sexual field, including questions about sexual identity, can be perceived as a general development in society.”
It is known that sexual discomfort has no connection with sexual tendency.
The drug operation in Izmir

F.T. who was trying to escape from the balcony was arrested.
It was that F.T. will be sent to court after his security proceedings.
Transfer to New Malatyaspor
From the new teams of the Super League, Evkur Yeni Malatyaspor, last season linked the wing player Turgut Doğan Shahin, who was wearing the Kasimpaşa shape.
According to a statement from the Yellow-Black club, a two-year contract was signed with the 29-year-old wing player in the framework of the transfer works.
In the statement, "A two-year contract was made with the wing player Turgut Doğan Shahin in Kasimpaşa.
Good luck to our new Malatyaspor.” the words were used.
A British inventor puts a microchip into his house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor was the first person in the country to install a microchip to open his front door, access his office, and even run his car with a hand motion.
Steven Northam, 33 years old, has transmitted the small chip between the finger and the finger, and this service is currently available to workplaces and people who want to make their lives easier with technology through its company BioTeq.
To ensure that the implant procedure can be applied according to medical standards, Winchester went to cooperation with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Hants.
The technology is similar to the microchip transmitted to cats and dogs and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company will also make changes in locks in houses and vehicles, including £300 per lock, to be chip-compatible.
This technology was installed in both the man's house and the BMW Z4 and the car was working while his hands were on the wheel.
The White House Exhibition Costs Thousands of Tax Makers
According to the military records released to TIME, the decision of the White House to throw a seafarer helicopter into the grasses in the south for an organization that promoted American production last month cost the taxpayers a figure of up to $24,000.
When he was president, the green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, also known as Marine One, was the focus of interest in the organization to present the American construction programs on July 17 in the White House.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials visited products produced in all 50 states.
The helicopter made in Connecticut was displayed side by side with a yacht from Main, a fire trucks from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.
According to the records of the responsible unit operating the helicopter, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House Harp Office requested the helicopter’s presence with a mandate (also called FRAGO) only 36 hours before it landed in the southern grass for an “unusual” organization.
The commander of HMX-1, a day before the organization, sent an e-mail to the Supreme Marine Pioneer Aviation Commander, "I just wanted to be sure that you are aware because this is an unusual high visibility organization."
The message indicated that the helicopter would come to the southern grass on July 17 at 7 p.m. for the organization at 3 p.m. and there the grass would remain until it was cleaned between 6 and 9 p.m.
Notes added that if the departure from the White House was delayed, it would require a second flight team for the return flight due to the time limits.
The security personnel of the unit stood inside the aircraft while the original flight crew was on a helicopter during the organization.
From the records provided to TIME, it is unclear whether a second flight crew is eventually needed.
Hatch law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
Records show that HMX-1 has investigated whether the organization has violated this condition.
The commander wrote, "A question we asked was whether it was infringing the Hatch Law and it was to us that it was not."
“It looks like you’re crowded,” the commander replied.
The organization "Made in America" is defined as an official organization by the White House and is not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even the official organizations are political.
In the organization, the chairman then addressed the continued efforts of the healthcare reform in the Senate and praised the government's efforts to decrease the regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is not a very new event.
The presidents need to use them to travel.
But it is unusual that these are officially requested to be used only for an opportunity to be photographed.
Trump noted that in February, when the presidential aircraft came behind the stage of the first campaign meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and the Twitter account was filled with messages about the presidential aircraft use.
White House deputy spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said: “The White House is excited about the exhibition ‘Made in America’ with products made by American workers from all 50 states.”
The HMX-1 crew frequently performs training flights in the Washington area and exercises in the southern grass to leave the U.S. president to the White House with a point shot.
Trump was in Germany for the G20 summit in early July, while he held 58 landing exercises at the HMX-1 White House.
A official said the flight for the Made in America organization was considered the crew's need for training within that month.
The unit helicopters flew an additional 11 hours on that day for "non-governmental support missions".
The White House said taxpayers did not charge any other number included in the organization.
A spokesman from Sikorksky said his companies did not participate in the arrangement of the helicopter’s exhibition in the southern grass.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and it is difficult to identify the exact expenses incurred by the organization.
But according to the Ministry of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 financial year, the Ministry of Defense’s VH-3D meeting rate is $24,340 per flight hour.
The unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the central base in Quantico Virginia to both sides.
The White House claims that the real operating cost of the helicopter is far below this rate.
Walters said, “It is very misleading to taxpayers to make a spending based on the estimates of the cost satisfaction rate.”
“These ratio estimates cover the flood costs included in staff, maintenance and annual expenses.”
According to a 2015 RAND survey, the defense ministry’s expenditure coverage rates do not include staff expenditure but include fuel, maintenance and contract expenditure.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for this organization.
Spicer said, “There is an affection to show what is done in America this week.”
“And I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security, and I think the work of hundreds of people depends on it even if there are no thousands.
And I think that we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment that many Americans, like most Americans, work to do without tiredness.
So it is, of course, appropriate to show it out.”
It’s not clear if Trump was interacting with a helicopter while traveling the southern grasses for the organization, but a firefighter took a step to the driver’s seat.
Within the White House, Trump spoke to Sikorsky's representatives about the company's products in the media and his own fleet.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” he said, “I have three of them.”

McVitie's GMB concerns about investment in Glasgow factory
A trade union is asking the managers of the cake manufacturer McVitie's to ensure that a long-term commitment to production in its factory in Glasgow is made.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent about the future of investment in the Tollcross region.
In addition to other products, more than 500 people work in the factory where Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits are produced.
McVitie’s owner Pladis said they have invested more than 5 million pounds in the region in the last few years.
If there is a change in their operations, the workers and trade union representatives will be "first informed".
In a letter to the company’s facility manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie’s to “release their concerns that there is no funding for the modernization of production bands.”
GMB’s senior organizer, Drew Duffy, said: “It is deeply concerned that our members are not able to see a clarity on the business needs and the investment plan for Tollcross’s future from Tesis’s chief executive.
Families have been working here for generations and the workforce is gathered intensely in the local community and in Glasgow and its suburbs, which are the critical basis for sufficient employment in a area with high unemployment and social disability.
From the point of view of business, wages and well-being, against Brexit conditions, increasing survival costs and chronic production decline, a four-head production in the eastern end of Glasgow McVitie's is urgently needed."
A spokeswoman from Pladis said: "Tollcross's facility manager GMB received a letter from Scotland yesterday and the company will respond directly because we appreciate our commitment to workers and trade union representatives.
Two months ago at Tollcross, together with staff and GMB representatives, we held a regular meeting where several issues were clearly discussed.
Then we told our employees, like all companies working in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic environment, that we are continuously reviewing our operations to remain competitive, which applies to all our business and facilities.
He added: “In recent years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in Tollcross facilities, especially in production bands and operational improvements.
We fully recognize Tollcross’s heritage as a production facility, and if any changes occur in our facility operations, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know.”
Necip and Utku 4 years in Beşiktaş
The club has extended the contract of Necip Uysal and Utku Yuvakuran to four years.
In the section on the website of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) with data related to footballers, it was seen that Beşiktaş has extended its contract with two players until 31 May 2021.
Necip, who grew up in the infrastructure of the black and white team and made his first professional contract on June 19, 2008, began to form in the 2009-2010 season.
The team captain, born in 1991, played in a total of 254 official matches with the Beşiktaş form.
The TFF website also contains the information that Beşiktaş has signed a contract with him until 31 May 2021 by taking the bonservative of the kaleci Utku Yuvakuran, which was included in the staff as a lease last season.
The information that Utku was removed from the status of temporary transfer from 1 August 2017 and its license was renewed on 2 August is visible on the website.
Utku Yuvakuran played more in the 21 Years Six League in Beşiktaş, where he rented last season.
The young castler, with black-white form, only participated in 2 Turkish Cup matches.
PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's departure three years ago?
The La Liga side may have regretted his interest in Marco Verratti.
Paris Saint-Germain will not give up Neymar's pursuit after proposing a £189 million release item, but have they warned Barcelona to steal the world record three years ago?
As the Ligue 1 team was ready to break the world transfer record more than twice the previous amount Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United last season for £89 million, the sensational offer moved the summer transfer period.
With PSG offering a weekly wage of £500,000 after taxes, it shows that when the transfer is completed, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and also the most profitable professional athlete.
Although a source close to the Catalan administration has insisted that since the arrival of Santos in 2013, the club has always done its best to look at him, it is known that Barcelona is angry about the style of the proposal and the attempt of Neymar to leave.
So, was the football world warned about this scene three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing to Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi made a strong warning to all clubs who wanted to signing to one of PSG's best players.
Al-Khelaifi said, “I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we’ll be against them, we’ll get in touch with their players.”
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to sign to one of our players, they will tolerate their results.”
The Spanish club Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line in the beginning of this summer, expressing interest in PSG's middle-field player Marco Verratti.
PSG said it will not allow the Italian to leave under any conditions, and Barcelona also feels the reflection of this interest by losing Neymar from its greatest values.
