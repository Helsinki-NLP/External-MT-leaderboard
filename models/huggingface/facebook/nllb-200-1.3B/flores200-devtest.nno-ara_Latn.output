Oliver Sacks, in his treatise The President's Speech, indicated how humans who are not able to understand speech as a result of brain damage, are nevertheless able to assess the frimota correctly.
He even suggests that such definitions for interpreting human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two reserves of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reserve of expressed variation.
Segregering and recombination moves the variation back and forth between the two with each generation.

As the knowledge of Greek diminished, the West was torn away from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.

Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-propelled oscillation generators that will continue with periods where they go in free cycles, even when there is no external signal to place.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments where they either marked the DNA in the case of radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the case of radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the attacked genetic material is, and whether the attacked cells are kimbane cells.
Only mutations in kimbane cells can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

In this dynamic transport, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars. In this dynamic transport, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Research now suggests that this massive CO2-economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has supported man's evolution the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
Inland, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges as collapsing. You rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges as collapsing.
Why do transportation systems cause so many complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something more basic behind it?

The majority of insects have an advantage in that they can fold their wings backwards along the body.
This gives them more small places to choose from when they are hiding from predators.
The only insects today that can't fold in the wings, are eye-stickers and dayflies.

content theories are centered around finding out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as we get older.
Theories look at what's with certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what's in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of needs hierarchy and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.

on the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who becomes a stranger, who feels he or she has to change everything the group has ever done, and make it their own.

This behavior often results in conflicts between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams have the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtuelle groupmembers often function as contactpoint for the nearest physical group. Virtuelle groupmembers often function as contactpoint for the nearest physical group.
They often govern themselves more on their own than conventional group members because their groups often meet according to varying time zones, something that may not be met with understanding by the local leadership.
