Fire in French chemical plant extinguished
The fire at a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was extinguished, the Normandy prefecture said on Friday. The fire broke out on Thursday night. No one was injured in the incident. The fire department was in operation with about 200 fire trucks.
The fire could be stopped
Anrainer was told not to leave their homes. Buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday. The chemical plant on the Seine River is producing lubricant additives. The factory is owned by the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called Seveso Directive of the EU, which imposes particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical plant has been making headlines in the past - for example, when a leak in 2013 removed methane from the gas and the environment smelled like rotten eggs.
Woman quits her job to look for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman in Washington searched for her missing dog - and she quit her job for it. Seven-year-old Border Collie had run away from her hotel room while on a short vacation in Montana.
"It was terrible. I got sick", Carole King told Daily Inter Lake. "You and your husband left Katie in the hotel room while they were going out to dinner. When they returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Thunder had put the dog in a panic.
Hoping that Katie might still be staying at the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says, 'She left about four, four and a half hours ago,'" Carole King recalls to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic front door opened, Katie ran out immediately.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their beloved dog. But days went by. "I never gave up. I never lost hope", Carole King told the Daily Inter Lake, who quit her job as a postal worker to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears were flowing"
Fifty-seven days after Katie disappeared, Carole King got a call: a man reported Katie in his yard. But when King arrived, Katie was already gone. She looked around the neighborhood and suddenly her dog was standing under a tree. "I just hugged her. I didn't want to let her go", King recalled in the Daily Inter Lake. "Tears were flowing. People were in their cars, getting out and hugging us.
Losses in the German army: machine guns disappear without a trace
The following information is provided for in the Annex to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013:
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the Bundeswehr has lost numerous weapons and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, including three machine guns.
The Bundeswehr is constantly losing weapons and ammunition - many of them so far without trace. Since the beginning of 2014, the troop has recorded the loss of 39 weapons, 39 pieces of ammunition and almost 20,000 rounds of ammunition.
According to the paper from the Office of the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun and 3474 shot ammunition have been recovered so far.
The extent of the losses in weapons and ammunition in the Bundeswehr was "intimidating", said Martina Renner, a left-wing Bundestag member. This was all the more true since little had been found during the investigation. The left-wing politician spoke of a "dark balance sheet". Renner criticised that it was not recognizable on the list whether the ammunition also included in the missing ammunition was found in connection with the investigation against Franco A. the suspected German army officer.
Oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves Iranian port
More than two months after being seized by Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker Stena Impero left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. According to ship observation data from Refinitiv, the tanker set off and left the Iranian port.
The tanker was actually released by the Iranian government on Monday, but it remained in Iranian waters for the first time.
The "Stena Impero" was launched by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in the Strait of Hormuz on 19 July on charges of breaching security regulations, but it was suspected that Iran was responding to the controversial temporary capture of an Iranian oil tanker off the British-owned Gibraltar.
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the global oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have escalated tremendously in recent months.
Merkel pays tribute to the courage of the people in the peaceful revolution
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has appreciated the commitment of the people of the GDR who took to the streets 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the autumn of 1989, brave citizens had shaken the GDR regime at the time, Merkel said at a party of the Thuringia CDU faction on the upcoming day of German unity in Erfurt.
Musk is aiming for a record-breaking delivery.
Tesla's quarter may hold a record, despite a supply boom, but the electric car company has recently seen losses.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers. "We have a chance to hit our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand is so high that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said, and the challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, so Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of business with a surge of over six percent, and the price hasn't been up that strong in almost four months, and in the second quarter, Tesla delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its all-time high.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, six-digit numbers must be produced in the current and next quarter. Mostly the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses recently.
Mystery solved: That's why we can't get itch ourselves
A kind of brake in the brain prevents people from getting themselves tickled, scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin found with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening, and that progress had also been made on why children resist tickling so fiercely, only to demand more.
Finally, it has also been shown that the mere presence of a tickling hand triggers laughter even before touch, because of a deep layer in the brain that triggers laughter even when it is expected to tickle.
According to the data, previous research has shown that rats respond with "laughter" in the ultrasonic range when bitten by humans. This "laughter" is transmitted through the part of the cerebral cortex that serves as the central processing of haptic perception.
Laughter is suppressed by self-touching
It was previously thought that the brain could distinguish between self-touching and touching by others - hence, humans cannot tickle themselves. But the Berlin researchers found that in the experiments on rats, laughter and the activity of the relevant area of the cerebral cortex are suppressed during self-touching. This is also true when living things clean themselves. During the contact and the tickling by the scientists, the activity in the brain and the impulse to laugh have been enhanced.
But if the self-touch and the touch of others were happening at the same time, laughter was also suppressed, which suggests that the rat's brain just couldn't tell the difference between self-touch and other people's touch.
The rats were also trained to gnaw themselves, and they sometimes abandoned this initiation in the experiment prematurely, showing flight or fear-stricken behavior, which is similar to that of children, and the ambivalence of gnawing is a behavior response that is similar in rats and humans.
Disaster prevented: Large fire at French chemical plant extinguished
The French authorities have confirmed that the fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been extinguished, the French news agency AFP reported on Friday.
The authorities said no hazardous substances had been produced, and the samples taken were not cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning.
Schools and kindergartens have been closed
Residents were urged not to leave their homes, buildings within 500 metres were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
The factory is owned by the Lubrizol company of US billionaire Warren Buffett
The plant, which is owned by the US billionaire Warren Buffett's Lubrizol company, is subject to the EU's Seveso Directive, which requires particularly strict safety requirements.
The chemical plant has made headlines in the past - for example, when a leak in 2013 removed methane from the gas and the environment smelled of rotten eggs.
Brexit: Johnson criticized by his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at the first sitting of Parliament after the suspension of the mandatory leave on Wednesday evening.The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country out of the EU on 31 October without an agreement if Brussels does not respond to his demands for changes to the Brexit agreement.
Speaking of Cox, who had campaigned for Britain to remain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honour Jo Cox's memory and reunite this country is to leave the EU". Cox was murdered by a right-wing extremist during the 2016 referendum campaign.
A memorial to the Oslo and Utöya attacks is revealed
More than eight years after the Oslo and Utöya attacks, with 77 dead, a memorial to the victims will be unveiled in Norway on Saturday. The Iron Roses (German: the Iron Roses) monument consists of around 1,000 iron roses. They recall the roses laid by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the Oslo Cathedral attacks.
The project by artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is to be unveiled at the same location - the roses were forged by people from all over the world, including survivors and victims' relatives.
On 22 July 2011, right-wing terrorist Anders Behring Breivik first detonated a car bomb in the Oslo government district and then on Utöya Island, killing dozens of participants in a youth camp of the Social Democratic Workers Party.
Iran releases British tankers
The UN General Debate did not solve the Iran conflict. But now there is a problem less. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" detained in Iran could be thrown back into the sea. It could be a puzzle piece in Iranian President Rouhani's peace plan.
The British oil tanker Stena Impero, which has been trapped in the Strait of Hormuz in Iran since mid-July, has returned to international waters, and after being cleared by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, according to Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the crew is now heading to Dubai for medical examinations, among other things, said Erik Hånell, the shipping company's chief.
The Foreign Office in London called the seizure of the vessel illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to undermine the freedom of the seas. We are working with our international partners to maintain maritime law and international law", it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards arrested the tanker on 19 July on charges of violating the Persian Gulf maritime law. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released in early September. The remaining 16 crew members are doing well, Hånell said. They have been acting professionally in the face of the difficult and exhausting situation over the past ten weeks.
The British government suspected that the "Stena Impero" was a reaction to a similar incident in British Gibraltar, where a supertanker with Iranian oil, supposedly for Syria, had been chained in early July. The delivery was allegedly in violation of EU sanctions against the warring country of Syria.
Iran spoke of "piracy" and threatened consequences. In mid-August, the Adrian Darya-1 was finally released. London vehemently rejected the suspicions that it was a trade-off to free the "Stena Impero".
The Strait of Hormuz is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Much of the world's oil exports are shipped through the Strait. Tensions in the region have escalated immensely in recent months.
The US has been pushing the Iranian leadership to build nuclear weapons, which Iran denies. The US withdrew from the international nuclear agreement in 2018 to prevent Iran from building a nuclear bomb and end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has been pressuring the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country to force a stricter and extended agreement in other areas. Iran has been resisting the pressure so far.
Because of the stena impero dispute and other incidents involving tankers in the Persian Gulf and oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition to provide military protection to the trading vessels in the region.
The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani presented a plan for security and peace on the Strait of Hormuz to the UN General Assembly in New York.With the 'Coalition of Hope' initiative for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of shipping in the Persian Gulf together with the Arab Gulf states and without foreign protecting powers.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policies.
India is actually destined to be the "win-win" country. Given the tariffs imposed by US President Donald Trump on Chinese manufacturers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to redistribute. The finance chiefs of Asian companies considering moving their production from China to another country cite India as one of the preferred alternatives in a UBS survey. This, of course, has to do not only with the uncertainties of Chinese-American trade law. With a huge pool of young workers and an India's internal market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have been created to play a significant role in the wider global production chain.
But now India itself has come under Trump's spotlight. From the White House's derogatory title of "Kingdom of Customs", America has stripped the emerging market of trade concessions for 2,000 products in early June. The US accuses India of prohibitive tariffs and demands better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
The world map of trade wars shows that the Indian mills are only a side-by-side. In addition, the United States views the world's largest democracy through its security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington link concerns about China's claims to power in the South Indian Ocean. Against this background, a wave of American tariffs on India is unlikely to be imposed.
The problem is elsewhere: the empirically reinforced thesis that open markets accelerate economic development is a difficult one in the socialist Republic of India. Even under Modi. His reform drive is mainly aimed at the bureaucratic madness that has suffocated every entrepreneurial spirit in the multinational state for too long. Companies are now getting building permits faster. They are benefiting from better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more robust insolvency and bankruptcy law creates the conditions for the faster liquidation of failed companies with high debt.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From an economic perspective, India has improved a lot in the first five years of Modi. But this is not the case in trade policy.
In the West, Modi is a fan of the energetic reformer who is radically renewing his country economically. This impression is not least due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows all too well what vocabulary Western managers like. But in essence, the India First advocate never turned away from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to dismantle anachronistic processes and thus fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive by shutting down their industries are among the traditionalists of the national Bharati Janata Party and complain about this short-sighted policy.
The funeral of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French president Jacques Chirac is scheduled to be buried in Paris next week, according to a report.The former head of state will be buried on Monday at Montparnasse Cemetery in the south of the French capital, AFP news agency reported, citing the Chiracs family.The funeral will take place in close family circles.
Taking on the competition: Dabo is the first secret World Championships champion
The world's top was already in the goal when heartwarming scenes were played in the down-cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5,000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba began to fluctuate dangerously. He could barely stand on his feet 300 meters before the goal, running in an unhealthy bent posture, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly snapped him and dragged him to the finish in support of the last half of the stadium round. The forces were still enough for both of them to stop the clock running with the aim.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing", Dabo said after the Mixed Zone race, when he unexpectedly caught the attention of the gathered journalists. Shy, he started off not wanting to talk about his heroic feat at all. After all, he wanted to set his personal best time and when he realized that this would be difficult, he just wanted to help a fellow sufferer.
He did it that evening with a lot of pressure - and much more intensity than he thought, because this feat will be remembered. Since Dabo even let his rival Busby finish and took last place voluntarily - by the way, five minutes after the Ethiopian Selemon Barega, who won this preliminary.
The first time that the European Union was able to reach the final was in the second half of the year, when the European Union was able to reach the final of the European Championships in the first half of the year.
Millionaire Mass: Egyptians preparing for a wild protest day
In Egypt, security measures have been stepped up in anticipation of possible government-critical protests, with police presence in central Cairo on Friday, several metro stations closed, and roads around Tahrir Square blocked.
In recent days, police have stepped up their road controls and searched pedestrian phones for news and photos related to the protests, with hundreds arrested, according to two NGOs.
Opponents of Al-Sisi
Last weekend, protests were held in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, with hundreds of participants, against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who has been accused of corruption and mismanagement by critics. There had been no such open protest against the political leadership in Egypt for years. The Egyptian contractor and actor Mohammed Ali, who was living in exile in Spain and who launched the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, called for a "million-million march" in central places in the country on Friday. Ali is calling for an "ex-people revolution". The man is not a good Egyptian for most young people, even though he is "good because he has created millions of messages for his army, but he has succeeded in coming to the embassy.
The number of arrests in connection with the protests continued to rise, according to two groups of observers.The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) counted more than 1,570 arrests as of Friday.The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and Human Rights Watch (HRW) reported more than 2,000 arrests.
Arbitrary arrests
Many people were "arrested arbitrarily" "only because they were 'in the wrong place at the wrong time'", HRW said, citing lawyers for detainees. The charges against the detainees range from "spreading false information" to membership in a "terrorist association", according to their lawyers.
Human Rights Watch also criticized the censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to curb further protests against Sisi.
Online retailers: shippers should be able to donate returns more easily
For online retailers, many returned packages are lost goods, and about 20 million returns end up in the trash.
The Treasury has shown online retailers like Amazon and Zalando a way to donate returned products instead of destroying them.
While companies cannot be exempted from the sales tax on donations in kind, the ministry explained to a question from the Green Party group, which the newspapers of the Sponge Media Group reported on Friday, that traders could consider the market value of unsold returns to be so low that they would have to pay no or little sales tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that when people order online, they send back every sixth package. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - were then thrown into the trash.
The Green Group's head, Katrin Göring-Eckardt, urged Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify by a decree that companies can evaluate non-marketable products accordingly and donate to non-profit organisations free of charge.
Banksy's art for auction: There's never been a better time to sell this painting
Streetart star Banksy's famous work, "Devolved Parliament", is due to be auctioned off soon.
Banksy's work, according to Branczik, "stresses the retrospective of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy into animal and tribal basic care". The painting is to be on display at Sotheby's in the UK capital from Saturday until it is auctioned off on 3 October.
The work was first exhibited in 2009 at the Bristol Museum in the southwest of the UK, where Banksy lives. This year the artist had re-exhibited the painting - concurrently with the original Brexit date of 29 March.
The picture could change hands for a million dollars.
Last Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had a hard-fought exchange with the opposition at the first sitting of the House of Commons after the Supreme Court lifted a suspension imposed by Johnson.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, has intervened in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the south-east of England, he painted a picture of a man smashing a star of the European flag with a chisel. The work is seen daily by thousands of truck drivers and other visitors entering the UK.
Brexit debate is like a walk in the park
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit opponents in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top adviser. Compared to the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", Dominic Cummings said at a book launch on Friday.
Johnson had been harshly attacking Brexit opponents in parliament in recent days, accusing them of "treason" to the people, among other things, and calling accusations that he could endanger the MPs by making them targets of death threats.
Cummings said the only way to restore peace was if the MPs finally respected the decision of the British to leave the EU. It is not surprising that people were upset that Britain still did not leave the EU three years after the referendum.
On Friday, even the Anglican bishops called for restraint in view of the heated atmosphere. "We should speak with respect to one another", said a statement. "And we should listen".
Pakistan Prime Minister Khan calls for UN intervention in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, in his first appearance before the UN General Assembly, once again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict.
Otherwise, another war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said at the UN General Debate in New York on Friday. "If things go badly, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst". The United Nations would have a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented this".
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from British colonial rule in 1947, two of them around the divided Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers each control part of Kashmir, another part belongs to China.
Not even a bottle of water
Protesters in Cairo are demanding the overthrow of Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The government is responding to the current protests in Egypt with a hard hand, firing sharp shots at the population, with over 2,000 prisoners joining the 60,000 political prisoners already held there. Protests in Egypt have never been safe.
But one of the causes of the protests in 2011 was the poor economic situation. Poverty, hopelessness and the feeling of being suffocated by one's own government drove millions into the streets. And this is a problem that even the regime of al-Sisi cannot handle, no matter how hard it is to deal with opponents.
Today, one in three Egyptians lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is 10 percent. Whoever wants to buy a bottle of water in a supermarket must decide who to finance: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for oppression but also the biggest economic actor. The military builds roads, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was before el-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes, the Egyptian people have a lot of experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. It becomes critical whenever large parts of the population have trouble getting a bottle of water at all.
Tüv checks at the terminal: BER Head: No more showstoppers for the capital airport
Two months have passed since the complex plant linkage was tested to ensure that BER's fire protection system works in sync with each other.
Following extensive Tüv tests at the terminal of the future capital airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year, Supervisory Board Chairman Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the control board.
Airport manager Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there were still flaws in the terminal to be worked out. "We have many details, but we don't have a real showstopper". He assured that the schedule until commissioning still contained buffers.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve is not likely to be too large.The contract notice is now to be submitted to the Office of Construction during the first quarter of 2020, which was planned for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of electricity cable deficiencies remain to be fixed, and Tüv intends to examine them by February. "In order to create the conditions for the start of operations, there is a need to continue to work intensively to address the deficiencies", it said in a written communication.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases the evidence was lacking, less so new cables, and that there was no approval for all the cables hanging on the cable lines, which the airport manager expects to be available by the end of the year.
The problem was that the project had already been in another crisis three years ago. This time it was about smoke shutters that would shut down like a canvas in case of fire so that the smoke would not spread. They are going too far down. 36 engines must be replaced. Then there should be new experiments with hot gas smoke at the beginning of the year.
The airport was originally scheduled to open in 2011, but costs have increased from two billion in 2006 to an estimated 6.5 billion euros for the opening next year.
Since passenger numbers in Berlin have increased significantly since then, the authorities are planning to expand the airport, which is why it is due to be announced at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by the chairman of the board, Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managing directors. Finance chief Heike Fölster will move to Deutsche Bahn at the end of the year, and chief of staff Manfred Bobke-von Camen will retire next year, as Bretschneider said.
Chemnitz: Drug vending machines blown up - police arrest man
He needed money for drugs and he blew up a lot of vending machines in Chemnitz, now the perpetrator is in jail!
In the past two years, the number of cigarette and parking ticket machines blown up in Chemnitz and the region has increased sharply, causing a million dollars in damage.
Police arrested a 33-year-old German man in Chemnitz after two explosions at the end of May on Bürgerstraße and Furtherstraße.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigation into the bombing of Tate unit with a particularly serious case of theft, carried out by the Chemnitz Criminal Police, not only this suspicion against the 33-year-old was confirmed".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old chemist now confessed to a total of eight acts.
The police spokesman: "It appears that he financed his drug addiction with the loot". The bomber had detonated parking tickets on Bürgerstraße four times between August 20, 2018 and May 31, 2019.
The total damage is at least EUR 60 000!
The bomber is now under investigation and the police investigation against him continues.
He was also believed to be responsible for further car bombings in Chemnitz and adjacent counties.
AUA takes over Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reversing its strategy for Vienna Airport.Amid a price battle with low-cost airlines such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, Lufthansa subsidiary AUA is taking over "commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", a spokesman for Austrian Airlines told APA on Friday.
The Vienna base of Lufthansa-Billigig Airline Eurowings is thus de facto dissolved. Of the seven Eurowings aircraft currently in operation, four remain in Vienna. The AUA will take over the "wet base" from January 2020, including Eurowings personnel.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA hub and network planning, the spokesman explained.Flight times will be aligned with connecting flights.
According to AviationNetOnline, Eurowings is still operating in Vienna as a production company for the sister AUA group, serving Barcelona and Rome, among others, with AUA flight numbers but mainly with Eurowings equipment.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the marketing of certain products and services for the purposes of the marketing of such products.
Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary's campaign slogan that Lauda will have overtaken the AUA in five years, AUA chairman Andreas Otto responded on Friday: "We will remain number one in the location, in five, six or ten years".
Queen granddaughter Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: When they were children, the cousins were best friends. Now the last of the four is getting married.
Wonderful news from the British royal family: During the Italian holidays earlier this month, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, 34, is said to have stopped by his girlfriend Princess Beatrice, 31, the palace announced on Thursday.
"We are extremely excited to announce our engagement. We are both so excited to start this adventure together and can hardly wait to actually be married", the couple, who have been together since October 2018, British media reports said in the official statement.
And he continued, "We share so many similar interests and values, and we know that this will help us a lot in the years to come, full of love and happiness".
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official engagement photos were taken by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and posted on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding is scheduled for 2020. More information on the date, place and everything else will be released by the palace in the coming months.
But it is certain that the wedding of the ninth in the British line of succession and the real estate mogul will be a similarly large party to Eugenie's wedding on October 12, 2018 to Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study of causes of heart disease
Smoking, being overweight, eating unhealthy foods -- there are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. But what really triggers heart failure or stroke?
By analysing the genetic makeup of 9,000 people, Hamburg and Switzerland scientists want to find out more about the causes of cardiovascular disease.
The research project is the largest of its kind in the German-speaking area, the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) announced on Friday. The Kühne Foundation is funding the project with 12.5 million euros.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy diets are among the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Genetic factors determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is not well understood, he said. Now scientists want to compare the complete genetic makeup of 8,000 healthy people with that of 1,000 former patients at the UCLA University's cardiovascular center.
The clinic said that more than 4,000 of the 20,000 genes involved in the study are now known to cause disease-causing changes in the DNA, or mutations, and that about 200 are added each year.
The five-year project aims to develop new options for prevention, detection and treatment of heart rhythm disorders, heart failure and heart attacks, and could also be useful in researching other diseases, says Stefan Blankenberg, director of the University's Heart and Vascular Centre.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed the strong desire to use the data to investigate other diseases.The Foundation's clinic in Davos has so far mainly treated allergies.
The bio-samples of healthy participants come from Hamburgers who are also participating in the Hamburg City Health Study, which the clinic says is the largest local health study in the world with 45,000 participants. Genetic encryption is strictly enforced to protect anonymized data, the scientists assured.
The genetic code of a human being can be deciphered within 24 hours, according to the UKE. The net cost is 1300 euros. The first gene sequencing worldwide, whose results were published in 2001, cost several hundred million euros. The study is expected to begin on 1 October, and all 9000 samples should be analyzed by the end of 2020.
Nigerian police release hundreds of abused boys
In Nigeria, police have freed more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Koran school. According to reports from residents, security forces searched the school in the northern Nigerian city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, some of them still underage, police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said. "The victims were abused, some of them claiming to have been raped by their teachers", Sabo said.
The boys were detained under the pretext of being taught the Quran and "improved". In fact, the defendants were detained by their teachers under "the most degrading and inhuman conditions", Sabo said.
The school has been in existence for about ten years, residents said, alerting authorities to repeated irregularities in the facility, parents were shocked when they were told about the conditions at the school, Sabo said, and they had no idea their children were suffering, and the operator and six staff were arrested, police said.
In the predominantly Muslim north of Nigeria, there are many private Quran schools that replace the often-deficient state institutions. People in the region are frequently attacked by armed gangs. According to the UN Refugee Agency, over 40,000 people have fled the border to neighboring Niger in the past ten months.
Chained and tortured: Nigerian police release 400 children from school
"Many of them were chained and some had visible injuries that suggested torture", said Yakubu Sabo, police spokesman in Kaduna City.
The children were found there on Thursday after a tip from an Islamic school, where conditions were "inhumane".
The children, all boys, were held in their schools as slaves and chained, some sexually abused, and television pictures showed weakened and injured students in a markedly poor health.
World Cup: further allegations after Messi and Klopps's death
Football "signature not valid"
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe awarded
With a gala in Milan, FIFA will award the best player, best player and best coach of the year, which will be the sixth honour for Lionel Messi and a record.
After the Nicaraguan captain declared that he never voted in the World Cup, accusations were made against FIFA from other countries.
The Commission has also been concerned about the need to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the European Union and the objectives of the European Union.
But after the Nicaraguan captain complained that he did not vote at all, further inconsistencies have now emerged: Egypt complains that the voices of national coach Hossam El-Badry and captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account.
FIFA apologises for the "signature of the ballot papers in capital letters and therefore not valid".
Sudanese coach also surprised
The Sudanese Federation of Football Associations (FIFA) has also issued a statement saying that the vote was not as successful as it was: with Lionel Messi at number one, Virgil van Dijk at number two and Sadio Mané at number three.
The Nicaraguan captain Juan Barrera also made accusations: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All statements about my vote are wrong, thank you", he wrote.
The association now received the message on Friday: "Yes, but it was not intended. The completed ballot papers were "erroneously" given the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan national team, it was said in a statement from the association.
The other cases are now being investigated by FIFA, but the agency stresses that the election process was overseen externally by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers.
Ukraine: high-ranking Republicans speak out for an official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans have openly vowed to an official investigation against U.S. President and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important", said Republican Governor of the U.S. state of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established". He wants to know more about the whistleblower affair before action is taken.
Scott said he was not surprised by the revelations, which showed that Trump had repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Vladimir Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair, with few complaining about it. Scott's comments are now a first sign of this in Trump's party. The moderate governor of Virginia has already repeatedly opposed Trump's policies, such as easing environmental laws and tightening immigration laws.
As another high-ranking Republican, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker spoke out for the investigation. "It's a deeply disturbing situation", Baker said. "The right course of action and responsibility for Congress now is to investigate the matter and get to the bottom of it".
Scott and Baker formally did not comment on the Trump case, which will be decided in Congress, as governors of the United States. Their statements are therefore primarily symbolic. Nevertheless, early Republican senators have also been critical of the situation. Mitt Romney, representing Utah in the second chamber of Congress, said the case was "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing".
The case could lead to impeachment proceedings against Trump, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced will be investigated, accusing him of abusing power to influence foreign policy for their own political gain.
The Democratic Party's impeachment process is not scheduled, and the Democrats, with their majority in the House of Representatives, could push for impeachment, but the decision to remove the incumbent is made in the Senate, where Trump's Republicans have a majority.
Were there any torturers on board of Racket's Sea Watch?
Three men have been arrested in Sicily for allegedly raping and murdering in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rackete (31) was arrested in June after she had illegally steered the port of Lampedusa with the rescue ship Sea Watch 3 and 53 Libyan refugees aboard.
Now, new serious accusations against rockets are coming out, suggesting that three men accused of torture in Libyan refugee camps may have arrived in Italy with the "Sea-Watch 3" after migrants identified their tormentors in Italy. "We cannot rule this out, but we do not have any information", said Ruben Neugebauer, spokesman for the German press agency.
Police said in mid-September that the suspects had raped, tortured and even murdered in the North African country, including Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea and the two Egyptians Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24).
NGOs and aid organisations are now pointing out that they cannot know exactly who is coming on the ships. "We cannot scan who the people are. They come without passports", Neugebauer said. Torture is one of the main reasons why people are fleeing Libya. It is therefore quite likely that offenders are also on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this is followed up".
Italy's former justice minister, Matteo Salvini, has called for an immediate apology from Rackete, who is still under investigation in Italy for aiding illegal immigration.
Musk is trying to break Tesla's record for deliveries.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has given his electric car company a strong boost in the stock market with the prospect of new record numbers.
"We have a chance to hit our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries", Musk wrote in an email to Tesla employees published by the industry blog Electrek.
The demand is so high that Tesla could place 110,000 orders, Musk's circular said, and the challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, so Tesla needs to offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked this: Tesla's shares went out of business with a surge of over six percent, and the price hasn't been up that strong in almost four months, and in the second quarter, Tesla delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its all-time high.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, he needs to produce six-digit numbers in the current and next quarter. Mostly the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there have been losses lately.
US budget dispute: renew only one bridge financing
The new fiscal year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget, and the Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase spending ceilings for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the United States is once again facing a new fiscal year that begins on October 1. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and has decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until November 21.
Shutdown turned off
The Federal Administration is now provisionally financed at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the fiscal year ending on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress has not been able to agree on the 12 spending laws in time to allocate the funds to the various departments and authorities.
The Democrats have completed 10 of the 12 bills in the House of Representatives, where they have a majority, but the spending bills reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance of winning in the Republican-dominated Senate.
The Democrats are dissatisfied with the wall's construction plans and funding, which are actually for other military projects. The debate over the wall escalated in December 2018 and led to a 35-day shutdown.
The spirits are separated at the wall
It is not clear how the parties intend to approach this issue at present.More likely than agreement on all 12 spending laws over the next seven weeks, an extension of transitional financing beyond 21 November is also likely.
In view of the continued failure of the Congress to agree on the 12 spending laws in time and the associated risk of a shutdown, ideas for automating the process are gaining popularity.
France allows artificial fertilization for lesbians and singles
In France, artificial insemination is to be open to single women and lesbians in the future: the Paris National Assembly voted by a large majority in favour of a government bill allowing all women to use in vitro fertilization, which would significantly increase the demand for anonymous sperm donations.
The proposal still needs the approval of the Senate. In the three-day emotional debate, critics on the right had warned that in the future many "children without a father" could grow up.
The new regulation is the core component of a bioethics law that Health Minister Agnès Buzyn has defended as a "opportunity" for society, and it represents the modern family, where there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents.
Further prohibited fertilization with sperm from dead husband
The National Assembly, however, rejected by a narrow majority an amendment to allow widows to access the semen of their dead husbands for artificial insemination. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, artificial insemination is allowed "postmortem". In Germany, there have been cases in the past where women have complained in vain about the issue of the sperm of a deceased person.
Many MPs from President Emmanuel Macron's ruling La République en Marche (The Republic in Movement) party and opposition MPs had opposed artificial insemination with the sperm of the deceased partner, stressing that a widow is "double mourning" if her wish for a child is not fulfilled by the death of her husband.
The initiators of the now failed amendment consider it unfair that a widow may be fertilized with the semen of a stranger in the future but not with her own partner.
So far, artificial insemination in France is only allowed to heterosexual couples who cannot have children, who must be married or have lived together for at least two years.
In Germany, artificial insemination is theoretically open to all women - but it is often difficult for single or lesbian couples.
Climate compensation: calls for a free flight for universities are making a big noise
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the implementation of the programme, which will be implemented in the coming years.
The Commission has also proposed that the universities should limit their ability to fly.
The debate on a climate tax on flights by universities and universities, which was delayed before the summer break, is once again taking shape. After the National Rectors' Conference had reacted skeptically to a corresponding push from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans are now receiving support from the universities.
Russia is once again catching North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB, the detainees were alleged to have been fishing illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier, 161 North Korean fishermen had been arrested. At the time, there was a shootout between border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later succumbed to his serious injuries.
The Communist North Korea is suffering from a chronic food shortage, and the North Korean fishermen were reportedly travelling in Russian waters, where the Russian coast guard is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources.
30,000 tin fish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 tin fish were discovered and seized on the boats, and information on three fishing boats and two motorboats was seized and taken to Nachodka and Posjet near Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to the North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen who were fishing with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia, which would also remove small creatures from the sea and simply dump the nets into the sea, where they would take 200 years to decompose.
In the future, only 18,000: U.S. lowering the asylum limit
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police officials at the White House.
The richest country in the world is sheltering itself from asylum seekers: as the State Department in Washington confirms, the ceiling for the legal movement of refugees will be further lowered, with the aim of providing asylum primarily to threatened believers and Iraqis.
The US government is trying to lower the historically low limit for new refugees, and in the 2020 fiscal year, which runs from October 2019 to September 2020, the US State Department said it would allow up to 18,000 people to enter the country, with the limit now nearly reaching 30,000.
The administration of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception of asylum seekers from around the world in recent years, and under the previous administration of Barack Obama, far higher reception limits had been imposed.
The targeted cap of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. refugee program was introduced in 1980, but the State Department called the United States "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a phrase that is reminiscent of the language of the sitting U.S. president.
A "responsible approach" to refugees aims to help refugees return to their home countries to help rebuild, Trump said. He has been widely acclaimed by his supporters for his tough migration policy course, but he has also received massive criticism.
A major point of contention is the border with Mexico that Trump wants to lock down. To finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had imposed a national emergency. Whether there is a time link between the current measure and current domestic policy developments in the US capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure over the Selensky affair and a potentially threatened impeachment process.
The US government intends to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees, people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk, as the State Department's statement shows, while a maximum of 1,500 refugees from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are expected to be accepted.
The United States wants to get people from this "northern triangle" of Central America to seek asylum in other countries, and it is against this background that the United States has signed migration agreements with Guatemala and now with El Salvador and Honduras to curb immigration at the US southern border with Mexico.
Court orders release of orangutan from zoo
An orangutan female has been transferred from the former Buenos Aires zoo to a human monkey capture station in the United States at the request of the Argentine judiciary. The "Sandra" born in 1986 in the Rostock zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person", so her release is mandatory. The animal was brought to Dallas on Thursday evening by direct flight - but not as a passenger, but in the cargo compartment, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Because the 53-kilogram-long ape is unable to adapt to wildlife, it is expected to live in the open-air area of the Center for Great Apes in Florida, which already houses 21 other orangutans and 31 chimpanzees, including "Bubbles", formerly the pet of pop star Michael Jackson.
Sandra spent several years in the former Ruhr Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before moving to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 animal rights trial by animal rights activists has helped transform the Buenos Aires Zoo into an ecopark.
Record for Swiss extreme climbers: 550 metres in 46 minutes
Extreme climber Dani Arnold has had a new ride on the almost 3,000-meter-high Great Tin in the Italian Alps.
Without power, double ground or other means, the Swiss captured the 550-meter-high north wall of the Great Wall in a new record time.
Dressed in jeans, T-shirt and supported only by absolute freedom from delusion, Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds to climb, nearly 19 minutes below the old record.
Arnold is now the record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important northern European walls.
Nike benefits from a new online marketing strategy
U.S. sportswear manufacturer Nike has posted a significant profit surge despite the trade conflict with China. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion (almost 1.3 billion euros) in the last quarter, up 25 percent from the previous year, the company said on Tuesday.
Sales rose to $10.7 billion in the three-month period through the end of August, with Nike's sales increasing the most, with a 22 percent increase in China, and the Beaverton-based company in Oregon also benefited from its approach to target consumers directly via the Internet or smartphone apps in the People's Republic of China.
Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion announced that Nike will continue to drive the sporting goods manufacturer's "digital transformation" with strategic investments, expanding its competitive advantage.
Lifelong ban on racial sports in Italy
Due to racist comments about football pro Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the club from the Italian capital has imposed a lifetime stadium ban on a fan. The Brazilian defender Jesus had been slandered by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and urged his club to take action. "@officialasroma You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToRacism.
The club responded late Thursday, reporting the fan's Instagram account to the police, and the Roma fan will never be allowed to attend a club match again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Racism is a problem in Italian football. Italian fans regularly chant racist insults against black players of rival teams. "We cannot have racism in society or in sport. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. The responsible must be identified and thrown off the stages", FIFA President Gianni Infantino said over the weekend.
The Italian authorities have now banned 38 fans of the record-setting Juventus Turin from the stadium, four of whom are banned from entering the stadium for a period of ten years, the police said.
The fans are linked to ongoing investigations into 12 leaders of ultra-captain groups around Juventus, including those accused of serious blackmail, money laundering and private violence, which the club launched last year with an ad.
According to Italian media reports, the ultra-leaders are behind the black-ticket trade, "militarily controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and allegedly blackmailed Juventus employees to get cheaper tickets.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millennials are narcissistic, Generation Z is political -- whole years are thought of by catchy names. If you look closely, the awards are full of contradictions. So how well do these labels describe the feelings of young people in their lives?
"The crab is coming!" With this call, the crab fishing at Lake Gucheng in Gaochun officially began on September 21, marking the opening ceremony of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Public Relations Department of the Nanjing Gaochun District Committee.
Gaochun, which forms the southern outcrop of Nanjing in Jiangsu Province, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "slow city" in China and is also the Chinese headquarters of the international "slow city" movement. The city has ideal ecological conditions with a mixture of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water and 50 percent fields". Gaochun's magnificent natural environment offers its inhabitants all the conditions to become rich.
The people of Gaochun started to raise crab in the early 1990s. Over time, the crab industry has developed into a dominant industry that has provided high incomes and has become an important part of Gaochun's economic development. In recent years, Gaochun has actively pursued large-scale, ecological and scientific development of crab production as well as a technology-based crab production.
In recent years, Gaochun has introduced a reform on "power distribution, optimization of administration and public services" and has carefully built up the service network for "authorization under one roof, a law enforcement team, a service network, a lending platform", with the aim of making the city fully optimized for the environment for authorization, services and development.
Gaochun is taking full advantage of the local benefits of connectivity to Southern Jiangsu and Southern Anhui, and is using the development zone and its status as an international 'slow city' as a benchmark to promote smart high-end production, biomedical and medical technology, energy storage and environmental protection, cultural and healthcare, and ecological agriculture businesses leading the '3+2' area. At the same time, Gaochun has been promoting the development of a national, all-encompassing tourism and tourism sector of national importance.
Iran-US conflict: Rouhani talks about ending sanctions - Trump disagrees
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has spoken after his return from the UN General Assembly of an alleged US offer to lift sanctions, the United States having put an end to all sanctions in return for talks with the Tehran leadership, Rouhani said on his official website.
But US President Donald Trump disagreed with his Iranian counterpart on Twitter: "Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on it so there would be a meeting.
Rouhani described the events as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were in New York and insisted that a meeting be held. "And America says I lift the sanctions", Rouhani added.
However, this move was not in an acceptable manner, Ruhani criticised.Given the penalties in force and the "poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
Earlier this week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Rouhani in New York. The background was the hope of Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China with Iran, which is to prevent the Islamic Republic from developing nuclear weapons.
Severe earthquake near Istanbul - Nearly 200 aftershocks
After two earthquakes in western Turkey have shaken within a short period of time, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured in the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the quake the day before, there have been almost 200 aftershocks, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday, adding to the concern about a disaster.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, hundreds of buildings were damaged, and the 5.8 magnitude earthquake on Thursday shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul, causing panic in the multi-million-dollar metropolis, and the government is now planning to set up a commission to prepare the country for future earthquakes, Oktay announced.
Turkey has not been sufficiently prepared for earthquakes in the past 20 years, said Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, and the latent danger is repeatedly ignored in the city itself. Every year poorly built houses collapse - including the many smaller earthquakes that regularly shake Istanbul.
City planners like the famous architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open spaces, which have been registered as a sanctuary in the center, have long been built.
The epicenter of Thursday's quake was in the Marmara Sea off the Silivri district and at a depth of about seven kilometers, according to the Afad disaster protection agency.
Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu tweeted that no injuries or damage had been reported at first. The state broadcaster TRT showed people running out of their homes in panic. Students were evacuated from buildings in Silivri district for security reasons.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Under the Sea of Marmara lies a section of the so-called North Atlantic fault, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and Anatolian plates. Turkey is constantly shaken by earthquakes. One of the deadliest was the 1999 earthquake near Istanbul.
Researchers fear that a magnitude 7.1 to 7.4 earthquake could threaten the country, but it is unclear when it will happen.
Companies design contingency plans, individuals have so-called go-bags packed with everything necessary, and schools teach children how to behave when the earth quakes.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said after returning from New York that eight people were injured, some buildings suffered minor damage, and Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was monitoring developments from the Istanbul Disaster Coordination Center (Akom), which said that two minarets of mosques in Avcilar and Sariyer districts collapsed.
Warning of aftershocks in Istanbul
Many users on social media are reporting panic. Buildings have been shaken. Schools and hospitals have been evacuated. Phone lines have been cut. It has been more violent than Tuesday, writes one user. The head of the Turkish Red Crescent, Kerem Clinic, warned on Twitter about aftershocks. He urged people to stay away from buildings that have suffered visible damage.
The official time of the quake is 1:59 p.m. local time, and CNN Turkey reports that just minutes after the first quake, a magnitude 4.0 quake was recorded on the judge's scale.
Only on Tuesday had a magnitude 4.6 earthquake shaken the Turkish Marmara region - it was felt as far as Istanbul. Its epicenter was also in the Marmara Sea west of the million-metric city, the disaster protection agency Afad said on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that made headlines on Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a major earthquake.
Researchers are predicting that sooner or later there could be a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will eventually discharge - and cause massive damage.
Earthquake researcher Sukru Ersoy estimates that the earthquake is now a warning, which has made it more likely, he told CNN Türk. "These could be the signs of a bigger earthquake", Ersoy told the station. "Sooner or later the big earthquake will come".
A few weeks ago there was an incident - the earthquake caused great concern in Istanbul as well. In Albania, there was also a severe earthquake just a few days ago - 68 people were injured.
Parliament: New fuel in the Ukraine affair
Two breaking documents are a new fuel in the Ukraine affair for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible impeachment proceedings, the US Democrats are seeing strengthening: the complaint filed by an anonymous whistleblower about Trump and his controversial phone call with the Ukrainian president provide important clues for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once again as a victim of a "witch hunt".
United States: United Airlines passenger locked in a toilet - airman diverted
Because a passenger was trapped in the boarding room, a United Airlines flight was diverted, and the toilet door was blocked during flight 1554 from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported, according to U.S. media.
In an unplanned interim landing on Wednesday evening (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally released from the confined cabin, where she had been locked for about an hour, US media reported, citing other passengers.
A video posted online, reported by US media, of Flight 1554, shows several people trying to free the woman. "We're working on opening the door right now, ma'am. We'll get you out soon, okay?" says a man in it.
The cockroaches: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writing Brexit novel
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with all the Brexit chaos? He's writing a book about it - and his protagonist is unmistakable.
Inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Transformation", British author Ian McEwan (71) has written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "The Cockroach" will be published in German on November 27, Diogenes Verlag (Zurich) reported. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life but is now suddenly the most powerful man in Britain.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "If Parliament is closed so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, if ministers shamelessly lie like the Soviet leaders, if Brexiters in high positions almost imply the disaster of a no-deal, then a writer must ask himself what he can do.
Kafka's first published account, published in 1915, tells the story of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning to find himself "turning into a giant insect", gradually being excluded from family and society, and finally being destroyed.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria's rail infrastructure
11,200 cars in Austria and Hungary will be fitted with whistle brakes to reduce the noise caused by freight trains.
The EU authorities have said that this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions, and the funds come from the EU's infrastructure package, the Connecting Europe Facility.
All travel cancelled until 31 October
German travel operator Thomas Cook cancelled all trips until 31 October 2019, a day after his insolvency application.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether to grant the aid to the airport in the form of a loan to the airport, which is subject to the conditions laid down in Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
Thomas Cook in Germany was drawn into the bankruptcy of the British parent company and filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday.
Insurance company wants to transfer money back to hotels now
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that are still hosting Thomas Cook holidaymakers will receive money from Zurich insurance.
Based on booking information and no separate invoices, hotels in the holiday resorts are now expected to receive 50 percent of outstanding payments, according to a Zurich spokesman for the German Press Agency. "This applies immediately and on the condition that Thomas Cook travelers from these hotels will not be required to pay individual hotel bills or otherwise", said spokesman Bernd Engelien.
The insurance company responded to reports of hotel guests who had been forced to pay for their accommodation on the premises, some of whom had to put more than €1,000 on the table, which the German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had sharply criticised.
The number of hotels affected will be coordinated with the insolvent travel provider on Friday, the insurance spokesman said.According to Thursday's figures, there were still 70,000 Thomas Cook package holidaymakers on the way from Germany.Zurich Germany has secured Thomas Cook customers' holidays and return.
Insolvency managers want to try to keep the three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
The company has announced that it will cancel all travel until 31 October, including those bookings that have already been paid for.
As regards travel starting from 1 November 2019, the company has left open. In line with the insolvency insurance, it said that further proceedings were being examined.
The company refers to the Zurich insurer, represented by Kaera. Customers could find out on the Kaera website about how to refund the fare and claim their claims via a web form.
Prince Harry destroys mines in Angola
Prince Harry has long followed Lady Diana's lead, and now in Africa he is following in his mother's footsteps.
In a blue suit of armor, Prince Harry of England set off and destroyed a mine in Angola.
Near a British Halo Trust camp near the village of Dirico, he set off the fireball in front of TV cameras on Friday morning. At a safe distance, the explosive exploded in the savannah landscape without causing damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 minefields threatening the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry then wanted to walk in the city of Huambo directly in the footsteps of his mother Diana (1961-1997). With the same bomber who once accompanied his mother, he wanted to follow the path she was following.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist capital of Cape Town.
Brexit negotiations are stalled: the risk of no deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had made it clear that he would not guarantee a third delay in Brexit negotiations, but what the polarizing British have said has been going on for a long time. The recent ruling of the UK Supreme Court hovers like a Damocles sword over the blonde's head. His suspension of Parliament to keep its Brexit course until the exit date was cancelled earlier this week. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to cause an extension of bilateral talks with the EU until 31 October if negotiations fail. Johnson had categorically ruled out this.
Boris Johnson thinks a deal is still possible
But the pressure on Johnson doesn't seem to go away, either, and he has hinted at a hospital visit that he would support an extension of the negotiations by the end of October if there were a disagreement.
You know, we're gonna follow the law.
But at the same time, we are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October.
I'm cautiously optimistic that this will work.
And time is running out for Brexit negotiators in Brussels. There are still about six weeks left for the EU and British negotiators to prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without an agreement. But even the most recent talks have failed to break through. A deal until the end of October seems rather difficult to imagine at the moment. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new postponement of the exit date is in effect. The opposition does not believe the Prime Minister's words, but they fear that in the event of a no-deal, Johnson might somehow enforce Brexit.
US authorities: More deaths from e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to e-cigarette use in the United States has risen to 12. There are now 805 confirmed and probable injuries related to e-cigarette use, the CDC reported. According to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine, there have been more than 900 cases, about 500 of which have been confirmed. The cause of lung damage is still completely unclear. No similar increase in lung damage is known in Europe so far. The complaints appear to be limited to users in the United States.
Fear of new protests in Egypt rises
The video of Mohammed Ali has been shared millions of times online. The Spanish-based contractor and actor is calling for a "people's revolution". For Friday, he called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military, which critics accuse of corruption and mismanagement. Ali is hoping for mass investigations with a million participants in central places of the country.
The security authorities are alarmed, and police have been increasingly present in central Cairo, several metro stations have been closed, roads around Tahrir Square have been blocked, and police have been stepping up their road checks in recent days, searching the mobile phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20, protesters also gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend, hundreds of protesters gathered in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura, a protest that had not been so open in Egypt for years, and the security forces responded strongly. Human Rights Watch said nearly 2,000 people had been arrested since last week, many of them arbitrarily - simply because they were "in the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW said, citing lawyers for those arrested.
The organization also criticized the censorship in the North African country, saying the government in Cairo is blocking websites and online services to curb further protests against al-Sisi. The general has ruled the country since 2013, after overthrowing democratically elected Islamist President Mohammed Morsi.
"Ocean Change": Arved fox from Greenland expedition back
The polar explorer Arved Fuchs returned from his Greenland expedition on Friday, and was greeted on arrival at the port of Hamburg by the skipper Boris Herrmann, who had brought climate activist Greta Thunberg across the Atlantic with the racing yacht "Malizia".
With a team of scientists, Fox had been studying and documenting the effects of global warming on his sailing ship Dagmar Aaen off the coast of Iceland and Greenland in recent months.
The Fridays for Future movement is a blessing, said the polar scientist. He waited years for the younger generation to speak up. It has been known for decades that the Earth is warming. Yet many acted as if there were a planet B.
"What happens in the sea is often done outside the public eye", Fuchs said. "He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the pollution of the seas.
For his "fight for the sustainable and respectful use of the world's oceans", the polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" during the Hamburg Climate Week. "For all of us who care about the survival of the oceans, Arved Fuchs is a great role model", said skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony.
Expensive spaghetti in Rome: tourists paid 430 euros for noodles
430 euros for two plates of spaghetti and fish in a simple restaurant near the castle of Angels in Rome: it seemed too much for two Japanese tourists. The bill, including 80 euros of tip money, was paid by the two women, but they posted the receipt on Facebook, which sparked a heated reaction.
"These cases are damaging Rome's reputation. We call on the police to investigate whether this is a fraud", a spokesman for Federagit, the association of travel guides in Rome, told the daily Il Messaggero (Friday issue).
The owner of the restaurant immediately responded that the Japanese had ordered not only spaghetti but also fresh fish, the owner of the restaurant said, but that this was not to be inferred from the bill.
After the turbulent revelations of recent days, US President Donald Trump may actually be facing impeachment proceedings, which the Democrats want to review with their investigation in the House of Representatives as soon as possible - it's weeks before a decision is made.
The alleged start of the scandal is the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky.The whistleblower's accusation, which ultimately brought the conversation to the public with his complaint about national security and US democracy, is monstrous: the president abused his power to instrumentalise the government of another country to influence the 2020 election, using Ukraine's dependence to blackmail them into actively fighting a political opponent.
The core of this project can also be seen in the now published synopsis of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not give the full text. The July 25 phone call is only one episode of a much larger story, centered on Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.
The story begins from the perspective of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times reports Rudy Giuliani's travel plans to Ukraine. He wants to meet with the newly elected President Selensky in Kiev, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are delicate. "We are not interfering in an election, we are interfering in an investigation of what we have the right to do", he says to the newspaper.
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with right-wing conspiracy fantasies that are fixed on Trump's 2016 presidential nominee: Hillary Clinton conspired with actors in Ukraine, critics said at the time, to construct a cause for Russia investigations in the United States.
The latest version of Giuliani and the president is that former vice president and currently a promising candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden, as the Obama administration's Ukraine representative, pressed for the release of the then Ukrainian Attorney General Viktor Shokin to stop the investigation of the gas company, whose supervisory board his son Hunter Biden was a member of. Biden senior blackmailed Ukraine financially to undermine the corrupt activities of his family.
In fact, the process was a little different. When Joe Biden demanded that the Ukrainian Attorney General should leave, the investigation against the gas company was already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. Shokin was also deeply accused of corruption, the US government was by no means the only Western partner who pressed for his release.
Instagram disruptions Facebook and WhatsApp: social media down
Users around the world report massive disruptions to Instagram and Facebook. This is particularly affecting Germany, the UK and Spain. On the website allstorns.de users report that Facebook has been unloading continuously since about 3:30 pm. Instagram also issues the error message that content could not be loaded.
Instagram and Co. more frequently affected by disruptions
It's not the first massive disruption this year, as services had been down for several hours in March and July, and as in previous cases, users are back on Twitter this time to vent their anger.
Polish scientists rescued in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the ice of the Antarctic by the Chilean Air Force, who were on a tugboat several miles from their base when their engine failed, and were lucky to have been in the accident - the Chilean rescue helicopter took less than an hour to rescue.
Eduardo Mosquera, commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"We got the call at 9:30 a.m., just before 10 p.m., and 20 minutes later we were over the tube boat".
Poland has operated the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island since 1977, 19 scientists are working there.
Warning: Smartphone is NOT wirelessly charging
Practical but harmful
Although inductive technique via Qi standard is extremely practical, it should not be used.
Since recently several new smartphones have been launched that support wireless charging and sell very well - especially the new iPhone 11 models - we would like to recall a study from early July that, while wireless charging is extremely practical, it is not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature is setting the battery on
The University of Warwick has found that wireless charging is extremely harmful to devices, and this is due to the significantly greater heat development. If you charge a phone normally by cable, the battery will heat up to 27 degrees within three hours. When wireless charging, the researchers have always measured over 30 degrees, even when the smartphone is perfectly positioned on the charging pad.
Capacity and lifetime
The researchers say that temperature is a crucial factor in battery life. Each degree plays a role. When charging at higher temperatures, the battery not only reduces capacity, but it also doesn't last as long overall. The battery life is therefore shorter. The researchers therefore recommend that the smartphone is always charged by cable. Since a battery switch on modern smartphones is always associated with high costs, this should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently even increased the cost of a battery switch - and indeed for all iPhones.
Practical
The technology is extremely convenient: simply install the device on a charger - which is already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery is charged without the need for heavy cable and heavy plug-in smoke.
Everest Stau photographer: 138,000 in six months
A Nepalese mountaineer has climbed 13 of the world's 14 highest mountains in just six months, according to his own account. Nirmal Purja (36) has reached the summit of Manaslu in Nepal, setting a record, his expedition organizer said.
The former soldier wants to climb all 148,000 in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has made international headlines once: He took a viral photo of mountaineers standing on Mount Everest's slope in the spring.
The image of the mass impact sparked a debate about increased security measures on the 8,848-meter-high mountain and the highest peak on earth.
A problem for Purja could be the 14th Ascent: Chinese authorities are currently blocking Xixabangma Mountain in Tibet, citing bad weather as one of the reasons. Earlier this week, Purja tweeted that the government of Nepal wanted to talk to China to allow it to ascend.
Four dead elephants discovered in Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was a pregnant elephant cow, a police spokesman said on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four bodies were found in a protected area near the famous and popular tourist site of Sigiriya, the old rock fortress, where the animals were believed to be between 15 and 25 years old, according to a police spokesman.
In Sri Lanka, almost 200 elephants are killed every year, often by farmers whose land the animals had previously kept intact, and about 50 people are killed by elephants every year, mostly when the animals move through villages built near their habitat.
In Sri Lanka, it is estimated that there are only about 7,000 elephants left, and theoretically, the death penalty is for killing them.
British oil tanker in detention leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is leaving the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after it was captured by Iran, the Iranian naval authority reported, according to the Iranian news agency IRNA.
Management by Thomas Cook in the criticism
The House of Commons's Economic Committee wants to investigate the bankruptcy of travel giant Thomas Cook in detail, including the board's salary packages and why the UK government was not willing to finance the survivalist company. "We are interested in the company's oversight as well as the controls of external auditors", said Commission Chair Rachel Reeves in London. "We are obviously dealing with a bad example of management greed".
Experts say genes are overestimated in the risk of colon cancer
The role of genes in family-related increased risk of colon cancer has apparently been overestimated so far. To this conclusion researchers at the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come in a recent study.Other risk factors such as family eating habits are likely to weigh heavier than previously thought.
Elon Musk raises Tesla shares
Musk wrote this in an email to Tesla employees posted by the industry blog Electrek on Thursday, saying that the demand was high, so Tesla could book 110,000 orders, Musk's circular continued.
The challenge is to get the cars to customers quickly, and Tesla must offer as many resources as possible by the end of the quarter.
Investors liked the information: Tesla's shares went out of business with a surge of over six percent. The price hasn't been up that strong in nearly four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well over 95,000 cars, reaching its all-time high.
Musk needs records to reach his high goals. In 2019, he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, he needs to produce six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter. Mostly the cheapest Tesla Model 3 is in demand, but here the profit margins are low. Despite the boom, there were recent losses.
Will the British government circumvent the Brexit Act?
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been shy about whether he is looking for ways to circumvent the latest law passed by Parliament against an unregulated Brexit.
The law requires the government to request a delay of the withdrawal date if no deal is reached with the EU by mid-October.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday suggested that Johnson might try to use "political bullying" to circumvent the law, and that Johnson might use a procedural trick to delay the law's entry into force until after leaving the EU.
Johnson said he was seeking a deal with the European Union. "We are confident that we will leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran is apparently increasing uranium enrichment
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has increased pressure on European nuclear partners in the dispute over the historic nuclear deal. "Unfortunately, European states show inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete action", Rouhani said at a press conference outside the UN General Assembly in New York on Thursday.
The United States has withdrawn from the agreement in 2018 alone to force Iran to change course with "maximum pressure" in what is considered aggressive Middle East policy. President Donald Trump's administration wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher conditions and is now reimposing tough sanctions against Tehran.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic is now using or at least preparing for use the centrifuges installed in early September.
Perhaps the Europeans are not willing to take their share of the deal and so have left the Iranians alone with the cost and burden of pressing US sanctions, Rouhani suspected.
Rouhani continues to deny Iran's involvement in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, the general attitude changed after an attack on a major oil facility in Saudi Arabia in mid-September: Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Monday followed the US assessment that Tehran was responsible for the attack.
"Those who make such accusations must present evidence", Rouhani said. European leaders would not have been able to do this in their talks with him during the UN General Debate, but instead would have relied on the fact that the rebels in Yemen could not carry out such an attack.
Before any talks with US President Trump, the US administration's far-reaching sanctions should first be lifted, Rouhani demanded. He urged the Washington government to shift to a policy of "dialogue and reason".
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of space, which they have done before, and the comet is making conclusions about other solar systems.
What was originally just a guess is now confirmed: an interstellar guest crosses our solar system, the comet from deep space, named after its discoverer, 2I/Borisov, has aroused the interest of astronomers around the world.
The longest-traveled comet was discovered on August 30 by amateur astronomer Gennadi Borisov at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built 65-centimeter diameter telescope.
2I/Borisov is the second interstellar object to be seen in a transit of our solar system after 1I/'Oumuamua in 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare opportunity to get close-up insights into an alien solar system before it disappears into oblivion. Early observations show that the interstellar comet is similar to our own system, as reported by the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands. "The comet's current speed is about 150,000 kilometers per hour, which is well above the typical speeds of objects orbiting the sun at this distance", NASA spokesman Davide Farnocchia said in a statement.
The comet is analyzed to be traveling on a so-called hyperorbital path that leads it out of our system - and clearly of interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for naming and categorizing celestial bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar pendulum, which was initially named C/2019 Q4, was given the designation 2I/Borisov, with the first part of the name indicating that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
The astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in the vicinity. So the researchers have many months to investigate. "The object will reach its greatest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explained Farnocchia. "Then it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observatories have already targeted the visitor, so a team led by Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumuamua, in an initial study determined the diameter of the celestial object to be 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers at the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already obtained the first spectrum of the interstellar pendulum, which provides a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to that of comets in our solar system, and this suggests that they must be similar in composition", IAC researcher Julia de León reported.
The discovery of as many as two interstellar visitors within just two years suggests that the IAU estimates that these objects could open a new path to exploring certain processes in other solar systems. However, it is still difficult to estimate how frequent such key visits are. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly intercept a planned ESA satellite mission.
The agency intends to station the three-part spacecraft Comet Interceptor (comet interceptor) in a waiting position 1.5 million kilometres from Earth by 2028.
First landing at Beijing's new Daxing mega airport
Just in time for the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic, the first passenger plane of China United Airlines has landed at the new mega-airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a special honour for the captain and crew.
The new airport is expected to handle around 45 million passengers annually by 2022, and by 2025 it will have reached 72 million. Chinese President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion project.
The complex has four runways, which will be expanded to seven later, and is equipped with the world's largest automatic air traffic management system.
The opening of the capital's airport, which has been under construction since 2006, has been postponed several times, but the first passenger plane landed in Beijing four years later.
New supersonic aircraft to fly in 2030: four and a half hours from London to Sydney
London to Sydney in just four and a half hours - the UK Space Agency's dream - is to enable this 2030s-oriented overhead flight with a special engine (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre) developed by Reaction Engines, an Oxfordshire company, CNN quoted the agency as saying. "This is the technology that could definitely do this", said agency chief Graham Turnock to the station. "We are talking about the 2030s for commissioning, and the work is already very advanced".
The British Space Agency is working closely with the Australian Space Agency to advance the project. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis currently takes about 20 hours. As the only supersonic passenger transport aircraft to date, Concorde covered the New York-Paris route from 1976 until its cessation in 2003, taking three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident at the launch of a Concorde at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport, which killed all 109 passengers. Last year, the US aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin announced plans to develop a supersonic plane, the "Plane X-Virgin".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport", Reaction Engines writes on its homepage, among other things. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travel at a speed of Mach 5 - which means five times faster than sound.
Trump wants to track down anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In the Ukraine affair over the possible abuse of power by the US president, Donald Trump wants to track down potential leaks in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the whistleblower the information", Trump told staff at the U.S. Embassy in New York on Thursday, saying the person was almost "a spy" and was treated "a little differently" in the past than he is today.
The event was not actually public, but several US media outlets on Friday broadcast audio clips of the speech, and Democrats reacted indignantly to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives announced Tuesday that they were preparing for impeachment proceedings against Trump, based primarily on a written complaint from an anonymous intelligence official who is making serious allegations against Trump and his administration headquarters.
As part of his work, the whistleblower wants to get information from several government officials that the US president is "using the power of his office" to get another country to interfere in his favor in the 2020 US election.
The allegations center on a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Selensky in late July, in which Trump encouraged his colleagues to investigate things that could harm his political rival Joe Biden, including Biden's son Hunter's past business in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his baby from the Ukrainian judiciary.
The whistleblower also accused the White House of covering up the Ukrainian telephone: senior government officials had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under wraps. As usual, an electronic wording protocol had been created, but this was removed from a roughly intended database at the request of White House lawyers and instead stored in a particularly protected system.
The identity of the whistleblower is not publicly known, and the New York Times reported that he was an employee of the CIA.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday, and in a series of tweets on the subject, the president wrote, among other things, that the "so-called whistleblower" had spread second-hand information that turned out to be inaccurate, so there may not be any tipsters or spies at all.
As Trump commented in New York on those who allegedly leaked information to the whistleblower, but provoked outrage, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reacted with concern and lamented that Trump's statement once again undermines the integrity of the government.
The House of Representatives has been conducting various investigations against Trump and his entourage for months, and now, in light of the allegations against Ukraine, the Democrats are pushing forward with new force to launch a possible impeachment process against Trump.
"The whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation", said House Intelligence Committee chief Adam Schiff. Trump lashed out at Schiff, accused him of misrepresenting things and again demanded the resignation of the committee chairman. Trump regularly slanders Schiff and had demanded his resignation months earlier.
More than 300 former U.S. government security and foreign policy officials, who worked mostly under Democratic and Republican presidents, said in a statement released Friday that they were behind the investigation by Democrats into possible impeachment proceedings.
The Democrats, with their majority in the House of Representatives, could push for a so-called impeachment process, but the decision to remove Trump's Republican majority was made in the Senate, where the prospects for such a process are low. So far, no U.S. president has been removed by impeachment.
VW: jobs are being cut "slicing"
The VW brand's plans to further reduce costs in production could be at the expense of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the carmaker's Works Council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs by two billion euros by 10 billion euros by 2023, of which 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
The 'future pact' negotiated between the company and the Works Council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020.
However, as our newspaper learned from the working parties, jobs in production that were not actually available were being "sliced" down another way - bypassing the official course - so that regular jobs that were being released would often not be reclaimed.
In these cases, the Works Council had no way of forcing the re-employment.Many jobs now lack staff to assume the workload, worries about a gradual bleeding out of the workshops are growing, and there is growing concern that vehicle production could be gradually withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is cheaper in other parts of the world.VW simply stated: 'An adjustment of the employment volume is being made as agreed socially compatible along the demographic curve.'
The VW brand wants to further standardize production worldwide and centrally control new projects, which will also reduce costs and speed up decisions - all of which will increase productivity and thus competitiveness.
For example, for the first time since 2013, the production costs per vehicle would fall compared to the previous year.Tostmann told reporters that the production time for the Golf 8, which is to be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg, will be reduced by 1.1 hours.
Twenty hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg plant is the only VW plant where vehicles are produced. The Braunschweig and Salzgitter plants produce components. For Wolfsburg, the rule of thumb is that 800,000 cars must be built there annually in order for the plant to be profitable. In 2018, however, only around 700,000 vehicles were used in Wolfsburg - due to declining diesel demand and the problems in switching to the new WLTP consumption and exhaust gas testing process.
As production manager Tostmann announced last year, a million cars will be rolled out of the line in Wolfsburg, but this will allow the grouping of Golf production at the parent plant, because the Zwickau plant will be able to produce Golf by converting it into an e-car production site.
The Volvo Cars are also being produced in Wolfsburg, where the Tiguan and Tarraco SUVs (seat) are being produced, but the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently been declining.
Forced into prostitution with voodoo: Human traffickers condemned
Young Nigerian women have been beaten with ulcers, dragged into the Ruhr and forced into prostitution, and six suspected human traffickers are facing prison sentences.
Six alleged Nigerian traffickers were sentenced to imprisonment and probation for up to eight years and three months in Bochum on Friday, after the defendants had forced young Nigerian women into the Ruhr region and forced them into prostitution.
The victims were aged between 17 and 22 years old, and were transported by Libyan sloughboats across the Mediterranean, but the dream of a better future was not fulfilled.
The defendants - four men and two women - admitted to the imprisonment and subsequent distribution of the Nigerian girls in brothels during the trial. "The work made it physically and mentally difficult to provide for the women", said Judge Isabel Hoffmann in the sentencing. "Some were really disgusting".
The judgments relate to the employment and bonding of foreigners, trafficking in persons, bribery and forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIn a continuing dispute with the Lufthansa Group, the Ufo flight attendants' union has again threatened to strike.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the union will "inform on 14 October of the labour-fighting measures in the LH Group", said Ufo Tariff Director Daniel Flohr on Friday.
In this respect, Ufo is now strengthened by a decision of the Frankfurt Labour Court. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the collective agreements were not terminated. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and is considering bringing an action against it.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted a request to the Frankfurt Regional Labour Court to have the status of the Ufo as a trade union examined in court.
A fierce leadership dispute had been ongoing in the Spartans' union, in the course of which numerous members of the Executive Board and the Advisory Board resigned, including the longtime union leader Nicoley Baublies.
Easier entry: Saudi Arabia announces new visa system
Until now, Saudi Arabia was not known as an international tourist magnet, but that is about to change now.
With a new visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract more international tourists in the future.By 2030, it intends to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission said.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia to international tourists is a historic moment for our country", said the chairman of the Tourism Commission, Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists to access.Visas are usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with relatives in the desert state.The new rules will increase the tourism revenue of the conservative kingdom.
In mid-September, several missiles and drones hit two of the most important oil facilities in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Churais oilfield.
Justin and Hailey Bieber are getting ready for their wedding party
Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) are preparing for their wedding party. The model posted several party photos on her Instagram Stories on Thursday (local time) showing her in a white wedding look. Reality star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had organized a bachelor party in Los Angeles, according to People magazine.
Justin posted several colorful, banana-printed suits on Instagram, among others, asking his followers, "Help me pick my tuxedo for the wedding". According to media reports, the celebrity couple is planning to get married in church next weekend.
The Biebers gave themselves the "yes" word a year ago at a New York state office, and there was no bigger party then.
In an interview with Australian Vogue recently, Hailey explained that after initial problems, the two had found a common ground: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two dead in a plane crash in the Czech Republic
Two people were killed in a small plane crash in western Czech Republic, the wreckage of which was discovered on Friday in a forested area near the city of Mecin, police said.
The authorities had been searching for the plane since Thursday evening after the crew gave a GPS emergency signal, including a military helicopter, and the crash site is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen and 100 kilometres northeast of Regensburg.
Half of the European tree species are endangered
In addition to pests, diseases, non-native species, unsustainable logging and urban growth are also the threats, the IUCN reported on Friday in Brussels, studying the stocks of all 454 tree species known in Europe, 265 of which are found on no other continent, of which 265 are 58 percent threatened, 66 are already at the highest level of endangerment and thus on the brink of extinction.
The IUCN classifies endangered species into six categories: "potentially endangered" to "endangered", "highly endangered", "threatened to extinction" and "extinct in the wild" to "extinct". In total, it lists more than 28,000 animal and plant species as endangered worldwide.
Eberish and wild Roskastania threatened
In Germany, the majority of Eberus (Sorbus) are threatened, said one of the authors, David Allen, of the German Press Agency. "Most are threatened because the populations are small anyway or because their habitats are being transformed or weakened".
The wild common rosskastanians are also poorly affected. They have been classified as "endangered" since 2017, a level two on the IUCN scale. The largest threat, alongside a fungus, is the Balkan miniature moth. It has been spreading from south-eastern Europe throughout the continent since the 1980s and has few natural enemies. The IUCN estimates the number of wild rosskastanians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe at less than 10,000.
Shrubs and mosses also at risk
At the same time, IUCN scientists have created new European Red Lists for molluscs, shrubs and mosses. More than one fifth of molluscs and mosses and almost half of all species of reptiles are threatened, according to the IUCN. This is mainly due to the destruction of wildlife, trapped species, agricultural practices and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation is precarious for many overlooked and underestimated species, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet", said Luc Bas, IUCN Director of the Europe Office. "We must limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority".
Istanbul earthquake: 34 injured reported
The latest earthquake in Turkey has injured 34 people, no fatalities, dozens of people have been forced to leave their homes, and 14 schools in Istanbul have been closed for security reasons, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday.
Hundreds of buildings were damaged, according to the report, and since the earthquake the day before, there have been nearly 200 aftershocks, with a magnitude of 5.8 quake that shook the Marmara region outside Istanbul on Thursday, and triggered panic in the million-dollar city.
Now the government wants to set up a commission to better prepare the country for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
Istanbul is considered particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Sea of Marmara is a section of the so-called North Atlantic disorder, which marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolian plates.
One of the most severe earthquakes was a magnitude 7.6 quake in 1999 near Istanbul, the epicenter of which was then in Gölcük, southeast of Istanbul, killing more than 17,000 people.
Already on Tuesday, a magnitude 4.6 earthquake had shaken the region around Istanbul, and authorities urged residents to stay away from damaged buildings.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira perform in the halftime show
Latin pop singers Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will host the semi-final show of the upcoming American football Super Bowl. The singers announced this on Twitter. "It's not getting bigger", Shakira wrote of a photo of herself and Lopez.
Jennifer Lopez said that she had dreamed of performing in the Super Bowl since 1996 - when she saw Diana Ross flying into the sky at the halftime show. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I'm going to perform with another Latina". She couldn't wait to "show what we girls can do on the biggest stage in the world".
Shakira said in a statement that she is honored to be standing next to another artist on one of the world's biggest stages and representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and around the world. "And then on my birthday too!" The event's main sponsor tweeted, "This is the first time the two "queens" have been on a stage together".
Shakira is from Colombia, Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents are from Puerto Rico.
Fighting the decline in viewership
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the halftime show are among the most watched TV shows in the U.S. Even if you've seen the latest decline in viewership, this February, the show attracted the fewest viewers in the U.S. in more than a decade. Still, it was still an average of nearly a hundred million people.
The mid-season show of the last Super Bowl had been a pre-emptive uproar: in the dispute over the deal with quarterback Colin Kaepernick, media reports said that in February, top stars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not want to perform.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of the San Francisco 49ers, had kneeled at the National Anthem in protest against police violence and racism before NFL games in the 2016/17 season. With his protest, Kaepernick triggered a movement, numerous players took up the gesture. This caused great excitement, US President Donald Trump attacked the mostly African American football stars sharply. Kaepernick himself has been united since March 2017 and has not contested an NFL game anymore.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from the insurance
Some banks are likely to face the bankruptcy of travel agent Thomas Cook, according to a press release, and there are high depreciation risks on outstanding bonds and loans, including Credit Suisse, the Financial Times reported on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or Credit Suisse would likely have to write off their books by a total of up to £1.8 billion (about €2 billion), according to the report, according to estimates by the consultancy AlixPartners.
Borrowers would have to buy off debts of between £900 million and £1 billion and lenders between £550 million and £825 million, an expert told the paper.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the European Union (OJ L 347, 28.10.1999, p.
Racket is said to have brought suspected killers to Italy
Sea-Watch captain Carola Rackete may have brought men to Italy who are believed to have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot rule this out, but we don't have any information on this", said the spokesman for the refugee organization Sea-Watch, Ruben Neugebauer, to the dpa news agency.
Other migrants had identified the three men in Italy. They are accused of raping, torturing and killing people in Libya. The alleged perpetrators were arrested in the detention camp in Messina, Italy. Neugebauer stressed that the refugee organizations could not verify who they had put on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rackete, who illegally brought migrants to the port of Lampedusa on 29 June and then ran over a ship belonging to the Italian financial police, is also said to have arrived there on the same day.
US warn the federal government against Huawei
The head of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, has warned the federal government against trusting the Chinese network operator Huawei.
We believe the risks are too great", Pai told the "Trade Gazette" in view of the construction of the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law" that obliges every company "under Chinese jurisdiction" to follow the instructions of the security authorities.
The FCC chief continued, "The current law also prohibits companies from informing third parties of such requests". This makes it very difficult to trust the integrity of technical equipment and services.
The German government has now agreed to require suppliers to provide a 'declaration of confidence'.
Berlin wants to try to control the risks first, for example by using technical solutions, the 'Handelblatt' reports, citing its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. 5G technology is not just hardware:
"The software is essential to keep the devices up to date, and it's made up of billions of lines of program code that change over time", Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine" that a government agency "would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks", the FCC chief continued.
He accuses the Chinese conglomerate Huawei of having close ties to the Chinese state apparatus:
The ownership is opaque. The employee company, which is said to be owned by the company, is not necessarily independent of the government", Pai told the "Handelblatt".
The US has been given evidence that government employees are being placed within the company.
Chemical factory burns in northern France: schools closed
At night, residents hear explosions, a gigantic firewall illuminates the sky above a chemical plant in northern France, and the fire is extinguished after hours - but the cleanup could take days.
After a fire at a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, schools and daycare centres in the region remain closed.
In 12 municipalities, the prefecture said that the facilities would not be opened on Friday, and the interior ministry had urged citizens to stay inside as much as possible and not to smoke. No injuries were reported. Farmers and breeders were called to bring their animals inside, protect their food and stop harvesting for now.
The fire was completely extinguished on Thursday evening, the prefecture said, and there is still a risk that after the extinguishment, the smell could spread, the prefecture said on Twitter.
The chemical plant had previously been the site of a gigantic black smoke pillar, and French media reported huge fires and explosions at the Lubrizol oil refinery, a production facility located a few kilometers from the city center.
The factory in Normandy is classified as a Seveso hazardous site under special surveillance, according to authorities.
Pierre-André Durand, prefect of the Normandy region, told BFMTV that no "high toxicity" had been detected in samples at first, but that pollution of the nearby Seine could not be ruled out.
The fire broke out at about 2:40 a.m. on Monday morning, authorities said, but the cause was initially unclear.
French Finance Minister: "Germany must invest now"
The French Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance, Bruno Le Maire, called on Germany to invest more to boost economic growth in the eurozone.
Germany must invest now, the sooner the better", Le Maire said on Thursday evening at the presentation of the French budget for the coming year.
The economy in the eurozone is weakening, the minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation deteriorates before we can make the necessary decisions".
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States is a major step forward.
France has no such room for competition, the Minister added, referring to its high national debt, which is more than 98% of GDP.
In recent years, calls have been made from France to Germany to increase public investment to stimulate the European economy, and in return German politicians have repeatedly called on France to manage its budget deficit.
The French budget for 2020 presented on Thursday provides for tax relief of more than nine billion euros for households.
The French government is responding to the protests of the Yellow Vest movement, which is expected to reduce the new debt to 2.2%, compared with the expected 3.1%.
Does he still try to trick?: Johnson avoids the question of Brexit tactics
The British Prime Minister Johnson has been a vocal critic of the capitulation law passed by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law mandating the British Prime Minister to avoid a chaos Brexit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another loophole.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been shrouded in doubt as to whether he wants to enforce an unregulated Brexit - despite the latest law passed by Parliament, which is exactly what is to be prevented.
The law requires the government to request a delay of the withdrawal date if no agreement is reached with the EU by mid-October.
Former British Prime Minister John Major on Thursday expressed suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political bullying" to circumvent the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedural trick that would delay the law's entry into force until after leaving the EU. Johnson said he was seeking a deal with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Johnson's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, said he saw the political debate over Brexit as a "walk in the park" and was confident that the EU exit was still possible: "We enjoy it, we will win, we will leave, no worries", Cummings told Telegraph at a book launch.
Cummings, who led the Brexit vote-leaving campaign during the 2016 EU referendum campaign, is now serving as chief strategist at Downing Street, the UK government's headquarters, and is said to be behind the uncompromising policies that have put the prime minister in a seemingly hopeless situation.
The Polaroid Diaries by Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Janis Joplin -- they all stood in front of the camera of Linda McCartney, who has become one of the great rock photographers of all time. But it doesn't always have to be the great glamour.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda from 1969 until her death in 1998, was visibly proud and moved when he presented the picture book "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
After the launch event, McCartney wrote on Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting look into the life of an extraordinary family from the pre-Instagram era, a celebration of Linda McCartney's legacy as a dedicated artist and the instant magic of Polaroid film".
Linda McCartney, who studied art history at Aizona University until she found photography, had the camera always on her hands, thousands of Polaroids she made, some hundreds of which are now being published for the first time in The Polaroid Diaries.
It's portraits, still lifes, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen, and other interiors from the early 1970s to the late 1990s. "She wanted real moments", writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his foreword.
He dances with his daughter Mary on his shoulders, calls in a bathing suit with a bag on his head, or wears shabby moonboots. Sure, the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but they also lived a very normal life beyond the spotlight on their farm in Southland or Scotland.
Like no other medium, the Poloraid camera captures the immediate moment, and the images of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they're much more than just snapshots.
It's about the crucial click: you have to recognize when a great photo is happening in front of you. And then you have to clip it at the right moment", Paul McCartney said. "If you clip it two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo". And Linda would have had the gift to always capture the right moment. "She just knew she had it", Paul said in the Eshun essay.
The light, the composition, the cut and the colours are all right, and what makes The Polaroid Diaries not only a fun picture book for Beatles fans, but also an anecdotal, aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes can sometimes look like abstract paintings, the perfect addition to the Beatles' newly released album Abbey Road, which was released exactly 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to continue importing oil and gas from its neighboring country despite US sanctions against Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey cannot stop importing oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there", Erdogan said in New York, where he had attended the UN General Assembly.
Erdogan, however, admitted that Turkey had problems importing Iranian oil because some companies had "withdrawn because of US threats".
Nevertheless, Turkey will "continue our relations with Iran, especially on this and many other issues", said the Turkish president, who has repeatedly criticized US sanctions against Iran in the past.
The United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" on the Islamic Republic since its withdrawal from the international nuclear agreement with Iran.
Their sanctions have led to a decline in Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran.
US government wants to limit refugee admission
The U.S. government wants to drastically limit the admission of refugees. The U.S. State Department said on Thursday that the annual ceiling for a resettlement program should be lowered from 30,000 to 18,000 refugees at the moment, which is an average of 40 percent.
The State Department said that while the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees, its most important task was to protect and serve U.S. citizens, as the U.S. immigration system is currently overwhelmed.
The US government wants to focus on the reception of two groups of refugees in the future: people persecuted for their faith and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and are thus at risk, as the State Department's statement shows.
The 1980 program, which was set up to select refugees from UN camps around the world and resettle them in the United States, would be the lowest in the program's history, with the current limit of 30,000 being a low. When former US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, left the White House, the number was almost 85,000.
Aid organizations reacted in horror to the announced lowering of the upper border. "This is a very sad day for America", said International Rescue Committee head David Miliband, adding that the United States would further undermine its leadership in protecting the world's most vulnerable people.
Trump is trying to strictly limit immigration to the United States - legal and illegal - and the U.S. government is expecting 350,000 asylum applications for the coming fiscal year, separate from the resettlement program.
Donald Trump - "Close to a whim"
US President Donald Trump has accused whistleblowers of espionage, and whoever gave evidence to the whistleblower accusing him of abuse of power "is close to a trick", Trump said at a private event in New York on Thursday, according to multiple US media reports.
So Trump was speaking to staff at the U.S. mission to the United Nations, and when asked about the person who was reporting to the whistleblower about controversial White House events, he said, "It's almost like a trick". And Trump added, "You know what we did in the old days when we were smart? Right.
Observers have assessed the latter as a possible reference to the death penalty. Democrats have sharply criticized Trump's statements and accused him of intimidating witnesses. It is also an attempt to impede a congressional investigation into a possible impeachment proceedings against him, the chairmen of the House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees wrote.
The whistleblower accuses the president of abusing his office to ask for interference from another country in the 2020 US election, including his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Selensky in the summer, in which Trump urged him to investigate his potential democratic challenger Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower himself is and who his informant is, but the New York Times reports that the whistleblower is an analyst for the CIA.
Refugee boat docked: baby and toddler drowned in the Aegean
People are trying to cross the Aegean from Turkey to Greece again and again, often by the way of the often too small boats, and seven migrants have now died in the sinking of a tube boat, including five children.
The Greek coast guard reported that seven migrants died in the sinking of a tugboat off the Greek island of Chios, including a baby and four other children, and that four children, three women and five men were rescued from the flood by the crew of a passing ferry.
The migrants had left Turkey in the morning, trying to reach the small island group of Inousses in the northeast of the island of Chios, which lies between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
The country of origin of the migrants is unknown, but hundreds of migrants from Turkey are now moving to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean, mostly in far too small boats. Last year, 174 people died on this route, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
The Who are cancelling the concert
A US rock band The Who concert ended in a blackout due to the impasse of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of a performance on Wednesday evening (local time) in Houston, his voice failed the service.
Lead guitarist Pete Townsend apologized, adding that Daltrey "can't really talk right now". Townsend promised the audience to come to his expense at a reunion concert.
The Who have announced that they will be cancelling their scheduled dates for Friday in Dallas and Sunday in Denver, but that they will be picked up at a later date. 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only remaining founding members.
Rental abruptly stopped: WeWork shakes real estate markets
In New York, WeWork has risen to the largest office building in the world.
Within a few years, WeWork has grown from a small startup to the driving force in the world's most expensive real estate markets, but now the company is in crisis, and landlords have to worry about billions in revenue.
The crisis of office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance in the world's largest real estate markets. The company had recently removed founder Adam Neumann as chief executive, postponed its planned IPO and started selling subsidiaries and values such as the private jet to executives in order to gain financial scope for the coming weeks and months.
WeWork rents large office space on a long-term basis and rents it to members in small units on a short-term basis. These can be individual freelancers, small start-ups or entire divisions of large corporations. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at a breathtaking rate. Last year, the company lost $1.6 billion on sales of $1.8 billion. This year alone, rental costs from renting new large areas are estimated to have risen to $2.5 billion. To limit the loss, the new management is now expected to have taken the brakes of emergency and stopped renting new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now entered into leases for up to 15 years, resulting in more than $40 billion in commitments, and these huge liabilities could become a problem not only for the company itself and its investors, but for entire real estate markets.
According to calculations by economist Dan Alpert of Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, rented nearly 300,000 square feet of office space in the past 24 months. New WeWork contracts alone ensured that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the newly-commerciated space at that time. Without WeWork's expansion, office vacancies in the U.S. metropolis at that time would have increased, as Alpert wrote in Business Insider. Similarly, WeWork in London looks better placed between several dozen offices.
The balance of the real estate market could also shift in the UK capital without further expansion of the aggressive startup, including WeWork, the head tenant of an office building in the financial metropolis bought by the savings fund provider Deka for almost 100 million euros last year.
Many landlords have converted their properties to meet the requirements of WeWork with high investment. If WeWork fails to make its business model profitable soon, the property owners would probably have to write off a portion of the expected billion in revenue. They have not had access to WeWork's already scarce reserves despite the long-term leases. Because the rental of WeWork's individual sites is usually done by each of the subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company is only liable in close boundaries.
Russia has again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian coast guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen, with a total of 262 other hunters arrested over the past few days for fishing in the waters illegally, the Russian FSB told Interfax on Friday.
The Commission has also been working on a number of proposals to improve the quality of life of the fishermen in the North, which are being discussed in the report.
The North Korean fishermen were travelling in Russian waters, where the Russian Coast Guard is patrolling to protect its marine biological resources, according to its own data. During the re-checks, 30,000 tin fish have been discovered.
The Russian Fisheries Authority had not issued any fishing licenses to North Koreans this year, even after complaints from local entrepreneurs.
The head of the Association of Russian Fisheries Companies in the Far Eastern Region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, also recently complained of high environmental damage caused by North Korean fishermen. They were fishing with narrow synthetic nets banned in Russia. They were also used to remove small creatures from the sea.
The Russian authorities have said that three members of the Russian coast guard were wounded in the arrests last week, and that a North Korean man also died of his injuries, according to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first seized a North Korean boat and then a second one after it opened fire.
US imposing a travel ban on former President Castro
The US has imposed an entry ban on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children, which the US State Department cited in a statement on Thursday as alleging Castro's involvement in "grave human rights violations".
As head of the armed forces, the brother of the late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro is also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. "The Cuban regime's disregard for human rights and use of force to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela", US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tweeted.
President Donald Trump on Wednesday issued a travel ban against members of the Venezuelan government and military, among others. Venezuela has been in a bitter power struggle between the government and the opposition for months. The United States has imposed a series of sanctions against Maduro's government to bring him to his knees and help opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaidó to power.
Cuba is considered one of Maduro's closest allies.The socialist Caribbean island receives oil from Venezuela in exchange for the services of dispatched doctors.According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous intelligence agents to Venezuela to help the government suppress government opponents.
New climate protests from Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are again taking to the streets today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement is planning to hold demonstrations in dozens of countries around the world, starting with New Zealand and Australia, before the protests spread across Europe to North America, where climate activist Greta Thunberg wanted to attend a large rally in Montreal, Canada.
The global response to the record-breaking strike this Friday is relatively unclear. Thunberg herself was a good thing. "More than four million people went on strike for climate last Friday.
In Germany, in particular, the number of protesters was very high last Friday. A good third of all the world's protesters - around 1.4 million - had taken part in the protests in 575 German cities, according to estimates by Fridays for Future. This time, according to a list of the movement, demonstrations are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolitan cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or West Germany on Sylt.
Thunberg, who was 15 at the time, had stood before the Swedish parliament in August 2018 to call on her country's politicians to make a stronger commitment to climate protection, which in a short time led to the Fridays for Future movement.
They jointly call for more ambition from the political side in the fight against global warming and the looming climate catastrophe, especially under the Paris climate agreement, which requires global warming to be contained to below 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial times.
Thunberg arrived in New York City just over a month ago after a two-week transatlantic whirlwind race yacht, where she had recently taken part in climate protests and United Nations summits.
Russia bans smoking on the balcony
People in Russia are now banned from smoking on the balcony, which is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking", a spokesman for the emergency department told Tass on Thursday in Moscow.
However, if you smoke, you will be fined 3,000 rubles (42.46 euros). If you smoke a cigarette, the penalty is higher.
Strike against cybercriminals - Detectives lifting servers
In the fight against cybercrime, German investigators have for the first time identified a major server provider for illegal business on the darknet.
A total of 13 perpetrators are suspected of hosting numerous websites through which international criminals operate their operations in a former NATO bunker in Traben-Trarbach, Mosel.
The public prosecutor's office in Koblenz said seven suspects were arrested Thursday night in a major operation.
The suspects' clients include the operators of the world's second largest darknet drug marketplace, Wall Street Market, which investigators had destroyed in the spring.
It was the first time such a host had been set up in Germany, it was said.
The search operation, which was supported by special forces such as the GSG9, was carried out in Germany and neighbouring countries, and was the result of almost five years of investigation.
New global climate protests by Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests to date, thousands of people are again taking to the streets today for more climate protection.
To conclude an international climate strike week, the Fridays for Future movement once again planned actions and rallies in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany, protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including cities such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or West Germany on Sylt.
Climate protests  Who are Thunberg's backers?
Justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoke factories that are warming the climate. So much more amazing is it that a 16-year-old girl is holding the mirror against the powerful of her time. But what is behind it? Is it the willingness to help or the clever marketing of a climate activist?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg moves the masses and moves young people to stand up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not the first time in history that a young person has managed to attract a collection of children and young people for himself. Already in 1212, a child named Nicholas of Cologne felt chosen to advocate for a more just world.
But there's a dark side to this: why does it take a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? In addition, Greta Thunberg has a wealthy PR manager by her side. By the way, her mother published a book that sold well, thanks to her daughter in the spotlight. Even longtime followers of Greta Thunberg were a little offended by the last PR show, or the boat trip was probably too much for some of her followers. This is also not unfounded, because the action in the media was very well received worldwide and a lot of money flows through the action thanks to the imposters.
The question is whether it is morally right to get rich financially in order to save the world, or whether it is still true that certain circles of people work with stockbrokers during the world rescue operation, and no matter what position is ultimately taken, a critical and reflective viewpoint is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy is based on different opinions and discussions.
Comet discovered: Interstellar guest crossing our solar system
A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system.
Astronomers have confirmed their assumptions: A foreign comet is currently crossing our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - For a long time, researchers have only guessed, but now they are certain: a comet from another star is currently crossing through our solar system.
2I/Borisov: Comet discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The body was discovered in Crimea by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borisov, who looked up at the sky with a self-built telescope and further observations confirmed his first suspicion.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to gain close-up insights into a foreign solar system. Apparently the comet is similar to those of our own system, as the Astrophysical Institute of the Canary Islands reports.
The comet was spotted before it arrived and can be observed for months
Unlike its predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been spotted in its approach, meaning it can be observed from Earth for many months. "The object will reach its brightest brightness in mid-December and then be visible with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020", explains Davide Farnocchia of NASA. "Then it will only be visible with larger, professional telescopes until October 2020".
The previous visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumuamua".
First findings about comet 2I/Borisov are raising hope in science
The first findings suggest that the comet is between 2 and 16 kilometres in diameter, and that at the same time the celestial body appears to be similar to our comet - because, as IAC researcher Julia de León put it, the spectrum of the pendulum is similar to ours.
But the observation goes beyond individual knowledge, and the fact that two such objects have already been discovered in just two years may allow a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids keep busy the researchers, and only recently did a giant asteroid run past the Earth and come dangerously close to it.
"Absolutely reprehensible": Rachel Johnson horrified about her brother
Boris Johnson is getting loner, first his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister is lashing out at the prime minister's warlike language as "unsmoking".
"Capitulation", "betrayal", "deal": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is under pressure and is arming himself - at least verbally.
The well-known journalist and author told Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if opponents of an EU exit were to be "hanged, drawn, divided, divided and fed". She considers this highly reprehensible. She does not recognize her brother's version, said Rachel Johnson, who ran for the EU parliament in the election for the anti-Brexit party "Change UK".
She was particularly struck by the mention of her brother Jo Cox, an EU-friendly House Member of Parliament who had been murdered by a neo-Nazi just days before the 2016 Brexit referendum. Their memories can best be honoured by going through Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the House of Commons. "It is very untasty to refer to a member of Parliament who was murdered by someone who shouted 'Britain first,'" Johnson's sister now criticized.
Cox's widow also sharply criticized the prime minister. "It makes me sick when Jos' name is used like this", he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to stand up for what you believe in passionately and decisively - no matter what your opinion is. But you should never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere had developed in which attacks were more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson's younger brother Jo resigned as Secretary of State and his Tory parliamentary term. "I was torn between loyalty to family and national interest in the past few months - it's an insurmountable tension", Jo Johnson said.
The Times reports that all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticize language that is "not worthy of this country". In a joint statement, they stated: "In recent days, language has been unacceptable, both in debates and outside parliament. We should speak with respect".
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez performing at the Super Bowl
The NFL is making a strong mark in its 100th year of existence: in the halftime show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women with Latino roots will perform promising "a burst of fun and energy".
Latina Power at the Super Bowl: Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will be hosting the semi-final of the upcoming NFL NFL season, organizers announced on Thursday (local time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humbled to represent the Latino community in the United States alongside JLo, because she has an incredible strength in the United States", Shakira shared in a video.
The American Football League final, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, will be held on February 2 in Miami. In the southernmost city of Florida, many people with Latin American roots live. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is of Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl is putting two women on stage this time - and two Latinas", Lopez explained. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world.
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents emigrated from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s, she landed big hits with songs like "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later also released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actress and is seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas from November.
Shakira became known in Colombia as a telenovela star and singer. She made her worldwide breakthrough in 2001 with her first bilingual album and single "Whenever, Wherever".
The announcement of the half-time guests is eagerly awaited in the United States every time. This year many are also considering the election as a political gesture. After all, the country is deeply divided, not least by President Donald Trump's immigration policy.
The Super Bowl is the largest US sports event and a huge promotional show. Musicians such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones have caused a sensation there.
Last year, there was a political controversy in the lead up to the dispute over quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to rise up in protest against police violence against blacks and was harshly treated by US President Donald Trump for his actions.
An actor and youtuber has agreed with Egypt's ruler, but Mohamed Ali prefers to stay abroad.
The two men who have an influence on whether blood is flowing in Egypt's streets have both spent the past week abroad. One of them floated back into Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former general, who deposed Muslim Brother Mohammed Morsi, the country's first freely elected head of state, in 2013, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had vowed to take action against political Islam and not lost a penny over the human rights abuses on the Nile - in a week in which Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people for waiting to lead to protests against the president.
To mislead - this is what the president thinks the other man who is currently controlling the streets is trying to do. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, avoiding the access of security forces who would arrest him immediately if he tried to enter Egyptian soil.
He addresses the head of state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are starving, the president is starving in luxury and building magnificent new palaces, it is said. The army leadership on which Sisi bases his rule accuses Ali of corruption and enrichment. Because he did business with these very gentlemen for 15 years in his second career as a contractor, he seems to know quite precisely what he is talking about - at least that is the impression of many Egyptians, as the almost exploding click-through numbers show.
After thousands of people demonstrated against Sisis's rule for the first time since he took power last week and nearly 2,000 citizens, including prominent civil society figures, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. It was unlikely that so many people would actually take to the streets. But there were some small protests, such as in Giseh near Cairo and in Kina near Luxor. Videos on social media showed protests in which participants accused Al-Sisi of corruption and demanded his departure.
In the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where protesters tore apart banners with the portrait of the president last week, there was a massive police presence on Friday. Security forces set up checkpoints in the city and on the deadlines. In Cairo, several subway stations in the city centre were closed for "maintenance", most streets around Tahrir Square, the heart of the 2011 revolution, were blocked. And in the Raqqa square where supporters of the overthrown Muslim Brotherhood held Mursi until the army set them on fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was taken to prevent unrest from happening: the Sisba Party wanted to hold a grand rally for the president in 2013.
Mohamed Ali made these arrangements to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be Tahrir Square", Ali said in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let's not clash with police officers". But as a backlash, this is not to be understood: "All of Egypt is Tahrir Square".
If the provider promises too much service
If the Internet connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are different testing options.
When you sign an Internet contract, you don't have to blindly trust the speed data of the vendors.
Finally, the transfer rates promised in advance are part of the contract and should therefore be achieved, according to the Bavarian Consumer Centre.
If the connection always seems to be much slower than advertised by the provider, there are various test options, such as the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measuring tools, which measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
'However, the tests of providers are carried out according to specifications and are therefore not uniform and objective', the consumer centre Bavaria notes.
If the connection is much slower than announced, customers can give the provider a reasonable period of 14 days, usually, to deliver the promised service.
If this does not work even after multiple requests, customers can resign and may even claim damages.
First ranking Republican to investigate
As the first high-ranking Republican, the governor of Vermont has spoken out for an impeachment inquiry against US President Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important, yes, and where this leads from here is determined by the facts that are being established", Phil Scott said at a news conference on Thursday.
Scott said he was not surprised by revelations that Trump repeatedly asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the interventions of Democratic presidential candidate and former vice president Joe Biden in Ukraine, because Trump has been watching Biden "for years".
Republicans have so far held back from criticizing Trump over the whistleblower affair; few have expressed discomfort over it. Scott's remarks are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already repeatedly opposed Trump's policies, such as easing environmental regulations and tightening immigration regulations.
Spider-Man stays in the MCU: Another Marvel movie planned
It was a shock to all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August, it was announced that Sony and Marvel would be going their separate ways. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would no longer be part of the Avengers universe.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home. Several US media reports agree. Accordingly, the film's release date should be fixed: in the US, the film is scheduled to open on July 16, 2021.
In Screenrant magazine, Marvel boss Kevin Feige is quoted as saying, "I'm excited that Spidey's journey in the MCU is being continued. I and everyone at Marvel Studios are very excited that we can continue working on it... he's the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes, as Sony continues to work on its Spidey version. You never know what the future will bring".
But what's with the sudden good news? Sony reportedly made an offer to Marvel, and industry magazines say that Disney, which is also Marvel's, would contribute 30 percent to the revenue of upcoming Spider-Man movies.
This is how Duchess Meghan and Prince Harry appear in the "Suits" finale.
After nine seasons, the series "Suits" in the United States has now reached the grand finale. In the last episode there were many happy endings and as many cameo appearances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, were charmingly paid tribute.
One thing to keep in mind: Duchess Meghan did not return to the final as Rachel Zane for a final farewell, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some of the flashbacks showed once again the most memorable scenes with the Duchess of today, like the moments of her failed and happy wedding with Mike or how she greets him after his sentence is over.
But her real husband, Prince Harry, was also mentioned in the "Suits" finale, of course in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) steps straight towards the altar to marry his fiancée Sheila (Rachael Harris, 51) Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a controversial comment about the dress.
Aegean: Baby and four other children drowned in a boat accident
A baby and four other children drowned while anchoring a refugee boat in the Aegean Sea, killing seven people in total, the Greek coast guard said on Friday.
The boat sank near the Greek island of Inousses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Hundreds of migrants are now crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands in the eastern Aegean Sea, where 174 people died last year, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wanted to "find out what the refugee situation is like" in Turkey, Seehofer said on Friday.
A spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed Seehofers' planned trip with EU Home Affairs Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Home Minister Christophe Castaner on Friday.
The Greek authorities have also confirmed that the number of migrants arriving from Turkey is still unusual, with 654 arriving on the Greek islands on Tuesday alone, the Greek Ministry of Civil Protection said on Wednesday.
Is the Turkey deal still working?
The increase in numbers has raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey agreement, which was concluded in 2016, which provides that the EU can send back all refugees and migrants who come to the Greek islands illegally through Turkey.
The Greek authorities have been very active in the process of processing asylum applications, but the Greek authorities are finding it difficult to process asylum applications because of a shortage of staff.
The number of refugees in Turkey has been higher than in any other country since the EU-Turkey refugee pact entered into force in March 2016, state broadcaster Rondfunk reported.
Climate change: Heat is leading to more heart attacks
According to doctors, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "completely certain" to be one of the biggest challenges to the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, said Andreas Zeiher, president of the German Society for Cardiology.
Green politician must be held accountable for embarrassing photo shoot
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the campaign, was the cup manipulated for this reason?
The head of the Canadian Green Party is holding a multi-way cup in a photo, but now it turns out that the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It went unnoticed for quite a while - and finally caught on. The reusable coffee cup with metal straw never held by Elizabeth May, the leader of the Canadian Greens. On the party website she was seen in a photo with this cup, talking to citizens. However, the photo had been published before and also circulated to the media - and then the cup was still a snowy (Papp) cup, as the Canadian National Post reported.
Green chief must answer for the photo shoot
The National Post then accused May of manipulation and that the party was producing fake news to appear more credible on the topic of "environmental protection", amid a campaign for the House of Commons, where Trudeau is also increasingly struggling over a bribery scandal.
The photo went viral on social media and sparked a discussion about fake news. One user shared a comparison of the photos and wrote, "The Greens are manipulating a photo of their presidents to hide their inside information".
May was shocked and insisted on her blog that she knew nothing about the action. To emphasize this, she immediately posted the original: she was talking to citizens, holding a cup. However, she correctly put it, it was made of bamboo. She always had it. A party spokeswoman said that it was only to house the logo part in the picture, not to cover up anything.
May writes that she feels sorry for the employee who did this. "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide", she tells the Guardian, and at the same time asks herself something from her overworked team: "If they ever want to edit a picture again, can they not do something with my face to make me look younger?"
The German Greens have also been in a shitstorm because of their use of disposable plastic or their flying - but their pictures were not photographed.
Influencer wants free upgrade: lifetime ban on Cathay
Jaqueline Ng was reportedly promised an upgrade by mail from Cathay Pacific, but when she asked for it at check-in, she was not allowed on board and was never allowed to fly with Cathay again.
Sometimes they're lucky, and the check-in staff offers a free Economy Class transfer.
This case, however, shows how not to: A self-proclaimed influencer actively asked Cathay Pacific Airlines for a free upgrade. On Instagram, over 65,000 users follow Jaqueline Ng.
While on the flight, the staff refused to upgrade Jaqueline, despite her showing an email that her Cathay Pacific allegedly offered an upgrade. The letter claims the influencer received from a marketing employee at the airline.
On the return flight, Jaqueline tried again to get an upgrade for the long haul flight. This time, the woman reportedly submitted the same email, but with a different reference number. The staff at JFK Airport were skeptical: they were hacking at headquarters. And in fact, the employee from whom the email allegedly came is said to have denied contact with Jaqueline.
The airline staff at the airport cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and imposed a lifetime ban on Cathay Pacific, forcing her to buy a new plane ticket to Taiwan for $1,400 (about $1,280).
With her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a consumer advocacy firm, because Cathay had refunded her the price of her original ticket, but Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
But as long as Jaqueline doesn't submit the metadata of the mail, the case remains clear: for Cathay, the influencer has committed fraud, she remains blocked from future flights. The airline's terms and conditions also state that she doesn't have to pay for the new flight.
Oil prices fall according to the report on the ceasefire in Yemen
Oil prices fell by more than a dollar in the shortest time since Friday afternoon, with the last time a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea variety Brent costing $61.83 - about 1.4 percent less than the day before. The price of a barrel of the American variety West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropped 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The Wall Street Journal reported on a ceasefire in Yemen that Saudi Arabia has agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A drone strike on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia had shut down five percent of global oil production in mid-September. Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in the civil war-torn country of Yemen had claimed responsibility for the attacks. Saudi Arabia holds Iran responsible as does the US government. A ceasefire would ease political tension in the region.
If a deal is actually reached, we can focus on growth and demand concerns, said Ole Hansen, head of raw materials strategy at the Saxo Bank of Bloomberg News Agency.
The price of oil continues to decline in recent days, as a week ago, a barrel of WTI oil was still up to almost $59 and Brent was up to almost $65.
Recently, Bloomberg reported on insider reports that after the September attack, oil repair work in Saudi Arabia was progressing faster than expected, with production volume once again reaching eight million barrels per day and moving back towards the original volume.
Recently, there have been several press releases citing insiders reporting on rapid progress by state oil company Saudi Aramco in repairs, but raw materials experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently planning to go public and avoid negative headlines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is on its way to leave the port more than two months after being seized by Iran and recently granted permission.
However, the US announced that it would move Iranian defense missiles and soldiers to Saudi Arabia, and fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries like the US and the UK has temporarily driven oil prices up significantly in recent weeks.
The accusations against Trump are getting stronger
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, accusations of cover-up against the White House have been made public. Several senior government officials have made an intense effort to prevent access to the wording of the conversation after a controversial phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Selensky at the end of July. An anonymous whistleblower explained this.
North Korea considers the third summit of Trump and Kim to be questionable
North Korea has expressed doubts that a third summit between Kim Jong-un and US President Donald Trump will soon be held in the nuclear dispute, and the meaning and prospects for success of such a meeting are questionable because of lack of progress in implementing agreements at the first summit in Singapore, top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan said on Friday, according to KCNA.
The North Korean Foreign Ministry adviser said the US had done nothing to implement the decisions of the summit last year, and he also criticized the US sanctions and the joint US-South Korean military maneuvers, but hoped for a "wise" and "brave" decision by Trump to bring the rapprochement back.
Trump said on Monday he wanted to know what a third summit with Kim would bring before he could make any preparations. Negotiations on disarmament of North Korea's nuclear and missile programs have stalled since the failed second summit between Trump and Kim in Hanoi in February.
Prince Harry: Weapons manufacturers to help with mine clearance
In a blue split vest, Prince Harry of England symbolically set off and destroyed an explosive mine in Angola. Near a camp of the British Halo Trust near the town of Dirico, he set up the firing circle. In a safe distance, the explosive exploded. With a view to getting Angola mine-free by 2025, he later called on all the countries whose names are on these weapons but have not helped to clear the way to commit to help.
Pound under pressure - Interest rate cut expected
British pound under pressure
In the face of a rapid decline in interest rates, the pound is losing value against the euro.
Speculation that the Bank of England (BoE) will soon cut interest rates has led to a sharp drop in the pound sterling, which on Friday fell by 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
The sales were triggered by statements by central banker Michael Saunders, who spoke of a rate cut even if a chaotic Brexit could be avoided, as uncertainty would affect the UK economy for the foreseeable future.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the economic impact of the Brexit hack without directly signalling a rate cut.
More: The British prime minister has taken a high risk with his provocations, but it could pay off, says Kerstin Leitel, editor of Handelsblatt.
Doping: Other Russian manipulations proven
Material from the Moscow analytical laboratory is being manipulated, David Howman, former director of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and current head of integrity at the World Athletics Federation, confirms.
At the start of the World Championships in Athletics, new details about the doping scandal in Russia are coming to light - and they destroy the little credibility that Russian sport had gained at the beginning of the year and even only a few times. In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Lab finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
In December 2014, a systematic fraud in Russian sports was revealed. The WADA banned the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee, after individual testing, allowed about 270 athletes of the country to compete in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio under a neutral flag, at the Winter Games in February 2018, 168 Russian athletes were at the start.
The Commission has not yet published any positive findings.
The following September, the Wada lifted the Rusada ban, but requested access to the laboratory and the samples, which were intended to provide information on the extent of cover-up of doping cases in state doping, and to help punish athletes subsequently.
"Yes, we received the data nine months ago. We should check that the task force received the correct data", David Howman told the Frankfurt Daily on Friday. "We found numerous discrepancies between the data Wada received from a whistleblower and those it received from the Russians in January". Many positive findings were missing, which were mentioned in the McLaren report.
The World Cup is not affected
This confirms the IAAF's position: the Athletics Federation is the only organization banned by Russia. At the World Championships in Doha, 30 Russian athletes will be competing under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
Earlier this week, Wada had already put manipulations in place and urged Russia to respond to the allegations within three weeks. Russia now threatens to re-block Rusada and, worst case, exclude it from the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
