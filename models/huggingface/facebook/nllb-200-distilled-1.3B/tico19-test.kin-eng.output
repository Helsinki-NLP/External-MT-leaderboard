The overall number of new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) increased rapidly in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The overall number of new cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom shows that, although rates vary from country to country, the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience in Italy, states, hospitals and intensive care units should be better prepared to handle the large number of COVID-19 patients who will require care, especially in the intensive care unit.
On 31 December 2019, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced that you had been infected with a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Current evidence suggests that about 80% of people who are infected with COVID-19 develop mild illness, i.e. respiratory illness with or without pneumonia, and most recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 causes severe illness requiring hospitalization, while in the remaining 6% of cases, it causes severe illness requiring intensive care.
The overall hospital death rate from COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we analyzed the overall COVID-19 infection rate in each country in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom and compared it to that in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the number of current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with that in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 has continued to spread to other countries and the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak in other parts of the world is similar in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and colleagues reported the number of first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe based on WHO patient definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020 in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), resulting in 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between this date and 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Determine the overall number of COVID-19 cases and its overall spread
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the country-by-country COVID-19 case figures are reported worldwide, provided by only reliable sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, updated daily at 8:00.
This data was used to assess the current COVID-19 case numbers in the EU/EEA and the UK, and to compare them to those in Italy.
To provide a snapshot of the current COVID-19 case numbers, we have aggregated COVID-19 case numbers over 14 days, and therefore focused on the normal transmission of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the number of cases reported by each country as of 15 March 2020 at 8:00 compared to Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Current COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
The overall 14 day COVID-19 case stability in EU/EEA and UK was broadly similar to that in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
Overall in the EU/EEA and the UK, COVID-19 cases started to rise around 21 February and then spiked around 28 February 2020 (Additional note).
This was mainly due to the sharp increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but also in all other EU/EEA countries and the UK where there has been an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases (Additional note).
Figure 2 shows an estimate of the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries and in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had reported a total number of cases equal to or less than that of Italy in the preceding 3 weeks.
Our findings suggest that the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will increase rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Changes in the overall COVID-19 case numbers suggest that the epidemic is spreading at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries may have different testing standards, healthcare practices may vary, and the definition of cases may vary from country to country and there may be different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing those who have not been tested.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected areas of Italy reported that up to 10% of COVID-19 cases required intensive care and media reports indicated that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached a maximum capacity.
Data on COVID-19 hospitalizations or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level at only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not reported).
However, it must be accurately collected to provide data on current patients focusing on reported cases and deaths.
A 201011 study found that intensive care units and minimally invasive units were available in varying sizes across Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer facilities than Italy (they had less than 12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 201011).
The sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Review of COVID-19 Challenges provides examples of overcrowding, accompanied by estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country with COVID-19 hospitalization rates above 90% of the number of ICU beds.
Since some regions of the EU/EEA and UK are currently the most frequent cases, and hospitals and intensive care units usually receive patients from a specific region, data on cases and intensive care beds should be available at the NUTS-2 statistical level.
The situation in Italy and other countries suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the continuing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the community and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases requiring care, especially in the intensive care unit, as is the case in the affected areas of Italy.
As noted in a recent ECDC Rapid Crisis Review, it is important to use a rapid and early intervention approach to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, and thus to replace home confinement with preventive measures, as the expected increase in the number of cases may leave decision makers and hospital administrators with little time to analyze, agree on and implement appropriate measures if not taken early.
A rapid problem assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the outbreak.
There are few opportunities for countries to step up their measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on healthcare.
If this is not done, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a significant number of serious cases in the coming days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 strain of the novel coronavirus, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, making it a humanitarian disaster.
Like another similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by ticks and has similarly-similar symptoms.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less lethal than SARS, although it is more transmissible and more common in older adults than in younger people and more common in men than women.
In view of the increasing number of reports on this novel disease, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive and useful review of this increasingly researched topic.
We focus on the basic issues of disease awareness, its causes, the virus that causes it, how it is diagnosed, treated, spread and prevented.
Although there are still many questions to be answered, we hope that this study will help to identify and eliminate this life-threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 has already set a record in which all Chinese were required to stay home for the entire holiday and several weeks afterwards due to the new virus outbreak.
The virus has many similarities to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003; the World Health Organization (WHO) designated it SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020, and the disease derived from it is now known as CoV 19 Disease (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and then spread throughout the country and to about 50 other countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed, of which more than 40,000 had been discharged and more than 3,000 had died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is a "general enemy of the first order" and that it can be more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles on COVID-19 have been published, including on the virus that causes it, its pathogenesis, origin, diagnosis and treatment since the first report was published on 7 January 2020 describing the viral patterns that had been detected in a variety of patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research already done on this new and highly researched topic.
Whenever possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV-borne diseases, such as the Middle East flu (MERS, identified in 2012).
We will review the lessons learned so far on preventing and identifying the causes of the disease and some of the urgent unanswered questions.
CoVs, which are generally considered non-lethal viruses, are the primary cause of the four most common types of influenza at about 15%.
However, in this century, we have seen two highly contagious human CoVs, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to many other countries with countless infections and deaths.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1 of Figure 1.1, the first case of pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 and was reported to the National Health Commission of China.
The first document describing the CoV's structure was published seven days later.
The first death in Wuhan was reported on 15 January 2020.
Meanwhile, the outbreak spread rapidly to other cities, provinces and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, it was announced that some doctors were infected, making it clear that people can be infected with the virus.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under quarantine and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical investigation of the disease reported that, of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had been to the seafood market in Wuhan, where the infection was thought to have originated from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries worldwide (Figure (Figure 2).2).
Given the rapid spread of the epidemic, it is difficult to predict its extent and impact.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-institutional study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 positive COVID-19 patients provided a more updated picture of the current status of the outbreak available on the website (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People infected with SARS-CoV-2 are of varying ages, but are most commonly between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years old, few under 20, and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
Men are more likely to have SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread mainly in Hubei and surrounding areas.
On average, it takes approximately 5 days (2-9 days) from the time of COVID-19 diagnosis to the time of diagnosis.
It took an average of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) for symptoms to develop.
The average time of death for the first case was 9.5 (4.8-13) days after the first case was detected.
The baseline risk factor (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 for the bullet was 2.23-4.82.
The number of new cases peaked before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the peak of travel before the Spring Festival in China.
The confirmed infection rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the overall mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe asthma.
CoVs are a family of large, single-stranded RNA-containing virus.
They can be classified into four types, alpha, beta, gamma and delta.In this category, alpha and beta CoVs are the most susceptible to infection in humans.
The head (S) glycoprotein binds to ACE2 and DPP4 receptors in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then binds to the cells.
The viral RNA genome is isolated and incorporated into the cell; once the viral genome is replicated, the genome RNA, together with the glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, makes the molecular sequences that bind to the plasma cells into the virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was identified on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel beta-CoV with a 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 genotypes collected at the outbreak site of Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 has a greater genetic similarity to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
In an electron microscope to measure infectivity, SARS-CoV-2 fragments were detected in severely deformed areas of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human ACE2 gene was identified as the most common in SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 expression at a much slower rate than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 is less transmissible to patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also be a novel short protein produced by orf3b and a novel protein produced by orf8.
The orf3b protein in SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral infectivity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 protein does not have any known specificity or conditions.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou and colleagues reported on the cryomicroscopic electron microscopy (Cry-EM) model of a complete human ACE2 enzyme at a density of 2.9 Å in the B0AT1 amino acid chain.
They found that the region, which has both open and closed forms, is composed of two molecules and that the ACE2-B0AT1 region can bind to two S proteins, which is a marker of CoV infection.
B0AT1 may be included in the testing of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
The animal from which the infection was first transmitted
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were later transmitted to humans by bats and camels.
By comparing the SARS-CoV-2 and other CoVs, bats were identified as the source of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs derived from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the first animal that infected the virus enabled it to infect a variety of species until it infected humans is unknown, and the mode of transmission is not well understood.
Ji and colleagues suggested that snakes may have transmitted the virus to humans through the introduction of the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that mosquitoes, long-beaked, venomous mammals widely used by traditional Chinese medicine, may have been the first infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to a 99% genetic similarity found in mosquito CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference in the two genomes is still large; therefore, conclusive evidence is awaited (Figure 33).
Many of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses can survive 48 hours in a hot environment and up to 5 days in a temperature of less than 20 °C and humidity of between 40% and 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be resistant to sunlight and temperatures of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing detergents, peroxyacetic acid, chloroform, and other oily liquids, but not corregicin, can kill the virus effectively.
In general, the general population is not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, there are no major studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we only use previous studies on other CoVs, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
In general, once the virus has entered the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system through the presence of a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) that includes regulin-like C receptors, TLR receptors, NLR receptors and RLR receptors.
In a variety of ways, the virus causes fever, inflammation of the host cells, and the accumulation of type I antigen (IFN) proteins that are produced to slow viral spread and re-feed the pathogen.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV may help the virus to become immune to it.
After a short time, the immune system begins to fight the virus.
T cells include CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which play important roles in immune response.
CD4+ T cells activate B cells to produce antibodies that are able to fight the virus, and then CD8+ T cells kill the virus-infected cells.
Helper T cells produce inflammatory cytokines to help protect cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell function and cause T cell death.
The immunity of the fluid containing synapses such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also important in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies removed from a recovered patient have deactivated MERS-CoV.
Furthermore, excessive immune defenses lead to a large number of foreign cells that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, which can lead to organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2, which was identified in early cases, is more common in older people with a variety of other medical conditions and in pregnant women.
People with high viral load or poor immune function are often at higher risk of infection.
The average duration of SARS-CoV-2 in the body before symptoms appear is between 1 and 14 days, with the most common being between 3 and 7 days based on a study of 425 early cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the time taken for symptoms to appear was 3 days in general and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as mentioned above, showed that the time to onset of symptoms was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 patients.
It is important that health authorities set appropriate quarantine times based on the actual time it takes for symptoms to be most apparent, thus preventing infected asymptomatic individuals from infecting others.
Normally, people who have been exposed to or have been infected with the virus are required to quarantine for 14 days.
What if the quarantine period is extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first major symptom of COVID-19, and may be either alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as a cough, shortness of breath, joint pain, wheezing, headache, sore throat, frequent colds, chest pain, diarrhea, diarrhea and vomiting.
Some patients had difficulty breathing or low oxygen levels within a week of the onset of the disease.
Severe patients developed severe respiratory problems, low blood pressure, acid reflux and hypertension.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if they do not have a pulmonary problem, should be tested for the virus early.
A case-control study conducted in late December 2019 showed a 98% correlation for fever, 76% for whooping cough, 55% for oxygen problems and 3% for diarrhea; 8% for patients who requested a ventilator.
Similar conclusions were drawn in two recent studies of hereditary and asymptomatic transmission.
Similar to this study, a 2012 case study showed that MERS-CoV patients also developed fever (98%), a cough (47%) and oxygen deficiency (55%) as primary symptoms.
However, 80% of them requested respirators more than COVID-19 patients and the mortality rate is higher for MERS than for COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also reported in MERS patients.
Among SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), whooping cough (29%-75%), oxygen deficiency (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were reported to be the most severe symptoms with patients requiring a ventilator having a reported incidence of about 14%-20%.
On 14 February, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% when the global confirmed cases were 66,576.
As with this virus, the mortality rate from SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases in November 2002.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 case study, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies have shown that the baseline infectivity (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, the 95% infectivity (CI) was 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 to MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 are shown in Table 1.1.
The above statistics suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more transmissible than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has a lower mortality rate than the others.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is much more effective than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV pandemics.
Translators are often seen in the same family or group or vehicle as the boat they travel in.
Patients usually have traveled to or lived in Wuhan or other affected areas or have had contact with infected or sick people in the two weeks prior to their diagnosis.
However, it has been shown that people can live with the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who recover and are discharged from hospital may still have the virus, suggesting the need for an extension of the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or low white blood cell count (especially white blood cells) in the first few days.
For example, the lowest number of white blood cells is 4×109/L including 1×109/L of cells, and high levels of ASPARAT aminotransferase (AST) and viral load have been observed in 1 099 COVID-19 patients.
Blood levels of erythrocytes and platelets increased in some patients, and accumulations of erythrocyte-producing proteins and erythroiditis increased in many patients.
In severe patients, the level of D-dima, a metabolite of fibrin, was elevated, and the cell count decreased.
Problems with chest tube transplants are common in many COVID-19 patients and are characterized by either side-on blisters or a visible obstruction (OBE) of the lungs.
Patients often develop abnormal pressure, ulcers in the lungs and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), fever, accumulation of fluid and pulmonary edema are major disruptors of oxygenation.
The dysfunction of pinemosites of type I and II reduces the amount of cells that reduce the spacing between the droplets and increases the replication rate of the organs, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of pulmonary failure.
Therefore, negative chest X-ray results are often associated with a higher severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, a preliminary analysis of the cause of COVID-19 identified pinemositis, pulmonary artery inflammation, a collagen-containing cell wall in the respiratory tract, and a high concentration of connective tissue in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which was consistent with the origin of viral infection and severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and was similar to that in SARS and MERS patients.
Identification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using laboratory-based RT-PCR was used as a primary target in the COVID-19 test.
However, due to the high rate of false positive results, which can contribute to the spread of the disease, the test became available for diagnostic use (not just RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
This was also the case with the SARS test.
Therefore, combining medical history, symptoms, laboratory tests and scan results is important and necessary to make an accurate diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team led by Feng Zhang described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects RNA replication fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at levels of 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of input) using a mavutta sample in less than an hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new approach could significantly improve its efficacy if tested in clinical trials.
Due to the unfamiliarity of the new CoV, physicians may initially be in close proximity to COVID-19 patients while they test various drugs that are being offered or desired prior to treating other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These include medications that are used or can be used in combination with antiviral medications, immunosuppressants, anti-inflammatory drugs, plasma extracts from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychiatric therapy.
It is recommended that a plasma extracted from healthy patients be used to treat the virus.
Pharmaceutical companies are working on it to develop antibodies and vaccines that are resistant to the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and may then also target, to a lesser extent, other organs that produce ACE2 as a cell wall and the kidneys.
However, malfunction and inactivity of the respiratory system are major health risks and leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygenation, high-level oxygenation, low-level ventilation and ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms should be treated with ECMO, a replacement for cardiopulmonary resuscitation used to treat patients with severe heart or respiratory problems.
Furthermore, the maintenance of renal function, prevention and treatment of other diseases and hypoglycemia, and maintenance of vital organ function also benefit patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that elevated cytokines are caused by an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine proliferation is a pattern of innate immune response characterized by the expression of various cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release a large number of foreign cells and are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is useful in treating cytokine hypertension, especially in patients with severe disease.
Corticosteroids and tosislizumab, a single-chromosome antibody that is anti-IL6, have been used to treat cytokine hypertension.
Other immunosuppressive drugs for the treatment of cytokine hypertension include immunosuppressants that target T cells; inhibit IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibit JAK; birinatomabe; reduce cytokine 4 signaling; and HDAC inhibitors.
Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as anti-immune drugs, have been widely used to treat SARS to reduce the severity of the immune response.
However, taking multiple anti-inflammatory drugs had no effect on lung ulcers that developed into severe ulcers in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Rather, it can cause serious complications, particularly osteoarthritis (AVN), which has a significant impact on the treatment of disease.
However, it is recommended that low doses of corticosteroids be given to patients with severe COVID-19 in a short-term and conservative manner.
At the time of writing, the virus had been detected in a single individual.
However, injections of remdesivir, a nucleotide-like substance, have been shown to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marlburg virus infections.
Subsequently, remdesivir was shown to inhibit other RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on the above, Gilead provided the drug to China for two studies on SARS-CoV-2 infected humans, which are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been shown to be effective in treating patients with symptoms of severe respiratory distress.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, dark circles and other serious complications may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interactions between these medications and other medications used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma was removed from patients who recovered with immunosuppression.
The collection of blood from people who have recovered from an infectious disease for the treatment of others with the same disease or to prevent the transmission of the disease to people who are not sick has been practiced for a long time.
Yes, healthy patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to the virus in their blood.
Antibodies are antibody-derived hormones (Ig) produced by B cells to fight viruses and other specific organisms and to identify a single virus molecule and then kill it.
Based on the above, the plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and then injected into 10 more severely ill patients.
Symptoms began to improve within 24 hours, with a decrease in inflammation and viral load and increased oxygenation in the blood.
However, clinical trials are needed to develop a wide range of therapies for patients before specific treatments are developed.
Furthermore, due to the effects of medications, some of the adverse effects associated with plasmids should be carefully considered.
For example, the immune system can over-react and then produce cytokines, which can be life-threatening toxins.
Normally, antibodies are low in the blood and high plasma levels are required to treat severe cases.
It is not easy to develop specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is important and critical to isolate B cells from healthy patients and then to either test for the genetic code of the active antibody or to test for active antibodies that are compatible with the essential proteins of the virus.
By doing so, we can actually increase the body's immune system.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness is based primarily on the combination of different drugs in a flexible manner due to the diagnosis of disease based on the TCM approach.
Many effective medicines are unknown or poorly understood because of the difficulty of identifying and controlling the drugs or their ingredients.
Currently, due to the lack of a specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the most important supportive therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or patients who have already recovered.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen drops have been shown to be potentially useful in treating COVID-19.
High recovery rates for COVID-19 patients have been observed in several provinces in China that have used TCM in 87% of local cases, such as Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 cases, the recovery rate was very low (13%).
However, this is an unbiased estimate because many other factors such as the number and severity of patients must be considered in the analysis.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing treatment using European and American medicines alone with combined WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for body temperature to return to normal, for symptoms to heal, and for hospitalization was significantly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group.
Most interestingly, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still require further research on a larger population and in more institutions.
It is also advisable to demonstrate the efficacy of these medications and to clearly describe the benefits of TCM medications used alone or in combination if possible.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients are often more likely to be at risk of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and those who are isolated are more likely to be unresponsive, lonely and irritable.
Also, symptoms of infection such as fever, shortness of breath, cough, and side effects of medications such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can lead to severe anxiety and mental health problems.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, a range of mental health conditions were identified including chronic depression, anxiety, fear, confusion, dementia, depression, and suicidal ideation.
Contact tracing and mandatory quarantine as part of COVID-19 prevention measures by public health departments can increase anxiety and guilt about the potential for infection, isolation and discrimination from family and friends.
Therefore, mental health services should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected contacts and others in need of care in general.
Mental health care should be accompanied by the establishment of multi-agency mental health teams, a clear and regular exchange of up-to-date information on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and patient care practices, and the use of social distancing tools and software.
Effective vaccines are essential to prevent infection between infected animals and infected humans and other animals or humans that may be infected with the virus and often complement antiviral drugs in the fight against new viral outbreaks.
There are already efforts to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce long-term antibodies or to increase immune response to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines using deactivated viruses have been tested in animals for SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in animals or in healthy and critically ill elderly individuals and in preventing infection with animal-derived viruses cannot be determined until clinical studies are conducted.
This may be because 17 years after the SARS outbreak, there are no new cases.
On the other hand, a small number of MERS cases remain in the Middle East and the virus is spreading to other regions due to the persistence of animal contagion in the affected areas.
Vaccinations against MERS have been developed using mutated viruses, DNA parasymides, viral vectors, extreme particles, viral-like particles and recombinant protein particles and some of these have been tested in animals.
Developing an effective and safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for people with weakened immune systems is a necessary and urgent step in the fight against the disease.
However, this is difficult to address because of the long time (about 18 months) required for a vaccine to be made by CoVs mutations.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has begun to show its potential for treatment in thousands of cases.
Patients can usually recover without serious complications.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also highly contagious and fatal in severe cases.
Therefore, the development of a treatment plan is essential to ensure that hospitals and clinics can effectively operate their services or in areas with inadequate facilities.
Based on clinical studies to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with treatment of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33):
Age: Age is a very important factor in assessing the prevalence of SARS, as is COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affected people aged 30 to 65 years, of whom 47.7% were over 50 years of age in the study of 8,866 patients as described above.
Patients who requested intensive care were more likely to have other medical conditions and complications and were significantly older than those who did not request it (average age 66 to 51 years), suggesting that age is a factor in the incidence of COVID-19 cases.
Gender: As defined, males are more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000) than females (0.27/100,000).
Multiple complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are often suffering from severe, traumatic heart problems that cause dizziness.
Cardiac failure has also been a leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive spleen cells, causing dark matter reactions in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth mentioning that age and disease are strongly correlated and can have a significant impact.
Extraordinary laboratory findings: Blood levels of CRP indicate the severity of tumor or joint lesions and have been shown to be a potential factor in the treatment of disease, drug tolerance and patient recovery.
A link between CRP levels and age and COVID-19 treatment has also been shown.
Furthermore, higher levels of LDH, AST, ALT, and CK can also be indicative of the outcome of treatment.
These tumors are most commonly found in various organs, especially the heart and spleen, and are released when organs are damaged.
This is why they are often associated with heart problems or obscurity.
Important symptoms: Chest X-rays and other transient symptoms should be considered along with other issues in planning treatment and COVID-19 complications.
Use of anti-inflammatory drugs: As mentioned above, anti-inflammatory drugs are anti-immune drugs that are widely used as adjuvants to treat infectious diseases to reduce the severity of immune system reactions.
Because the high corticosteroid dose of the patient has been used extensively in severe SARS patients, many patients have recovered from osteoporosis with permanent disability and poor health.
Therefore, patients with COVID-19 should take low-dose anti-inflammatory medications and short-term therapy if necessary.
Stress: As mentioned above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients experienced extreme stress due to prolonged isolation and severe depression and the loss of close relatives of those who had been ill.
It is important to provide these patients with psychological counseling and long-term support to help them recover from fatigue and return to a normal life.
Based on the patient studies to date, COVID-19 appears to have different symptoms than SARS.
In addition to infection of the chest airways, SARS-CoV-2 can easily travel through the respiratory tract of the throat and nose and cause mild or no symptoms in the early days of infection, as is the case with other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early days or during the time it takes for symptoms to appear may have higher levels of the virus in their normal functions, making the fight against the disease more difficult.
However, it has been shown that SARS-CoV transmission occurs in severe cases, as most infected individuals are immune in the early days.
This is why the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS pandemic.
There are currently a number of measures in place in China, including a curfew in Wuhan and surrounding cities and continued quarantine of virtually all residents to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the measures having severely affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a reversal of the epidemic.
A more interesting example is that the pandemic will end in March, and the recovery period will last between 3 and 4 months.
However, some experts are less optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues found that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a plan to end the pandemic and predicted that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in samples taken from the chest and throat of recovered patients 2 weeks after discharge from hospital, suggesting that the novel virus may be re-emerging as a normal flu.
However, there are some promising signs in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the measures taken may be effective.
Initial estimates put the number of cases at one million, with 500,000 deaths.
But due to strict quarantine measures, the disease was defeated.
As with SARS-CoV, it is possible that SARS-CoV-2 infects fewer people and then disappears or becomes a less lethal human-borne virus.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is shown in the following (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and can also be transmitted by contact with viral materials.
The virus has also been found in the urine, suggesting that there may be a new way of transmitting it through oral contact with the urine.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of patients may have been infected by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with pre-existing conditions and 40 physicians.
Therefore, greater vigilance is needed to protect individuals, especially doctors, social workers, relatives of patients, colleagues, and even pedestrians who may come into contact with sick or infected people.
The primary prevention measure that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of face masks; the use of medical masks and N95 (class #1860s) face masks helps to prevent the spread of the virus.
Medical masks help prevent droplets from an infected person from traveling through the air or onto objects and spreading to others.
However, only N95 masks (class #1860s) can protect against the ingestion of airborne viruses at 10 to 80 nm, which is 5% of the virus's range; SARS-CoV-2 is about the same size as SARS-CoV and both are about 85 nm.
Because particles can pass through even five consecutive medical masks, doctors who have frequent patient visits should wear N95 (class #1860s) masks instead of medical masks.
In addition to wearing masks, doctors should wear clothing designed to further reduce the risk of exposure to the virus.
Viruses can also be transmitted through the mouth.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; this means that the virus may have entered his body through his face.
Therefore, doctors should also wear protective eyewear or eyeglasses designed to be visible when treating patients.
For people in general who live in areas that are infected or at risk of infection, it is imperative that everyone wash their hands frequently with disinfected soap, try to isolate themselves and stay at home and avoid contact with people who may be infected.
The minimum distance between a patient and a patient is 1.5 meters.
These practices are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent further spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came to humans as a novel virus, its many similarities to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 must have caused China to become highly sensitive to the fact that it was still recalling the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, it was only on 19 January 2020 that the head of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public that the novel virus was not highly contagious and that human transmission was low and that controlling and eliminating the disease was not a problem.
This message significantly reduced public concern, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the chances of containing the outbreak in Wuhan were thus reduced.
The Chinese Centers for Disease Control can learn from this powerful lesson and make big changes in the future.
For example, these institutions should (1) be more careful in delivering public health alerts because the public is sensitive to every word and then changes their behaviour and decisions; (2) be more responsive to unusual information from hospitals and make informed decisions rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or authorities; (3) take more precautions to prevent any outbreak in its early stages rather than trying to calm the public; and (4) regularly organize specific training sessions to help the public become more aware of epidemics and to try and improve response strategies in different situations.
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries around the world at the time of this report.
Because the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to speculation that SARS is back.
However, there are clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for both prevention and treatment of the disease.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and affects men more than women, and the ageing and mortality rates are also higher among older people than younger people.
SARS is more lethal than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients are more likely to spread the virus in their acute stages, making it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This is one of the reasons why SARS-CoV-2 spreads so quickly and over a larger area than SARS-CoV.
The approved RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may not show infection in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, patients who recovered may have a recurrence of the virus.
All of this greatly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Despite this advanced stage in COVID-19 research, several key questions remain to be answered:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although there is a 96% similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs that originated in bats, we cannot confirm that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal first transmitted the virus from a virus-derived animal, such as bats, and then to humans?
Unless we know the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread of the virus, and the outbreak can return at any time.
Although molecular and tissue tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the respiratory tract and cause subsequent disease-causing mutations?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 cells in other organs?
Until we have clear answers to these questions, we cannot quickly and effectively diagnose and treat the virus.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does the virus mutate as it spreads from person to person?
Will it be a global pandemic, a SARS-like outbreak, or a flu-like comeback?
Finding answers to these and many other questions is important but can take time.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return people to normal.
Animals have transmitted coronavirus to humans.
Mutations and adaptations have allowed human and animal coronaviruses (CoVs) to evolve over thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human co-infecting CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East flu (MERS) have changed the picture of how serious and life-threatening HCoV infection can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 brought CoVs back into the media spotlight and caused a sensation due to their high transmission but low pathogenicity compared to their SARS-CoV counterpart.
HCoVs are a zoonotic disease and identifying the animal source of HCoVs would also be helpful.
Most HCoVs originated from bats and are not pathogenic.
Animals previously infected with some HCoVs are also unknown.
Knowing the animals around them has a direct impact on preventing human infections.
Research on animal interactions with CoVs may also be useful in understanding how CoVs cause disease in humans.
In this review, we provide a summary of current knowledge about seven HCoVs, focusing on their history of discovery and animal origin and how they spread between different species.
The main difference is that we compare different HCoVs focusing on the viral mutation and the genome replication.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is being studied in this section.
In addition, the requirements for viral transmission and the effects of viral mutations on disease severity are also described.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, a group of RNA viruses that are highly resistant and highly reactive.
These viruses contain large genome sizes of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses called CoVs because they are corona-like in the electron microscope.
In terms of structure, CoVs have unspliced genomes that are similar in structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large, parallel, unpaired proteins (ORF1a and ORF1b), which produce the differently functioning proteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The proteins with different functions are further refined to produce 16 non-uniform proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs of uniform proteins, including head (S), tail (E), nucleus (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Many of the associated homologous proteins are also produced by different CoV families.
Based on the differences in protein structure, CoVs are divided into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), with the beta-CoV type being the most common HCoV and being divided into four families (A, B, C and D).
Genetic evidence has shown that bats and bats are the ancestors of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the most closely related to gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over millennia, CoVs have been known to infect a variety of strains and some of these have been shown to be potent viruses that can cause human disease.
At present, only seven human-infected CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 which are classified as alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East flu coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic viruses, causing severe chest infection in many patients at high risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary outflow disorders.
The first strain derived from HCoV-229E, B814, was found in nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, there has been a growing body of knowledge from extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause life-saving symptoms.
Indeed, it was widely believed that infection caused by HCoVs was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the deadliest in recent history, with 8,000 deaths and an estimated 10% mortality rate.
A decade later, the Middle East flu epidemic (MERS) became a major epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula and occasionally spread to other parts of the world.
The novel HCoV 2019 (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which as of 2 March 2020 had killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000.
The warning period has passed and the world needs to prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs originated from bats, mice or domestic animals.
The evidence for HCoVs is diverse, with the most common co-infecting viruses being bats, which do not cause disease but have a different genetic makeup.
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused serious health, educational, social and behavioral problems in China and worldwide.
The search for animal HCoVs provides a way to understand the natural history, causes and barriers to the species leap.
This may also help or facilitate the identification of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen that first infected and caused its spread, which could have significant implications for preventing its spread in the future.
In this review, we provide a summary of animal origins of HCoVs, how they spread between species and how they cause disease.
In particular, we demonstrate and analyze the commonly held view that viruses that cause HCoVs do not normally cause disease in host animals but do cause disease in humans or new animals after spread to other species.
We also study HCoV mutations where high prevalence often results in a decreased susceptibility to disease.
In this context, we also assess the end of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
CoVs infecting animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first detection of a strain derived from HCoV-229E, B814, in nasal secretions of patients with the common cold, a variety of CoVs derived from various infected animals, including dendo, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs, were found.
Over the past decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the history of HCoVs discovery (Table 1) provides information and a general pattern of human response.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was identified in the respiratory tract of patients with nasopharyngeal disease in 1966, and later adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cells.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E exhibited symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneezing, nausea and sore throat, as well as fever and cough, which were observed in 10~20% of patients.
HCoV-OC43 was later identified in 1967 in a tissue sample and expressed in the brains of suckling mice.
The clinical symptoms of HCoV-OC43 disease are similar to those of HCoV-229E, and cannot be distinguished from infections caused by other respiratory viruses such as avian influenza viruses and common influenza viruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both found worldwide, and are most commonly found in the spring with peak seasonal temperatures.
The time it usually takes for both viruses to show symptoms is less than a week, followed by a course of illness lasting about 2 weeks.
As shown in the voluntary studies, non-infected individuals with HCoV-229E developed mild, mild influenza.
A small number of patients with immune deficiency developed severe chest chest infection.
SARS, also known as rare fever, was the first HCoV-related outbreak in human history to be extensively studied and was caused by SARS-CoV, the third HCoV identified.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS outbreak has resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths, spreading across multiple countries and continents.
Except for the highly contagious cases, it was shown that each patient could be as contagious as two other people, with the time to onset of symptoms being between 4 and 7 days and the virus reaching its maximum intensity on day 10 of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced joint pain, headache, fever, nausea and chills, followed by difficulty breathing, coughing and severe respiratory problems as later symptoms.
Decreased cell counts, poor dark matter scans and increased acute creatinine are the main problems identified by SARS in the laboratory.
Severe respiratory distress (DAD), epithelial cell proliferation and immune cell proliferation have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and ventilation.
In addition to the chest airways, various organs such as the spleen, spleen and kidneys can also be affected in these patients, often with elevated cytokines, which can be fatal especially in patients with autoimmune disorders.
The virus was first identified in a lung sample from a patient who had been to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, there have been many advances in HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was identified in a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first reported in infants, adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Nose fever, eye redness, eye burning and bronchiolitis are the most common causes of HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study identified the virus in a nasal swab taken from an 8-month-old male with asthma in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it is actually found worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 is thought to account for about 4.7% of common respiratory infections, and is most common in early summer, winter and spring.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with rhinitis causing nasal congestion.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was identified in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to respiratory and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to increase the severity of asthma-related illnesses in patients.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been detected globally, causing mild respiratory illness.
All four HCoVs are highly mutagenic and generally resistant to mutation to become highly contagious viruses, although there have been cases of unknown causes such as the rare strain of the highly pathogenic HCoV-NL63 strain, which was recently reported to cause severe chest infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs have the potential to spread widely and persist in humans, they have low susceptibility or infectivity.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with severe asthma and kidney disease in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-diagnosed cases are from the Middle East, occasional co-infections from other countries have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
A mild outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical symptoms of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by a severe case of pneumonia.
In addition to SARS, MERS patients have also developed severe renal impairment, thus making it the most common MERS variant in HCoV-related diseases.
Over 30% of patients develop symptoms of serious arthritis, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory tests have confirmed cases with a mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most lethal viruses known to date.
From mid-2019 to late December, cases of pneumonia known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the current outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of global concern and has designated the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases had been reported worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
In this context, the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, and outside the province is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe influenza like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is accompanied by fever, cough and difficulty breathing.
Some patients have diarrhea.
Asthma is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become unwell, leading to severe respiratory problems.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar in many aspects of their nucleotide structure at 82%, they have different branching structures on the stem.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more prevalent than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection without symptoms and may therefore contribute to the rapid global spread.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that should be considered.
First, the time it takes for symptoms to appear and the duration of HCoV infection are closely related.
In this context, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and that of four locally specific HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 disease exhibits symptoms that are common in the most commonly occurring HCoVs of the genus depending on the location, such as having non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
Also, a relatively low number of cases of COVID-19 can also be seen during the SARS-CoV outbreak, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also indicates a cautionary pattern of HCoVs that are species-specific due to their habitat with SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCoVs that are locally species-specific.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined whether the rate of spread of SARS-CoV-2 slows down after human exposure as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a serum test.
Future studies should determine whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through respiration and oral secretion is as significant as SARS-CoV at least in some regions.
It is also important to consider specifically whether SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed in different circumstances as in HCoVs that are species-specific.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its mode of transmission, susceptibility to infection and long-term transmission after human exposure will contribute to the end of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
HCoVs are classified by their location as all four have mild symptoms that have been able to adapt well to humans.
On the other hand, it is also possible that it is actually humans who have adapted to the four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived previous HCoV outbreaks.
HCoVs cause severe human disease and people with severe HCoV-related illnesses have died.
To survive, human coronavirus (HCoV) generate enough additional regions to allow them to mutate and damage the antibody protein that stops the virus from multiplying.
Therefore, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues to spread over time and infect more people, there is a higher risk that it will become more adaptive to the human body.
If it is well adapted, further human transmission will be difficult to contain by quarantine or other measures.
Over the years, four strains of the out-of-hospital CoVs have been circulating in humans, causing coughs in people who are already immunocompromised.
The viruses do not need to be in the animal.
On the other hand, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to human bodies, making human infection less likely to last.
They need to be continuously replicated in viral host animals in anticipation of reaching humans with weaker immune systems through one or more host and host-specific host species.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities in structure to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoVs that are not hospitalised.
It is highly contagious, similar to HCoVs that are transmitted outside of hospitals, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs that are transmitted outside the hospital and is less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it will adapt to humans and walk among humans without the animal.
Before discussing animal origins of HCoVs, it is useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of animal hosts, biota, habitats, growth and reproduction of HCoVs.
The animal is the source of HCoV growth when it is closely related to its parent with a high degree of genetic similarity.
The animal virus is usually familiar and does not cause disease in the animal.
The host animal thus remains a host of the HCoV virus and for a long time.
In both cases, the infected animals are chronically infected with the HCoV or its pathogen.
On the other hand, when HCoVs are new to the host animal just before or near the point of infection, they are not well-defined and often pathogenic.
The host animal is likely to be the most susceptible and highly susceptible animal to the virus, which can multiply rapidly and infect humans by increasing the rate of human infection.
HCoVs may be non-infectious if they do not mutate in their host animals.
On the other hand, HCoVs can adapt to their host and persist in it for long periods of time.
In this case, the animal that grows in it becomes a naturally bred animal.
Epidemic data suggested that the first case of SARS was transmitted during a hunting trip.
Subsequent blood tests showed that animal traders had higher levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The first time a cat and dog from a pet store were found to have SARS-CoV-like viruses, they were very similar to SARS-CoV.
This was confirmed indirectly by the fact that SARS continued to be reported after all lead in the market had been killed.
However, it has been reported that wild or feral animals have not been exposed to animals from animal markets tested positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the twins may also be animals in which SARS-CoV is widely distributed but cannot coexist naturally.
In particular, while 80% of the animal species in the Guangzhou markets have antibodies against SARS-CoV, it is undeniable that many species of small mammals can develop and multiply SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be resistant to SARS-CoV transmission.
Subsequent animal studies of immature SARS-CoVs revealed that the CoV was very similar to the bat CoV, named SARS Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), found in Chinese bats.
The bats have antibodies to SARS-CoV with the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% of the same SARS-CoV isoform.
The study confirmed a new theory that bats that carry immature viruses cause disease in humans.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none other than WIV1 is considered pathogenic.
The human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) is known to be a host for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 from mouse serum samples uses ACE2 from bats, mice and humans to enter the body.
Interestingly, the serum of SARS patients was able to deactivate WIV1.
To date, WIV1 has been shown to be primarily derived from bat SARS-CoV, with 95% similarity in only one isoform.
Although the two viruses are closely related, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the causative agent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the primary hosts of SARS-CoV.
The analysis of viral mutations places MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 in bats.
Both bat-HKU4 and MERS-CoV are receptors for the same DPP4 protein, which is used by the virus to enter the body.
The RNA polymerase protein structure of MERS-CoV is similar to its bat-infecting beta-CoV cousin found in Europe and Africa.
At present, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and another similar bat virus CoV-HKU25 are only 87% identical in the sample.
Thus, bats may not be the primary hosts of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels carry a specific immune system to MERS-CoV, as do camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV is similar to the human virus found in camel nose samples, further suggesting that camels are the true source of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that the most commonly reported mild but significant signs of viral maturation and proliferation were in camels tested for MERS-CoV.
In particular, infected camels released the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the urinary tract, which is the main route of transmission of the virus from bats.
However, there are concerns that many confirmed MERS cases have not been in contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which could be due to human or unknown transmission and possibly unknown animal strains carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% homologous cross-section with the bat-derived RaTG13 CoV.
In the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the genetic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too large to be considered to be of the same origin.
Bats may not be the primary host of SARS-CoV-2 unless a CoV-like organism is found in bats in the future.
It is likely that the animals that are the breeding grounds for SARS-CoV-2 are the wild animals that are sold and sold in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where most of the first COVID-19 cases originated, suggesting that animals may have infected humans.
Several recent studies based on the structure of the metagenome suggested that a small group of at-risk strains known as influenza may also be derived from SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The genome of the newly identified vaccine CoVs is 85-92% identical to that of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, they are closely related to RaTG13 and are approximately 90% identical at the isomer level.
They are in two subclasses that are similar to SARS-CoV-2 viruses in viral evolution, one of which has a cell-binding protein (RBD) that is 97.4% similar to SARS-CoV-2 in its amino acid structure.
In the most extreme cases, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although they are highly similar in terms of genome sequencing.
Previous studies of influenza infections also reported identifying viral isolates in lung samples, which are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used a variety of combinatorial and selective methods to assign one of the genomic sequences that make up 86.3% of the total viral genome.
It is also possible that the mosquito is one of the host animals for SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is of direct genotoxic origin because the genetic differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 are related to genotoxic beta-CoV.
Also, the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than the spacing between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 with respect to the beta-CoV that infects the virus.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, bats and other animals is yet to be determined.
While strong correlation patterns have been observed in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and the virus, SARS-CoV-2 and related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share strong genome-wide correlation patterns.
It is widely believed that the high degree of isolation between the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 virus and the beta-CoV infection with SARS-CoV-2 is due to selective mutation.
Another project seeks to switch the DNA between SARS-CoV-2 and the beta-CoV that binds to the virus and RaTG13 in the third generation of wildlife.
In terms of causation, mutation is common in beta-CoVs.
The team is still analyzing the SARS-CoV-2 virus in animal models.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoVs, animal derivatives of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
The mutation evidence suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the viruses that cause HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in bats.
It has been reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Mountain CoV) was identified in a North American tricolored bat that showed close affinity for HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while a camel strain was suspected of carrying the virus.
For clarity, the knowledge available on known animal carriers of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The analysis of viral mutations has provided evidence of historical inter-species transmission of HCoVs.
When HCoV-OC43 was isolated from some strains of human infection from domestic animals in the 1890s, an outbreak of respiratory illness was reported.
The history of inter-species transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
The alpha-CoV in bats similar to HCoV-229E has been identified.
Among them is alpha-CoV that infects the arupaga.
The evidence supports a direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, non-parasitic people encounter many insects in their communities.
However, humans are more likely to encounter arpaugas.
Second, HCoV-229E is related to the bat alpha-CoV and is not contagious and not contagious in bats, whereas the bat alpha-CoV was caused by respiratory infection in animals.
The alpha-CoV from the arupaga was then found in the wild.
Therefore, it is unlikely that HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs were transmitted to humans.
In short, bats are responsible for the transmission of the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus to humans.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats can easily transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
In contrast, where alpha-CoVs are a subset of the HCoV-229E gene, the arpaca and camel may have developed viruses that infect humans, which are similar to MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of interspecies transmission from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The mutation of MERS-CoV in bats was known when it was first identified and was confirmed by subsequent studies.
Bats are apparently the most important group of animal viruses in gene transfer and inter-animal transmission.
Longevity, cohesion, proximity and strong flight capabilities are factors that make bats powerful 'virus transmitters'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into camels for many years.
He was familiar with the camels that moved from being a breeding animal to a safe and natural host for the virus.
MERS-CoV causes mild disease and continues to mutate slowly in these animals.
Transmission to humans is risky and humans are not susceptible to MERS-CoV because of its low transmission rate.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of mosquitoes, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is variable.
In particular, the beta-CoV in mammals is highly pathogenic in mammals.
They may contain SARS-CoV-2 that is related to beta-CoV but not as contagious as SARS-CoV.
It is highly likely that animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, and animal transmission to humans, will be confirmed or not confirmed in future studies.
First, bats may be a strain of SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is becoming more and more similar to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share shelter with ants through mining and mining.
Second, mosquitoes may be among the most virally active and reproductive animals recently infected with SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans can transmit the virus through the slaughter and consumption of wildlife.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Studies in domestic and wild animals have shown that they have antibodies.
Third, the mutations and adaptations of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species of animals that were exposed to bats and camels.
The search for an animal that transmits SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the different species of animal that are hosts of the virus, three viral-side factors are also important in facilitating the transmission of CoVs to other species.
First, it is a very high rate of mutation in the synthesis of specific RNA fragments.
Compared to other single-RNA viruses, the CoV mutation is in the average or high range and the average rate of gene replication is ~10-4 per year per 2 genes, depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in the newly infected animal.
CoVs have RNA-modifying enzymes, which degrade their components to inhibit or even eliminate the mutation.
Remdesivir is also known to inhibit the activation of other CoVs by inhibiting RNA polymerase enzymes.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising medications against SARS-CoV-2 that has been clinically evaluated.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is about one million times higher than in the animals in which the viruses grow.
And the mutation is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the host animals.
In comparison to the highly mutated SARS-CoV, the low mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is evident, which makes it highly adaptable to humans.
It is said that he had already adapted to another animal that was very close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to camel life.
Therefore, it is unlikely that mutations would cause toys and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to become rapidly ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses alternative genetic engineering to modify and alter the genetic code; thus, increasing the chances of mutation in the host species, which is beneficial for the development of new CoVs when appropriate.
This is supported by the structure of the RNA that makes up the protein and its complex structure at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs mutate and often produce additional RNA fragments through genome-specific modification.
In the host, genome mutations occur most often when CoV RNA is transported to the cell membrane.
RNAs that are similar and have complementary genomes can alter the genome to produce new CoVs.
Genetic mutations of the virus have been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal-borne CoVs such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 in bats.
The relationship between viruses and animals in infectious diseases
In addition to the three viruses mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with its host animal is another factor that contributes to the transmission of infection between species.
Thus, the mutation of SARS-CoV is considered a valid model and has shown to be highly selective in the body region where the virus is involved in animal-to-animal transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between human SARS-COV and HCV, it is thought that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different host organisms, specifically the RBD mutation of the S protein.
In general, RBD from the S-protein of the CoV is associated with the host cell and is selected for its resistance to intrinsic antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at the 318th to 510th position in the S1 amino acid region, allowing it to bind to human ACE2 and serve as the entry point for the virus.
SARS-CoV RBD can detect ACE2 receptors from a variety of animal viruses, including bats, bats, mice, and rodents, which makes animals susceptible to the virus.
In general, only 6 amino acid residues have been isolated from human and viral embryos in RBD and 4 of these have a binding site to the viral ACE2 receptor.
The early SARS-CoVs have mutations in their RBDs K479N and S487T, which may enhance the interaction with S-protein and human ACE2.
In other words, conversion of these two amino acids may be important in the adaptation of the virus to the human body.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 is a receptor for the same gene as the SARS-CoV receptor.
At 30% of the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 region of the S protein indicates that the S protein is related to human ACE2 and may have been mutated.
In fact, cryo-EM studies show a 10 - 20 fold strong correlation between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S-protein.
It is also of interest to determine whether there is another receptor cell used to transmit SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but to a different S-protein subunit.
Other HCoV-receptor cells, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid with 9-O acetyl for HCoV-OC43.
It may explain how CoVs adapt to the human body from infected animals in which they were raised.
In addition to the host cells, the susceptibility of animals to HCoV is also regulated by the environment and the antibody.
The variation in the viral vector proteins between humans and animals has been shown to be a potential target for HCoVs such as cockroaches, camels and bats that may prevent cross-species transmission.
HCoVs alter their host genes and damage antibody proteins to allow them to infect other animals.
Therefore, the molecular components of these complex interactions between viruses and their host animals should be further characterized and described.
The genetic analysis of the viral growth site and antibody proteins for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced CRISPR technology may be productive.
The emergence of a new HCoV: its origin
The presence of multiple strains of CoV in bats provides a high probability of the emergence of a novel HCoV.
Thus, the CoV in bats is the source of the HCoV genes.
And rapid mutation and gene mutation allow HCoVs to mutate and are two key steps in this process.
For example: The discovery or loss of genes that make proteins have the potential to significantly alter the viral composition.
In the SARS-CoV model protein, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, while isolated SARS-CoV-related bat viruses appear to produce a different ORF8 protein.
The 29th isoform of SARS-CoV was identified in the gene at the beginning of the human outbreak.
This gene codes for ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be able to adapt to mutations that cause mutations in animals.
SARS-CoV is also known to mutate alpha and gamma-CoV strains, with a large number of mutated genes being localized in RNA polymerase proteins.
The mutations were also found in nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
In some cases, it is also possible that the MERS-CoV outbreak caused genetic mutations between two different strains of the virus in Saudi Arabian camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mutations have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs mutate CoVs of other animals in their own specific genes.
It should be noted that unnatural selection can contribute to unintended mutations in the viral genome, which can cause viruses to be released from the selected region, such as the host's antibodies.
An example of this is the absence of the normal ORF4 gene in HCoV-229E, which excludes the true binomial.
While strong ORF4 has been detected in bat and llama viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpha-CoV in arupaga shows intrusion by a single isomer, leading to mutations.
Finally, the mutation of new HCoVs is also influenced by the longevity of the host species.
The absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms have been observed when bats are infected with CoVs, suggesting a link between CoVs and ticks.
It is clear that bats are genetically well adapted to CoV.
For example: The inactivation of immune molecules in bats effectively reduces the risk of infection with CoV.
And the natural killer cells in bats have stopped working due to the addition of NKG2/CD94 receptor cells and the low expression of the type I T cell adhesion molecule.
Also, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from multiple immune responses can inhibit the CoV from binding to other organisms and affect the repair of the gene-modifying enzyme, thus selectively causing the virus genes to become more pathogenic when they enter new animals.
Other disease-causing CoV genes also mutate, producing a new protein or its components that makes the animal more susceptible to the virus.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have been identified in the last two decades.
CoVs do not cause disease or mild symptoms in large animals such as rodents and camels.
They change dramatically without significant resistance from the immune system they grow in.
This is where the mystery lies about why animals infected with the virus show no symptoms and why humans are more susceptible.
Severe symptoms are mainly caused by an over-reaction of the immune system and the release of more cytokines, the more the immune system attacks the disease, the more the lung is damaged.
This is in contrast to asymptomatic animals, where the antibodies to the mutant CoV evolve.
Isolation of antibodies may be useful in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Antiviral proteins are strong in bats.
Therefore, administering type I antibodies at least at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection would be beneficial.
The NLRP3 anti-viral protein is also inactive in bats.
Based on these hypotheses, inhibition of the NLRP3 protein with MCC950 activity would be useful in treating COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the evolution of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While bat beta-CoVs have been shown to share 95% identification with SARS-CoV, they also share 96% identification with SARS-CoV-2.
While mice and other market animals have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, no SARS-CoV-2 viruses have been identified.
A genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the genotype of the gen
Despite some concerns, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally produced by humans.
CoVs were re-introduced due to the recent emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 strain.
Research on HCoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of how HCoV-positive animals infect humans.
Strong evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are derived from bats and transmitted to humans through their host animals.
The fact that SARS-CoV infection is caused by close contact between humans and mice in animal markets, closure and killing of the mice in them would have effectively stopped the SARS outbreak.
Similarly, diapers should be removed from pet markets to prevent infection of other animals, based on research on the origin of the beta-CoV in diapers that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to mammals and other mammals remains to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has long been a camel virus.
Camels are important animals for transportation and supplying meat, milk, wool and fur for clothing to the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, not all camels can be sacrificed to combat MERS, as was done at the Chinese pet markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent a recurrence of MERS, stronger measures and other disease control measures are needed to develop a vaccine for MERS-CoV.
If we fail to destroy these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of CoVs infect animals that roam the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs have a wide range of potential.
In the future, it is very likely that CoVs infect animals and mutate, resulting in the emergence of new strains of CoVs that are more infectious or lethal.
The practice of eating wild animals in parts of China should be stopped while avoiding unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the light of the ongoing challenges posed by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a clear strategy for controlling these viruses is needed.
In short, there have been many viruses throughout history.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to escape.
Although bats have many of the characteristics that allow them to spread viruses, the risk of humans coming into contact with bats and other wildlife species can be reduced if people are trained to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the habitat of CoVs and their host animals, which is important for preventing animal transmission to humans and preventing future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent animal viruses is for people to understand the potential of the virus and the animals that live in it.
There are still many animal species from which SARS-CoV-2 originates that are not known.
First, if bats infect bats with the virus that causes SARS-CoV-2, it is interesting to see why bats and bats coexist in the same habitat.
Second, if bats transmit the virus directly to humans, human exposure to bats should be documented.
Third, if the tertiary mammals function as true mammals, how they interact with other species such as humans, bats and reptiles remains to be understood.
Finally, if most mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and monitoring of their transmission should be performed.
Whether it is a bat, a mosquito or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its pathogenic strains are expected to appear in the host species in the near future.
Further studies in these animals will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will play a significant role in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A review of the guidelines for testing COVID-19 suspected and confirmed cases is necessary.
On 6 February 2020, our team published Rapid Guidelines containing recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (2019-nCoV), and the guidelines provided us with experience and provide a better understanding of the global response to the pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a novel disease, and our understanding and knowledge of it is gradually improving based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided new guidelines for the diagnosis of suspected cases and confirmed cases in accordance with the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In response to the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed emergency guidelines and published them on the website of the Military Medical Research Council on 06 February 2020.
Since its release, it has attracted a great deal of attention.
However, it is important to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge are gradually improving based on ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually being updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, published seven volumes with some significant changes in chapters.
Our policy then adopted the idea of Zhou et al, who developed a simplified scoring system based on their medical experience.
Their work added new concrete evidence to our policy and provided useful insights into the global pandemic.
We support their hard work and commend them.
However, their findings should also be updated in light of the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (Phase VII Trials) and the latest research.
As stated in the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of suspected cases must be linked to one of the following epidemiological characteristics and two epidemiological parameters for a complete diagnosis, or to three epidemiological parameters if the epidemiological history is unclear:
Epidemic history: (1) Travel to, or residence in, Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other locations with COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) Contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (including test positive for nucleic acid); (3) Contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other locations with COVID-19 cases in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) Contact with local populations (more than 2 people with fever or respiratory symptoms in a 2-week period, such as at home, school, office, etc.).
Symptoms: (1) fever or shortness of breath; (2) symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, stable or decreased levels in the initial stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case showing either of the following clinical or genetic signs: (1) a real-time PCR test that showed SARS-CoV-2 infection; (2) a sequence of viral subtypes that suggest a similarity to a newly identified coronavirus; (3) a positive IgM and IgG specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 IgG specificity from a healthy to a healthy patient, or an increase in a single site greater than 4 times the recovery phase during a critical phase.
It is noted that the respiratory nucleic acid levels or blood samples were taken when the second volume (18 January 2020) and third volume (22 January 2020) were added.
Diagnosis in blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions of the literature; then the blood-based indicators were added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on ongoing research to identify the best way to detect the presence of nucleic acid for rapid testing, and also to identify samples from the respiratory tract including blood samples, which allows for a variety of samples, and support the inclusion of specific strains of the infected in the standard criteria.
In addition, there are numerous warning signs to be aware of in rare cases with and without symptoms.
For this reason, the chart of Zhou et al. needs to be revised, as they categorized a person with no symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system should also be monitored in other clinical and research activities.
Finally, we hope that more indirect evidence will emerge and we invite readers to comment.
As for testing "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend that they follow and comply with the new guidelines of their respective countries.
Our team will also update our guidelines in a timely manner to provide support.
Bangladesh reported five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest number in a single day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a total of 114 confirmed cases and 33 recovered cases at home.
The death toll stands at 17.
In a news release, IEDCR Director, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that four men and one woman were among the dead.
According to Dr Meerjady, two of the deceased were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also announced that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, the country's leading daily, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the head of Bangladesh's Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Sunday, in a video message posted online, Bangladesh's Transport Minister Obaidul Quader said public transportation was suspended for a longer period than originally planned, until Saturday.
The travel ban was scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of basic goods including medicines, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on 8 March, in two people who had returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By 9 March, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than a million people worldwide.
On Thursday, the total number of confirmed cases of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 people have died from COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus.
The figure was announced on the same day that Malawi reported its first case of coronavirus and Zambia its first death from coronavirus.
On Thursday, North Korea declared itself one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infection.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-eight hours before 10 a.m. Central European time (08:00 GMT) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported, including 5,900 deaths.
Citing data from Johns Hopkins University, CBS News reported that 1,000 people died from the coronavirus in the United States on Wednesday.
Globally, countries have announced strict measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the curfew until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to receive their paychecks until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament extended the state of emergency for 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to an all-day period; previously, curfew was from 15:00 to 06:00.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 22:00 and 04:00.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that his state extended the curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia have set a limit on the amount of toilet paper a person can buy.
On Saturday night, Woolworths and Coles stores in Australia reduced the amount of toilet paper to two and a minimum of one pack of toilet paper in all stores nationwide.
On Monday, ALDI also announced a one-pack limit.
The figures were posted as a message at the checkout and on the Facebook pages of the stores.
It was reported that consumers were buying the toilet paper in bulk due to COVID-19 fears when quarantine was required.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also reduced the amount of toilet paper going into household products to one pack per order.
The subsequent changes would have restricted the use of one four-pack toilet paper package that was introduced by Woolworths and Coles stores on March 4 and 5.
In a March press release, Coles's stated that under the current four-pack policy, many stores are running out of products within an hour of their closing, and called the purchase "unprecedented", while ALDI said on Facebook on Tuesday that it was "unexpected".
Sales "surged" in the past week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco in Canberra also reduced the number to two packs of toilet paper last week.
To further reduce the shortage of toilet paper, Coles ordered larger packages from its customers and increased the frequency of shopping, and Woolworths ordered more toilet paper, while ALDI brought in stock for the Wednesday show that went on sale earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, said retailers could increase their inventories, but the local council's rules for trucks made it difficult.
He believes that commodity prices will rise, as lenders try to meet customer demand and offer them less promotion.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to early stock runs, some stores would not be able to offer Wednesday's promotion.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer, a business expert at Queensland University of Technology, said stores are stocking at night.
He also declared that toilet paper is a commodity in the package, which makes it scarce in stores, and when it is sold out, it leaves a lot of space on the shelves without any availability, which makes people feel more deprived.
Russell Zimmerman of ABC News: "Coles and Woolworths believe that having more products on the shelves like toilet paper and pesticides in abundance would reduce public anxiety".
Who Gives a Crap, a used toilet paper company, said it ran out of products in its warehouse on Wednesday.
News.com.au reports that the company's manufacturer of Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, insisted they would be open 24/7 to satisfy the market.
Domain.com, a real estate website, announced that realtors would also be providing free toilet paper to first-time buyers at the Melbourne Tower, which has a limited number of towers because customers had a holiday that coincided with the weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily paper newspaper in Darwin, added eight pages that can be cut and used as a clean sheet.
Stores were reluctant to impose regulations, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report, which said they had no plans to impose regulations on purchases.
Other top sellers included masks, insecticides, dry foods, hand soaps, and detergents, Zimmerman said.
It was the same outside Australia, where on Sunday night the UK e-commerce store Ocado reduced Andres' toilet paper to no more than two 12-packets.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current COVID-19 outbreak caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic.
While the term "epidemic" refers mainly to the extent to which the disease has spread across countries, not specifically to its severity, WHO stressed the importance of governments' involvement in the fight against it:
"All countries can change the course of the epidemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, said: "Countries will identify, test, treat, quarantine, welcome contacts and encourage prevention".
"We are deeply concerned about the rapid and rapid spread of the epidemic and the lack of action to combat it.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the epidemic is "unprecedented".
In a statement released by CNN in February, he said: Besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has evolved beyond its initial appearance into a global pandemic.
Ghebreyesus also shared his views, saying: We have never seen a coronavirus outbreak.
He adds: and we have never seen an epidemic that can be effectively controlled.
The evolution of the pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of global concern.
The Director General of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci, said: "The obvious is that the pandemic is making things worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 new cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is the current outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
In December 2019, an outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China; on 30 January 2020, it was declared a public health emergency of global concern, and on 11 March 2020, it was declared a pandemic.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million people had been infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, of whom approximately 97,000 had died.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is 4% in China, while the global average is between 13.04% in Algeria and 0.8% in New Zealand.
Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Severe symptoms include pneumonia and severe respiratory problems.
The onset of symptoms is usually within five days of exposure, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or cure for the virus.
Primary care is to treat symptoms and help the patient to recover.Preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining social distancing, monitoring and quarantining suspected cases.
Global leaders have addressed the pandemic with travel bans, quarantines, quarantines, workplace epidemic controls, and institutional closures.
The pandemic has disrupted economic and social activities, postponing or cancelling sporting, religious, political and cultural events and has also caused a global shortage of goods caused by the fear of pandemic.
Schools and universities have been closed either nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting nearly 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Rumours about the virus also spread online, with reports of violence or discrimination against foreigners, especially Chinese, people of East and Southeast Asian descent, and others from areas affected by the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closure of major industries, air pollution and air pollutants have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the Ministry of Health in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported cases of pneumonia of unknown origin, and a trial began in early January 2020.
The cases are linked to a Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where the virus is suspected to have animal origin.
The virus that caused the pandemic is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus similar to the coronavirus in bats, bats and SARS-CoV. The first known case of symptomatic disease was identified on 1 December 2019, and the case was not related to the animal market.
Other cases were first reported in December 2019, with two-thirds of them having a link to the source.
On 3 March 2020, unconfirmed reports in the South China Morning Post reported that the case, which was first reported on 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, was likely the first.On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that new cases had decreased in China but were increasing in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be many unreported cases; especially those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, the lowest number of cases were reported among young people, with those under 19 accounting for 2.4% of the global total.The UK government's scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that 60% of the UK population was at risk of infection before a vaccine was available.
The case count is the total number of people tested positive for COVID-19, and these tests have been validated in accordance with state protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland have imposed restrictions on testing for mild symptoms.
A study released on 16 March found that as of 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 cases in China were undiagnosed, with unreported cases accounting for 79% of reported cases.
Analysis of statistics released on 30 March showed that the number of cases in Italy was higher than reported.
The rate of new infections (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the number could be as high as 5.7.
Most cases of COVID-19 are curable.
For non-returned patients, the time from onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, but is most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, nearly 97,000 people have died from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The official death toll from the COVID-19 outbreak was mostly from people who tested positive for COVID according to government protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be higher than reported, as it does not include untested deaths, e.g., deaths at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Some reports from Italy suggest that the overall death toll during the pandemic is 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said: "We are aware that the reported death toll is not consistent with the actual death toll, and this is consistent with the reports that the United States is not responding to all deaths from the virus. Such rescue of all deaths usually occurs during pandemics such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak.The first confirmed case was on 9 January 2020.
On 1 February, the first death outside China was in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen people in Iran, South Korea and Italy had died.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.Many measures are in use at different locations to count the death toll.
These figures vary by region and time period, and are influenced by the number of cases collected, the functioning of health systems, the timing of the outbreak, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and general health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University data, the overall mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039/1 617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The figures vary by region.
In China, the overall mortality rate has decreased from 17.3% (in case of symptomatic cases on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in case of symptomatic cases after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the CFR, which measures the proportion of patients who have died from the disease, and the IFR, which measures the proportion of patients (whether or not tested) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are not based on a random sample and follow specific individuals from infection to recovery or death.
Many universities have tried to calculate such numbers for certain populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Symptomatic Medicine estimates that the overall prevalence rate is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher figures in this category are consistent with the results of the first COVID-19 screening of vaccinated individuals in Germany and the study's data showing the mortality rate based on the test.
The WHO says the epidemic is preventable.
The timing of the mass transmission and the duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary from region to region.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said: Without control, disease outbreaks often come and go and slow down when the contagion is gone.
But it is difficult to predict at the moment what the end of the world will be.
Zhong Nanshan, the chief medical adviser to the Chinese government, said that "the epidemic may be over by June" if all countries comply with WHO guidelines to stop the spread of the disease.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 would move from one area to another, possibly for a year or two.
According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures should be followed "until a vaccine is available (in 18 months or longer)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, because of its highly contagious nature, will go away completely and it may evolve into a seasonal disease, with annual recurrences.
The re-emergence of this highly contagious virus will be determined by the immune response and mutations of the virus.
COVID-19 symptoms may be non-specific and infected individuals may not show symptoms.
The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, nausea, loss of smell, difficulty breathing, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, colds, vomiting, bloody cough, diarrhea or bluish skin. WHO estimates that about one in six people will develop respiratory problems and become infected with the virus.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists symptoms that include respiratory problems, pain or itching in the chest, occasional dizziness, difficulty waking, swelling of the face or lips, and those with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms do not resolve. Progressive disease can lead to diarrhea, severe respiratory problems, bleeding, metabolic complications, and death.
When some infected individuals may not show symptoms, where they do not show symptoms but test results indicate that they are infected, researchers recommend that those who have had contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and tested for infection.
China reports a symptom-free rate ranging from a few cases to 44%.
The typical onset of symptoms (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) is between one and 14 days; usually a few days.A more dubious example is the fall in the number of COVID-19 cases with previously no olfactory function from 30% to 15%.
Some of the transmission data are not yet clear.
It is thought that the disease is mainly transmitted through close contact with the droplets that result from coughing, sneezing or close contact with another person within 1 to 2 meters.
Studies have shown that coughing without a cover can cause falls of 15 to 28 feet (4.5 to 8.2 m).
Others suggest that the virus may be transmitted by long-term airborne droplets that may be released during speech. Respiratory droplets may also be released during breathing, primarily through airborne transmission.
These droplets can fall into the mouth or nose of people who are in close proximity or inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as CPR and CPR can allow the airborne fluid to be released into the air and the disease to be spread through the air.
It can also be spread by contact with an infected area such as the skin and then touching the face, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted by exposure, the risks are thought to be low.
The Chinese government has denied that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through the infected person's feces and through the infected person's mouth.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after symptoms appear, although it is possible to spread before symptoms appear and during the most severe phase of the disease.
People who are diagnosed within three days of the onset of symptoms are more likely to be infected before they develop symptoms.
There have been few reports of asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been reported in some countries during surveillance testing.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) states that it is not clear how easily a disease can spread, with one infected person infecting two to three others.
In particular, the virus can survive for up to three days on plastic (porphyrene) and 304 days on stainless steel, one day on carton and up to four days on copper.
However, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend that people wash their hands after touching animals and after working in areas where people may have been exposed.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, isolated from three cases of pneumonia associated with the Wuhan flu pandemic.
All the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of the coronavirus.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by a household soap that dissolves the acne and covers it.The SARS-CoV-2 virus is very similar to its SARS-CoV cousin.
It is thought to have evolved from animals.
Genetic analysis indicated that the coronavirus is in the same group as the Betacoronavirus, which is in the Saribekovirus family (family B) and both originated from bats.
It is 96% identical to the genome of other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found only one amino acid difference in the genome structure between the virus from mosquitoes and the virus from humans.
To date, comparisons of all genomes have shown that up to 92% of the genome of the mosquito coronavirus is associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to confirm that mosquitoes were the first infected.
Viral infection can be tentatively diagnosed based on symptoms, while it must be confirmed by rRT-PCR laboratory test of infected tissue or CT scan.
A comparative PCR-CT study conducted in Wuhan showed that CT is more accurate at detecting viral patterns than PCR, although some of the characteristics of this laboratory technique are not well defined and are associated with other diagnostic procedures for pneumonia and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Immunology states: CT scans should not be used for diagnosis or as a primary method of COVID-19 diagnosis.
The WHO published a number of protocols for testing RNA for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was released on 17 January.
The test uses a laboratory-based rRT-PCR technique that is used in real time.
The test may be performed on samples taken from the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are usually available within hours or days.
The test is usually performed with a nasal swab, although a nasal swab may also be used.Many laboratories and companies are developing antibody-specific blood tests.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these methods have been shown to provide accurate measurements for widespread use.
In the United States, the Cellex blood test is approved as a medical procedure but is only used by approved laboratories.
CT scans are a method used to test people who show symptoms including GGO or fluid in the lungs.
The Italian Association of Imaging Medicine is developing an international database of results of diagnostic imaging of confirmed cases.
Due to the similarity to other diseases such as adenoviruses, iron samples not validated by PCR cannot specifically detect COVID-19 infection.
A large study in China compared chest CT and PCR results and found that while these CT scans were not specific, they were fast and accurate in their detection of viral patterns, which could be considered a diagnostic tool for epidemiology.
CNN's artificial intelligence-based method was developed to detect viral image patterns using a CT scan.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease generally include proper hygiene, hand washing, avoiding unwashed hands on the face, nose or mouth, and coughing or sneezing with a towel and discarding the towel immediately.
Those who have been infected are advised to wear a face mask when in public.
Social distancing measures are important to prevent the spread of the disease.Many governments have banned or advised people to avoid non-essential travel to or from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, in many parts of the world the virus has reached the point where it is transmitted from person to person.
This means that the virus is spreading through the community, and some members of the community are unaware of where and how they were infected. Healthcare providers who are treating a person who may have been infected are advised to follow basic precautions, contact-avoidance guidelines, and face coverings. Follow-up contacts are an important way for healthcare providers to identify the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The government's use of mobile phone location data has raised privacy concerns with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for an end to this surveillance.
Various applications were developed or proposed for voluntary use, and then on 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were looking for a privacy-friendly solution such as using Bluetooth technology to store data from mobile phones that have been connected.
Users of these phones receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some misinformation is being circulated about ways to prevent infection; for example, sniffing and applying mouthwashes do not kill the virus.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but several companies are developing one.
Hand washing is essential to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds; specifically, after using the toilet or with obviously contaminated hands, before eating, after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because when the virus is not in the human body, it is killed by household soap, which has the ability to break down the virus's membrane.
The CDC also recommends using a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Viral agents are present in a wide range of environments that can be killed with specific agents (within one minute of exposure to a stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stainless steel stain
Other drugs, such as benzarkonium chloride and corohexidine gurukonate, are less effective at killing bacteria.
The CDC recommends that any suspected or confirmed cases of COVID in a facility such as an office or daycare, any public place such as a desk, bathroom, public place, shared electronic devices such as tablets, laptops, notebook computers, telephones and ATMs used by patients, be disinfected.
Health facilities require people to cover their mouth and nose with a sleeve or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and to dispose of the handkerchief immediately.
Medical masks are the best choice for people who may be infected, as wearing a mask reduces the amount and amount of fluid released during speech, sneezing and coughing.
The WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a face mask reduces the frequency of facial contact, which is the most common infection when hands are not cleaned properly. Masks are also used by caregivers of a potentially ill person.
The WHO recommends that people who are not sick wear masks only if they are at high risk of infection, such as caring for someone with COVID-19, and acknowledges that wearing masks prevents people from touching their face.
Many countries have begun to encourage their citizens to wear masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing masks made from non-medical cloth.In particular, China recommends that healthy people use disposable medical masks, especially when in close contact with others within 1 meter.
Hong Kong requires people to wear medical masks when traveling or in public places.
Thai health authorities would encourage people to make fabric masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going outdoors without wearing a mask or covering their noses and mouths.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a face covering in public places for safety and to protect others.
The Australian government has mandated that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face coverings when in public.
On April 1, Taiwan, which produces more than ten million masks per day, required passengers on commuter trains and buses to wear masks.
Panama has mandated the wearing of face masks whenever you go outdoors, and requires homemade masks for those who cannot afford to buy homemade ones.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Contact avoidance (also known as personal distancing) includes activities aimed at preventing transmission in order to reduce the spread of the virus and to maintain social distancing.
The measures include quarantine, travel bans and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shops.
Individuals can use social distancing measures by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding public places, using non-confrontational greetings and maintaining social distancing.
Currently, many countries are mandating or asking people in affected areas to avoid contact.
The maximum number of gatherings required by US government agencies and health centers was quickly reduced from 250 (when there was no known COVID-19 infection in the area) to 50, and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned gatherings of more than two people.Older adults and people with other medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and immune system disorders who are at risk of developing illness and health problems were advised by the CDC to stay at home if they are at risk of contagion from peers.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began replacing the use of the term "contact avoidance" with "personal distancing", to describe that the avoidance of contact is a safe practice when there is a clear social distancing.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the perception that people should be isolated, rather than encouraged to remain in contact with others through other means.Some agencies have issued guidelines for healthy sexual behavior during the pandemic.
These guidelines include that you should only have sex with your partner who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation is required for people who have tested positive for COVID-19 or are suspected of being infected.
Health authorities have issued clear guidelines on best practices for self-quarantine.Many countries have mandated or required that all people living in areas with high infection self-quarantine.
Strict quarantine instructions were issued for those in high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with high infection have been advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the last day they may have been exposed.
Epidemic control measures are to contain or stop the spread of the disease and slow its spread.
Prevention is carried out at the beginning of the outbreak and aims to monitor and isolate cases and to introduce additional infection control measures and vaccines to prevent further spread of the disease to other communities.
When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of an epidemic, then the focus is on mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on healthcare and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
However, stopping the epidemic requires strong measures to contain the epidemic by reducing the number of new cases to less than 1. One component of pandemic response is to try to reduce the excessive rate of infection known as the reduction of new infection rates.
It reduces the burden of overcrowding in health services and provides more time to seek out vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical infection control measures include controlling the epidemic through personal precautions such as strict sanitation, wearing masks, and self-isolation; community-based measures such as school closures and public lockdowns; public awareness and response; and environmental measures such as mass sweeping.More drastic measures were taken to control the outbreak in China as the severity of the epidemic began to be felt, including the closure of all cities and strict travel restrictions.
Other countries have also adopted various measures to contain the spread of the virus.
South Korea has begun mass testing and quarantining of certain areas and announced travel restrictions.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who self-isolate and imposed heavy fines on those who do not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and punished those who misuse medical devices, while the UK and US have shown that both reducing infections (reducing the number of infections would not stop the spread of the epidemic) and containment (reducing the number of new infections) have been significant challenges.
Measures to reduce infection rates can reduce the dramatic increase in need of healthcare services by two thirds and the number of deaths by half, but do not prevent thousands of deaths and healthcare services from continuing to receive high numbers of patients.
Stopping the outbreak is the best option but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in humans (or until a vaccine is available, depending on what has happened before), the infectious agent, or the virus will reappear if these measures are relaxed.
Long-term efforts to contain the epidemic have social and economic consequences.
No specific antibodies have been approved to reduce the severity of COVID-19, but development is ongoing, including testing of conventional antibodies.
Taking over-the-counter flu medications, drinking plenty of water, and getting enough rest can help reduce symptoms.
Due to the flu, oxygen therapy, hydration and respiratory support are necessary.
Steroid use can cause you to become ill.
Several drugs that have been approved for other viral infections are being studied for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO has stated that: traditional andhome remedies can reduce the severity ofSARS-CoV-19 symptoms.
Capacity building and performance adjustment to address the needs of healthcare systems to treat COVID-19 patients are defined by the WHO as key measures in the fight against the pandemic.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe issued guidance to hospitals and primary care providers on changing the focus of laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-essential medical procedures, isolating and quarantining COVID-19 patients, and increasing the capacity of intensive care units to train doctors and increase the number of ventilators in patients and beds.
There are different accounts of the origin of the first infection (first case of the virus).
The first known case of a novel coronavirus was on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei has been steadily increasing.
The infections were mainly linked to a Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market that also sells live animals, and other reports suggest the virus was derived from some of these animals; in other words, it originated from animals.The pneumonia cases were diagnosed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian of Hubei Provincial Hospital, Wuhan Jianghan CDC reported on December 27.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital reported to colleagues the emergence of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were questioned by the police for spreading rumors, while another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for not reporting the matter.
The Wuhan City Health Commission issued a public statement on 31 December informing the WHO.
Health authorities were alerted to a large number of cases of unknown pneumonia in Wuhan, prompting a screening programme in early January. At the beginning of the outbreak, cases nearly doubled every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, helped by new travel to China and the fact that Wuhan is a hub and a major transportation hub for rail transportation between provinces.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
The latest official data showed 6,174 people with symptoms on 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy in the number of confirmed cases worldwide.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 recoveries.
Almost 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, Schengen countries have reduced travel and implemented border controls.
Countries have implemented measures to control the pandemic such as quarantine (also known as stay-at-home orders) at their local level.As of 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or nearly 90% of the population, were in a similar situation in the US, with over 50 million in the Philippines, nearly 59 million people in South Africa and 1.3 billion people in India under quarantine.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were on a similar stay-at-home order, which increased to 2.6 billion two days later, almost a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was first reported on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; unconfirmed reports suggest the first case was reported on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian followed up with patients with unknown pneumonia on December 26, the Wuhan Jianghan CDC reported on December 27 from his hospital.
A baseline genetic analysis of patients on 27 December 2019 showed that SARS was similar to coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan City Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO received the same information on the same day.

This also resulted in a 33-43% decrease in the number of people entering commercial areas in March compared to February.
Retailers in major global markets have increased measures, such as increased sanitation, temperature meters for customer temperature and cancellation of holiday events.According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic will leave between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty, more than would otherwise have been the case.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the 300 million rural Chinese workers are confined to their homes in the interior provinces or Hubei province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans have lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus pandemic could result in 47 million job losses in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%.In India, the Stay-At-Home Program has left millions of Indian immigrants (who are not yet in the country) without jobs.A study by Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced unemployment.Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the Stay-At-Home Program began in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a general credit scheme.About half a million businesses in Germany sent their workers to temporary state-funded schemes known as Kurzarbeit'.
The German temporary compensation system was also adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and cultural heritage sectors have been hit hard by the pandemic, as it has affected the functioning of institutions and individuals (both employer and private) globally.
Cultural and artistic organizations have sought to fulfill their (often publicly funded) responsibilities to preserve cultural heritage, ensure the safety of workers and the public, and support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and in various forms, museums, libraries, galleries, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed and their exhibitions, events, and performances were cancelled or postponed.
To address the issue, measures have been taken to implement additional digital services. Another recent major decision that is accelerating the decline of the pandemic is the suspension of all social events, major sporting events and other public events including concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced that the celebration of Holy Week in Rome, which falls on the last week of the Christian penitential season of Lent, was cancelled.
Many dioceses have asked older Christians to stay at home rather than attend church on Sundays; some congregations have broadcast the meetings on radio, Internet, or television while others have arranged for the meetings to be followed from their cars.
While the Catholic Church closed dioceses and chapels and the main site of St. Peter's Basilica to pilgrims, other churches banned services and reduced the number of people who gathered in churches, mosques, synagogues, and similar places.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and later closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and banned local residents from the holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since the end of World War II.
Several tournaments have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 English Premier League, the 2020 European Championship, the 2019-20 US Hockey Championship and the 2019-20 NHL.
The pandemic also disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to start in late July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the Games would be "postponed to a later date in 2020 but no later than summer 2021".
This has led to a large shift in online gambling, with many gambling sites reporting a sharp increase in subscriber numbers.Entertainment has also been affected, with many bands cancelling or postponing their concert tours.
Large concert halls, such as Broadway, canceled all entertainment.
Some artists have sought to maintain their productivity and share their work online as an alternative to traditional in-person presentations, online concerts, or web-based "events" with artists to promote and promote their work.
The internet has seen a surge in viral images focused on the coronavirus as many people have sought to be entertained and entertained while still being unsure of where things are headed.
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been widespread prejudice, xenophobia, and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian descent, as well as people from high-risk areas in Europe, the United States, and other countries.
Deep fear, prejudice, and conflict have been reported in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and even the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still in China) revealed a racial bias among groups around the world, saying that the Chinese deserved the virus or would receive the punishment they deserved.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against based on their ethnicity.
There was support for Chinese people, both physically and online, as well as those in the affected areas.
As the epidemic continues to spread to new countries, the population of Italy, the country with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Europe, may experience a crisis of homophobia and xenophobia.People in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed a warning letter urging other countries not to allow Chinese people into their countries in an effort to stop the spread of the epidemic.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was widely used on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asian people in Britain and the United States reported increasing incidents of racial violence and attacks.
US President Donald Trump has also been heavily criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "China Virus", a term that critics see as discriminatory and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and study in major cities in India have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal branch Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese have destroyed the environment "so God punished them".
This was immediately condemned by the Chinese Embassy in Kolkata, calling it "inappropriate".In China, xenophobia and racism were suppressed by the epidemic, with foreigners being considered "foreign trash" and should be discarded.
Many newspapers with a fee-for-view website have removed some or all of the fees for coronavirus-related news stories.
Scientific authors have published scientific papers on the epidemic and are available to anyone who wants to.
Some scientists have chosen to share their recent research findings on software servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 includes viral detection and antibody detection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is unique and is designed to detect only RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent infections or illness.
Identifying antibodies (blood tests) can be used both for diagnosis and monitoring of populations.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have the disease, including those with symptoms too mild to report to authorities if they are infected or asymptomatic.
The exact number of deaths from the epidemic and the level of public immunity can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to the low number of confirmed cases, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population as of March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a wide variation in how testing was carried out across countries.
These changes can also have a significant impact on mortality rates, possibly being greatly exaggerated in some countries.
Using rapid transcriptional reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the diagnosis of the disease can be made from samples taken from the respiratory tract available using a variety of methods, including a nasal swab or a nasal swab.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing with nasal swabs is the only reliable method available during the first week of the disease.
The virus can then be eliminated in the throat while continuing to spread in the lungs.
For people who tested positive in the second week, it is recommended that they have additional tests such as a fever test.
One of the most recent PCR tests was tested at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using rRT-PCR and 250,000 kits provided by the World Health Organization.
The UK had also scheduled a test by 23 January 2020.On 28 January 2020, South Korean company Kogenebiotech launched a trial of a PCR-based medical device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It detects the "E" gene for the human coronavirus strain, as well as the RdRp gene for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive approval from the National Institute of Medical Devices to use PCR-based SARS CoV-2 test kits.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is deploying RT-PCR Diagnostic kits for the new Coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) in public laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One of three DNA tests in the previous version of the test kit resulted in uncertain results due to substandard medications used, as well as testing challenges at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of 100 tests per day being successfully tested throughout February 2020.
The two-part test was not expected to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and only then were state and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use.Commercial laboratories in the United States began testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Quest Diagnostics also made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020.
No specific numbers have been announced; collection and processing of collected samples must be done in accordance with the requirements of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Institute for Virological and Biotechnology Research VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the National Institutes of Health began testing the virus.On 12 March 2020, it was announced that the Mayo Clinic had developed a device that could test for COVID-19.On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to develop a virus test that would give results in a maximum of 3.5 hours, allowing one machine to test 4,128 people in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to conduct a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received emergency use authorization from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test that uses thermal imaging technology on nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a sequence of heat exchanges, this method can provide results for the infected in as little as five minutes and for the clean in as little as 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States and Abbot plans to increase capacity to 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses antibodies that bind to the N-cell coronavirus is under development in Taiwan and is expected to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to the speed of a flu test.
In March 2020, research papers concluded that "initially, chest X-rays are not very useful in diagnosis, and the results of computed tomography (CT) may be present before the onset of symptoms".
The features of the CT scan include the ability to view the entire lung, with a clear view of the lateral, medial and posterior portion.
Pulmonary embolism, a severe narrowing of the lining of the lungs, increases with the progression of the disease.
A study comparing PCR and CT scans in Wuhan to trace the origin of the outbreak found that the evidence suggested that the outbreak was more severe in Wuhan, where it was mixed with other more severe respiratory diseases.
As of March 2020, the US National Academy of Immunology has recommended that "the Wuhan method should no longer be used for the diagnosis of coronavirusCOVID-19".As of March 2020, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that PCR be used as the primary diagnostic test.
One of the immune system's main mechanisms is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
This can be useful for detecting infection in humans as early as day 7 or after initial symptoms, for measuring immunity levels and for conducting community monitoring. Sampling can be performed in a standard laboratory (CLT) or a point-of-contact (PoCT) test site.
The same screening methods used for mass testing in many medical laboratories will be used for analysis, but the availability of results will depend on the speed of the process.
In conventional laboratories, a single sample of collected blood is usually used, although successive samples may be used to monitor immunity.
In another test site, one of the most common samples of blood was a perforated skin.
Unlike PCR, pre-test extraction is not required before testing.On 26 March 2020, the FDA announced that 29 companies had notified it as required and could now provide the results of the antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA for use in emergency situations.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostic received European patents for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The detection capacity of infection can reach hundreds of samples in a matter of hours and is now much faster than the PCR test that was traditionally used to detect viral RNA.
Antibodies usually appear within 14 days of the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that no antibody level monitors were available and none could be used adequately.
Hong Kong has introduced a home-based system whereby any suspected infected person can stay at home, receive a "specific kit" from the emergency department, be screened and returned for a response at a later date.The UK National Health Service (NHS) announced plans to implement home testing for suspected infections, which will reduce the risk of infection when a patient arrives in hospital, or require the injection of antibiotics into the car that brought the patient.In the process of taking a COVID-19 test, the doctor will do so in a professional manner that follows all guidelines.
The test facility in their vehicles has enabled South Korea to produce some of the fastest, most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the Medical Health Insurance Association announced on 2 March that it has the capacity to test nearly 12,000 tests per day using an emergency medical technician and that around 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance if the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the CEO of Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, testing systems have been implemented in many major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only cases were reported.
A preliminary laboratory study reported that at least 483,295 people had been tested in the week of 12/2020 including the 12/2020 quarter, of whom 33,491 (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a system to test 64 patients at once, where samples are taken and retested later if any were found to be infected.In Wuhan, a 2,000 m2 emergency laboratory called "Huo-Yan 火眼" in Chinese, or "Eye of Fire" in Mandarin, was officially opened on 5 February 2020 by the BGI, which can test more than 10,000 people per day.
Construction was supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasted for 5 days, with samples showing that infections in Hubei would have increased by 47% and the cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled if the current testing capacity was not available.
The Wuhan laboratory was soon followed by Huo-Yanmu laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, an average of 50,000 tests are performed per day. A fast and easy-to-use method developed by Origami Assays can test 1,122 COVID19 patients with just 93 samples. This modular method can be performed in small laboratories without the need for a robot to process the fluid.
As of March, shortages and shortages of laboratory-grade vaccines were a major barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This has led some authors to write about the preparation of tests that require heating to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to detect the test-response cells.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was the first country in the world to test a large proportion of its population, with the country testing almost all of its population.
This was due to the combination of testing capabilities in their vehicles, and the purchase of multiple-test labs in Group 42 and BGI (based on Huo-Yan Rapid Testing Laboratories).
Built in 14 days, the lab can perform more than 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first of its kind outside of China.
Different testing methods for different components of the coronavirus pathogenesis have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has approved a German-provided production facility for export to poor countries that cannot afford to do so themselves.
On 17 January 2020, Germany announced its own system, a system developed by the US Centers for Disease Control that was not available until 28 January, causing delays in testing in the United States.China and the United States had concerns about the lack of confidence in the quality of existing test kits, and these countries, like Australia, were unable to satisfy the market and follow the advice of medical experts.
However, experts say that South Korea's extensive testing program has helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, especially in private laboratories, has been built up over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called on countries to increase the number of tests and programmes as the most effective way to slow the spread of COVID-19.The increased demand for testing kits due to the spread of the virus has led to many being overlooked by U.S. laboratories, creating a critical challenge in providing the necessary equipment and medicines to treat the pandemic.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing equipment.
In the United States, a device developed by the National Center for Disease Control was defective, and the government removed the barriers to independent testing.Spain purchased a device from Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, a Chinese company, but found it to be defective.
The agency explained that inaccurate results can be caused by poor sample collection or improper use of equipment.
The Spanish Ministry of Health announced that it would remove the products that produced the defective results from the market and replace them with products made by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the products that the Czech Republic purchased from China had defective results.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million products from China that were found to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič wanted it to be dumped into the Danube River.Ates Kara, the Turkish Minister of Health, said the test kits purchased from China were of poor quality and should not be used.The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but recently in April 2020 declared them unusable.
Testing, followed by quarantine and tracing of contacts for SARS-CoV-2, was effective.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, where the first COVID-19 case in Italy occurred, doubled the population of 3,400 over a 10-day period.
Almost half of the confirmed cases were asymptomatic, and all those who showed up were quarantined.
Restrictions on travel to other regions have effectively halted new infections.
Due to strict surveillance of contacts, restrictions on movement, testing and quarantine, the coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was relatively low compared to other developed countries and was accompanied by no permanent closures of restaurants and businesses.
Most activities were suspended, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time for the holiday on 23 March.
Many countries that have also responded to the outbreak have implemented contact tracing, domestic travel restrictions, testing, quarantine, and home confinement but not as strict, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have shown that countries that have tested more people, relative to the number of deaths, have lower death rates, perhaps because those countries have the ability to identify those with mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have the testing capacity and do not have adequate and capable laboratories to test for COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten positive COVID-19 samples to 16 WHO model laboratories to validate the tests.
Of the 16 sample laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Infected as a percentage of test cases" section may change depending on national testing policies.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher ratio of cases per test, if not more, than a country that tests the entire population, with or without symptoms.
Hand washing, also known as hand sanitization, is the practice of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing at "critical times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases such as diarrhea, cholera, and oral-to-oral transmission.
People can contract respiratory illnesses such as the common cold or flu, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their face, nose or mouth (i.e., the genitals).
The five most important times of day when handwashing with soap is necessary include: before and after bathing, after feeding or changing a baby's diaper, before feeding, before eating and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, wash hands with soap ash.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing:
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a baby's diaper or after cleaning the baby after using the toilet.
After coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
After handling, feeding, or cleaning animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical care.
Hand washing before administering medication or before handling a patient can prevent or significantly reduce the spread of infection.
The primary purpose of medical hand washing is to clean hands that have been exposed to infection (bacteria, viruses, or other pathogens) and chemicals that may cause reactions or illness.
This is especially important for those who prepare food or work in the medical field, but it is also a good practice for everyone.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing other causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory diseases;
and reduce the mortality rate of home births.
A 2013 study found that proper hand washing can contribute to healthy development in children under five.
In developing countries, child deaths from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced with simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple approach can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Encouraging people to wash their hands can reduce about one-third of diarrheal cases and this is equivalent to providing clean water in low-income communities.
A 48% reduction in diarrhea-related illness can be attributed to soap-based hand washing.Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory illness (ARI), and should be a routine at home, school, and in the wider community.
Tuberculosis, a serious respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming the lives of some 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both claim the lives of some 3.5 million children each year.
According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), regular soap use before and after eating and using the toilet can save more lives than any other vaccine or treatment, and reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and respiratory disease deaths by a quarter.
Hand washing is often included in other hygiene activities that are part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) systems.
Hand washing also prevents skin staining from spreading through contact with others.
A minor drawback of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to excessive dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, stiff skin, commonly called finger skin disease, which is more common among healthcare workers.
Heavy hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five key times of day where handwashing with soap is necessary to reduce the spread of infections through the urinary tract: after using the toilet (toilet, toilet), after feeding (change of diaper), before feeding, before eating and before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other areas where handwashing should be used to prevent infection include before and after treating a wound or ulcer; after coughing, coughing, or sneezing; after handling animal waste or handling animals; and after handling litter.
In many countries, there is a low standard of handwashing with soap.
A 2015 handwashing survey of 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households used soap to wash their hands.A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had a high rate of 97%; the United States had almost 77%; and China had a low rate of 23%.There is now a shift in attitudes to encourage people to wash their hands with soap in critical situations.Simplified handwashing for school children at scheduled times of day is one of the ways that can be used in developing countries to teach children to wash their hands.
The Primary Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is a good example of activities aimed at improving children's health and education.
Taking anti-venom twice a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride, is the cornerstone of the national program.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The disinfection of the skin is enhanced by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main benefit of soaps and detergents is to reduce waste and increase efficiency.
Water alone does not cleanse the skin properly because oils and fats, which are similar to those in soil, are not easily soluble in water.
Cleanliness involves the use of adequate water.
Non-water soaps, because they can be reused, can retain bacteria that have been passed on from previous users.
A small number of studies have examined the transmission of pathogenic bacteria from contaminated soap and concluded that infection is impossible because the pathogenic bacteria are wiped out by the fungus.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) still recommends that "water soap and a non-touchable soap dispenser are the best option".
The use of disinfectant soaps has been highly praised by health-conscious people.
There is currently no evidence that the use of antibiotics or antibiotics is an alternative to antibiotic resistant bacteria known to be resistant to antibiotics.
However, disinfectant soaps contain insecticides such as triclosan, which has a large list of resistant bacteria.
So even if antibiotics are not selected from the soap that kills infectious bacteria, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to protecting the surface and skin, the products may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as hydrolyzed wheat, benzoic acid, and other protective agents (carrot, protein, menthol, and other herbal products).A detailed study by the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that regular soaps have the same immunity and hand-washing ability as soaps designed to kill germs.
Hot water that can be used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill germs.
pathogens grow rapidly at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils from soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using hot water does not reduce the amount of germs on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, hand washing with disinfectants (commonly known as sulfur hand sanitizers) became popular and popular.
Most are made from isopropyl or ethanol alcohols that are made by mixing carbomer in a liquid or a sweetener such as glycerin into a spray or oven to facilitate use and reduce the effects of alcohol on the body.
Adding free hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity.Hand sanitizers containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol can be effective at killing germs.
Hand sanitizers containing mercury kill bacteria, bacteria resistant to many drugs (MRSA and REV), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) as well as the herpes virus.
Hand sanitizers have a 70% kill rate of 99.97% (3.5 decrease, equivalent to a 35 decibel reduction) of hand germs within 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 decrease) of hand germs within 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are highly effective against germs but have a low anti-viral activity.
Hand sanitizers appear to have little effect against norovirus (Norwalk) which is a common cause of gastrointestinal infections.Hand sanitizers should be used in a moist or spreading manner on both hands.
The front and back of the hands and the middle and ends of each finger are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the water, broth, or detergent dries.
Washing the fingertips thoroughly with both hands is important.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with disinfectants, especially if hands are obviously contaminated.
The continued use of this method is based on its ease of use and rapid disinfection; however, this method should not replace the standard hand washing method unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of hand sanitizers containing mercury can cause dry skin unless the product is added to soften or reduce irritation.
This dry skin from acne can be reduced or eliminated with gliselin or other skin conditioners.
In clinical research, hand sanitizers that contain a soothing, but also a softening agent are more resistant to damage than soaps or antibiotics.
Skin irritation, rashes, or swelling due to the presence of a hand sanitizer are rare.
The low risk of skin damage makes this method more popular than handwashing with soap and water.
While effective, waterless hand sanitizers do not clean hands of all dirt, but only of the germs that infect them.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than soap and water at preventing the spread of many viruses, as the virus remains on the hands.
The effectiveness of chlorine-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on their ingredients, and in the past they were not as effective as chlorine and other chlorine-based products.
Recently, benzalkonium chloride products have shown sustained antimicrobial activity after administration, unlike arsenic, which has been shown to decrease in efficacy after repeated administration, possibly due to its effects on the skin.
Many people in low-income countries cannot afford soap and therefore use ashes or dirt.
Using ashes or dirt is a more effective alternative to water, but it is also less safe than using soap.
One concern is that ashes or soil contain microorganisms that can be contagious and thus increase the spread of the disease more than they slow it down.
Like soap, ashes kill bacteria by forming acids when they come into contact with water.
If soap is not available, the World Health Organization recommends using ashes or sand.
The proper handwashing practices recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the spread of the disease are as follows:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
Running water should be used as the water in the tank can be contaminated and the temperature of the water does not change significantly.
Wash your hands with a clean cloth, rinse thoroughly with plenty of soap, and rinse the back of your hand, between your fingers, and under your nails.
Soap removes pathogens from the skin, and studies have shown that people wash their hands better with soap than with water alone.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing your hands tightly creates a pressure, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and rubbing them tightly removes most of the bacteria.
Wash your hands thoroughly with running water.
Soaking hands in a basin can re-contaminate hands.
Dry your hands with a clean towel or air dry.
Wet or well-dried hands can become re-infected easily.The most commonly missed areas are the fingertips, thumb, interphalangeal area, and even under the fingernails.
The larvae of the crab or the colorful crab can be a host for germs.
Water softeners are recommended to prevent the spread of hand infections; very dry skin can be damaged and this increases the risk of infection.
Other simple methods can be used to facilitate handwashing when the use of a faucet or soap is not available, such as pouring water with a wooden hose (sandwich) or a special-purpose hose or using ash if necessary in developing countries.Where water is scarce (such as in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving measures such as a hand wash and other low-cost methods.
Kandagirarebe is a simple technology that uses a jar attached to a rope, pouring water with a foot, and washing hands with soap and water.
Proper hand drying is an important part of hand hygiene, but there is currently debate about the best way to dry hands in a public toilet.
Numerous studies have shown that paper towels are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London, with funding from The European Tissue Symposium, conducted a study to compare the hygiene levels of wipes, towels, and modern hand sanitizers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air hand dryer, the total amount of pathogens was found to increase by an average of 194% on the hands and the palms by an average of 254%.
Drying hands with a ventilator increased the total amount of pathogens on the hands by an average of 42% and on the palms of the hands by an average of 15%.
After hand washing and drying with a special paper, the total number of germs was reduced by an average of 76% on the hand wipes and 77% on the hands.Scientists also conducted studies to determine the potential for infection between bathroom users and the environment due to each type of drying process.
The desiccant, which also exhaled at a speed of 180m/s (650km/h; 400mph), was able to remove germs from hands and other areas and was capable of infecting other bathroom users and keeping germs at a distance of up to 2 meters.
Using a hot-air hand dryer will keep germs within 0.25 meters of the device.
Paper towels have been shown to have a lower germ spread.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined a variety of hand sanitizers.
The following changes were observed in the number of germs after hand drying:
There are many manufacturers of hand sanitizers, and hand sanitizers have been compared to toilet paper.
Hand washing with a hand sanitizer is another option when traveling without soap and water.
Hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its value (in 1846) in preventing disease in hospitals.
Some devices remind healthcare workers to wash their hands if they forget to.
Some studies have shown that their use reduced the rate of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, with plenty of soap and water or a special anti-fungal agent, and both hands are washed together.
The hands should be folded together in a way that they are closely spaced.
If there is dirt under the nail, a special cloth can remove it.
Since pathogens are trapped in water on the hands, it is important to rinse and dry hands thoroughly with a clean cloth.
After hand drying, a paper towel should be used to seal the water (and even open the exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being re-infected by the area they were touched.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to remove germs that can cause disease and prevent the spread of disease.
Hand washing remains a challenge in clinical settings, with a growing number of doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before handling patients, which contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, reports The New England Journal of Medicine.
One study found that hand washing and other simple practices can reduce the risk of blood-borne diseases by 66%.[citation needed] The World Health Organization published a guide to hand washing and hand sanitizer safety in healthcare settings.
A draft of the institute's hand hygiene guidelines can be found on its website for public comment.
The major revision was made by Whitby and others.
Commercial equipment can measure and verify hand hygiene, if required to demonstrate the requirements of the regulations.
The World Health Organization recommends "five times" for hand washing:
after contact with blood/drops
before the treatment, and
after treatment.Adding disinfectants to soap ("medicinal" or "bacterial" soaps) helps to kill infectious germs by washing hands.
Such disinfection may be required before surgery or in areas with high levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.To wash hands properly before surgery, it is important to have a hand sanitizer that can be closed and opened without using hands, chlorhexidine or iodine, a sanitary hand towel to dry hands after washing, and a sanitary hand towel and other sanitary hand sanitizer.
You must remove all jewelry.
This procedure involves hand and elbow washing, usually between 2 and 6 minutes.
Washing hands for longer periods of time (approximately 10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing your hands, avoid re-dropping the water.
After washing your hands, wipe them with a clean cloth and wear a dressing gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash or use hand sanitizer before and after handling a patient.
In a study of staph clinics, the majority of the benefits of handwashing were found to be obtained from the first 20% of hand washing, with a small increase in the benefits when handwashing frequency was increased to over 35%.
Washing with regular soap is three times more effective in preventing foodborne illness than washing with soap designed to kill bacteria.Comparing the use of hand sanitizer with soap designed to kill bacteria in 30 seconds, both found that using hand sanitizer reduced infection by 26% compared to soap designed to kill bacteria.
However, washing with soap and water is better than using hand sanitizers to reduce the transmission of A/H1N1 influenza virus and other viruses that remain on the hands.Handy hygiene initiatives in clinics may include handwashing training, increased hand sanitizers, and written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of these assistive devices in health care in many different settings.
In developing countries, handwashing and soap are considered important and inexpensive ways to achieve good health, including a healthy diet.
However, the lack of regular access to water, soap or handwashing equipment in private homes, schools and workplaces is a major barrier to achieving universal handwashing practices.
For example, in many rural areas of Africa, handwashing faucets near public or private toilets are still scarce, despite cheaper alternatives to building handwashing facilities.
However, the low rate of hand washing may be due to a persistent habit of not washing, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging handwashing with soap can be a policy-reformer, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term societal change.
To do this effectively, monitoring and analysis are essential.
A review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing practices in LMICs, while social media advertising is ineffective.One example is the promotion of handwashing practices in schools as a "three-star approach" by UNICEF to encourage schools to use a simple, cost-effective approach to ensure that students wash their hands with soap and other sanitary products.
When the basic criteria are met, schools can go from one star to three stars.
Building public handwashing facilities may be one of the main ways to promote handwashing practices to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
International Handwashing Day is another example of a campaign to encourage people to wash their hands to achieve behavioural change goals. Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF developed a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have shown the overall effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries compared to the DALYs.
However, one study found that promoting handwashing with soap was more effective than other water-based methods.
The importance of hand washing in human health, especially for vulnerable people such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospital, was recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Ignaz Semmelweis, a Hungarian physician who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, an English "innovator in nursing".
At that time, many people still thought that infectious diseases caused by bad breath were called germs.
In the 1980s, foodborne and medical-related infections led the US CDC to intensify efforts to raise awareness of hand hygiene as a key way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu pandemic and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led countries to better understand the importance of handwashing with soap to prevent the spread of these infectious diseases.
For example, large signs with the words "best practices for hand washing" are hung next to hand washing racks in public toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "washing hands" on something implies a person's unwillingness to admit to the act or to tolerate the complicity in the act.
It originates from the Biblical Book of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but the phrase remains in common use among English speakers.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins washing her hands to remove a stain she suspects of having, which reveals a guilty conscience about her actions and the actions of her husband.
It has been found that people, after remembering or thinking about doing something inappropriate, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and place more importance on handwashing equipment.
And those who are allowed to wash their hands after thinking about these bad practices are less likely to repeat other "cleansing" acts of repentance such as voluntary acts.
Some religions require their adherents to wash their hands as a part of hygiene and religious rituals. Hand washing is a religious ritual, using only water without soap and washing hands, and is part of the ritual of many different religions, including Baha'i, Hindu, Teva, and abanetrat diamond in Judaism, Rabbis in Christianity, and Wudu in Islam.
Hindus, Jews, and Muslims all require hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims all require that they wash their hands before and after eating.
Measures to combat the COVID-19 epidemic in the workplace
COVID-19 workplace prevention measures are essential to ensure the safety and health of the workplace in the context of the 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19).
Effective workplace epidemic control measures are determined by the location and workplace of the individuals, based on an analysis of the risk of infection, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk of individual workers with vulnerability to COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), a low-risk workplace is one where employees are in close contact with others and where basic precautions are in place to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home when sick, guidelines for preventing respiratory illness and regular hygiene and disinfection of the workplace.
A work with a moderate risk of infection is one that requires frequent contact or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been contagious through contagion or international travel.
This includes employees who work in the public sector such as school workers, those who work in crowded areas and those who work in high-volume stores.
The prevention of infection for these workers is in addition to basic prevention measures, including adequate ventilation with ventilators, respiratory protection equipment and the provision of protective clothing for those in contact with someone infected with COVID-19.
OSHA recommends that healthcare and recreational workers who are exposed to or suspected of having COVID-19 are at increased risk of infection, which increases the risk when such workers perform ventilation, collection or analysis of samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
The best way to control the spread of the disease for these workers is to use specialized equipment such as air-tight rooms and protective clothing that is appropriate for their workplace.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have a significant impact on the workplace.
Employees may miss work due to illness, need to care for others, or fear of infection.
The nature of the business may change, both in terms of how goods are ordered and how they are purchased (such as buying goods at discounted hours or billing or delivery services).
Then, shipments from areas affected by the COVID-19 outbreak may be cut off. Preparatory measures for the response to the infectious disease may be used as a preventive measure.
The plans identify risks in many workplaces and the workplace itself, including potential sources of infection, risks from the home and community, and risks to workers themselves due to old age or chronic illness.
They also provide guidance on how to manage these risks and other measures that can be taken if the pandemic fails.
Communicable disease preparedness and control programs may be implemented at the national or regional level.
Measures to control the spread of disease in specific populations include reducing contagion between workers, protecting people at high risk of other diseases, keeping businesses open, and mitigating the impact on other businesses in the manufacturing and handling industries.
The poor health of the communities where the business is located may affect the measures taken.
A series of epidemiological control measures are widely used to control the spread of the disease and to protect the safety and health of the workplace based on their effectiveness.
Where it is not possible to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, the most effective way to control the outbreak is to use specialized equipment, followed by management measures and specialized protective clothing.
Anti-infection with dedicated equipment is to protect workers from work-related hazards independent of worker behaviour and can be cost effective to implement.
Management measures are changes in work rules or procedures that require implementation by an employee or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than the previous two methods, but it can help prevent infection.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the risks to the worker, appropriate to the work (e.g., respirators), worn regularly and properly, checked regularly, handled and replaced as necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of for disinfection.
According to the US OSHA, a low-risk occupation is one that has high exposure to the general public or to co-workers.
Basic prevention measures should be followed at all workplaces and include frequent hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory prevention guidelines including covering when coughing or sneezing, distribution of sanitary pads and disposal, electronic communication, preventing shift workers from entering or leaving at the same time if necessary, restricting the use of colleagues' equipment and cleaning and disinfecting workplaces.
Early identification and quarantine of potential contacts is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The CDC recommends that employees with severe respiratory illness stay home until fever, fever, and other symptoms subside for at least 24 hours without taking antipyretic or other medications to treat symptoms, and that they relax the procedures for requesting sick leave, allow employees to stay home with a sick family member, and notify employees of such procedures.
According to OSHA, a job with a moderate risk of infection is one that requires frequent contact or close contact within 1.8 m with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 through contagion between people in the workplace or because people have recently traveled to a COVID-19-infected area.
These include workers who are exposed to the public at large, such as school workers, those who work in crowded areas and those who work in high-risk retail locations. Management measures to control infection among these and other high-risk groups of workers include encouraging employees to stay home, changing the number of emergency rooms and changing the number of ventilators, and setting up plastic restraint signs such as a mask and a window for customers who are not in their cars. Management measures to prevent infection among these and other high-risk groups of workers include encouraging employees to stay home, changing the number of emergency rooms and changing the number of people who are in contact with the public, and preventing workers from returning to work, including putting on personal protective equipment, protective clothing and protective equipment, providing workers with the necessary tools and equipment to prevent or prevent the spread of COVID-19, providing them with the necessary information, protective clothing, and other tools to prevent or prevent the spread of the virus, and providing workers with the necessary tools and equipment to protect themselves from the risks of COVID-19.
Workers in this risk group are rarely required to use respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, appropriate measures should be taken to protect staff and other passengers, including isolating the patient from others and maintaining a 2-meter distance between them, assigning a flight attendant to provide medical care, providing a mask or requiring the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with a cloth when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew should wear disposable medical gloves when assisting a patient on board or handling bodily fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and wear protective clothing when necessary if a patient on board has fever, cough or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other items considered to be used after use should be stored in a special bag and contaminated areas should be wiped and disinfected after use.On passenger ships, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, viral control includes postponing travel if someone is ill and self-quarantining and immediately reporting to the ship's medical centre if anyone on board has a fever or other symptoms.
It is preferable to have medical supervision when the person is isolated.For schools and nurseries, the CDC recommends temporary confinement for hygiene or disinfection when an infected person is exposed to a school building regardless of contagion.
Even with a low or high number of interpersonal contagion, contact prevention measures can be implemented by avoiding school and public gatherings such as physical activity or choir lessons or eating in the canteen, increasing the distance between seats, keeping people in and out of the room, avoiding unnecessary visits, and using a separate clinic for children with flu-like symptoms.
In the event of a local outbreak, in addition to close contact prevention measures, long-term school closures may be considered.For security personnel with regular daily work, the risk of immediate outbreaks is low according to the CDC.
Safety personnel who have come into contact with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case are required to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including wearing protective clothing.
In the event of close contact during an arrest, personnel should wipe and disinfect their belts and equipment before reusing them with household wipes or wipes and follow standard instructions for storing and disposing of used protective clothing and for storing and washing used clothing.
OSHA recommends that certain health and recreation workers be at or above the highest risk of infection.
Occupations with a high risk of infection include healthcare workers, laboratory workers, and transportation workers who may have been in contact with a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
These are at increased risk of infection if the occupants perform activities that include ventilating patients, collecting or testing samples from a known or suspected COVID-19 patient.
Respiratory therapy includes ventilation, coughing, ventilation, some dental procedures and examinations or internal examinations.
The greatest risk of infection in recreation is associated with workers who prepare the bodies of known or suspected COVID-19 cases at the time of death; they are at higher risk when performing a morphine test. And infection control with specialized equipment includes risk groups including quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including oxygenation operations.
A special ventilator may be appropriate for some healthcare professionals and recreational workers.
The samples should be taken in accordance with clinical safety guidelines level 3.
The WHO recommends that patients who are admitted to hospital should be kept in isolation in wait rooms due to suspected COVID-19.Whether it is personal protective clothing, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for those working within 2 feet of known or suspected patients with SARS-CoV-2 and those who are working on oxygenation.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved respirators of N95 or higher must be used in accordance with a formal, written safety policy for respirators, including appropriate wear testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of helmets can provide better protection for wearers and make the worker more comfortable.The WHO does not recommend that workers wear helmets because COVID-19 is a respiratory illness rather than a fluid-borne disease.
The WHO recommends that only medical masks be worn by staff who visit a hospital.
For respiratory samplers, caregivers, or transportation of COVID-19 patients without ventilation, WHO recommends the wearing of a medical mask, light bulbs or a mask, a jacket, and gloves.
When a patient is being resuscitated, a medical mask is replaced by N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Given the global scarcity of personal protective equipment (PPE), WHO recommends reducing the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical use, implementing emergency measures such as public windows, and limiting access to a COVID-19 patient's room to healthcare providers, using PPE only when necessary for specific tasks, maintaining the same respirator without removing it when caring for multiple patients, monitoring and coordinating the production and handling of PPE, and restricting the use of a single mask for asymptomatic patients.

PURPOSE: [Covid-19] Reducing burden and preparing for the future
The time/date of the update is 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC.

We are in an extraordinary situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear indication that the world has become a village and that we need to help each other.
We have not faced these challenges, but we know that the best way to deal with the pandemic is to listen to the issues around the world, work together and remain united within this community.
The warmth and attention we have seen from all our colleagues through email, phone calls and chat is a testament to the extraordinary personality we have been fortunate enough to work with.
I cannot thank you enough or express how proud I am of you all as my fellow workers.
Last week, someone expressed his appreciation for our work.
He reminded me of the worldwide use of Wikipedia today, which is a strong sign that it is a site of valuable information that should stay online and accessible to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether it's keeping the site running or paying our colleagues or keeping our workplace safe.
The world needs Wikipedia information now more than ever.
Now is the time not only to look at what we do but how we do it, and we will make a meaningful difference in the world.
Given the importance of this role and your role in it, we are going to make important changes to the way we work, starting next week.
Adapting to our schedule
As Robyn said, our team met last night to discuss our strategy and our schedule for the next few days and months.
In this article, we discussed what we thought would be the best solution to our situation and the best way to keep the family alive in this time.
We especially wanted to remove obstacles and sustain our assignments for a long time.
If you want to call, that's fine.
For the ministers, who have the promise and who serve according to all the covenants:
The expected working hours are 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
It is not a vacation; if you can work regular hours, we can use it to help you in your assignment.
In today's fast-moving world, though, whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for food, or go shopping - your health is your priority.
We don't monitor your work.
If you are sick, do not go to work.
It was not mentioned but quoted.
You do not have to request sick leave or paid leave, you should inform your supervisor and help your team review the calendar and schedule so that the core work continues.
(If you test positive for COVID-19, contact Bryan at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide support and appropriate administrative attention to your situation.)
Full hourly rates will be paid.
We have reviewed and reaffirmed our commitment to meeting our obligations to our contractual partners and to our hourly partners.
Each person will be paid according to the number of hours worked in normal circumstances.
Sometimes you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to escape the stresses of the world.
What we do can be of great value especially in these times.
Again, the goal is to take care of yourself.
Our goal is to have you speak to your supervisor, to learn what to expect and to adjust the process accordingly.
Some work is considered important.
There are things we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety teams are set up to raise funds (and other resources) for critical work that requires additional support.
We will begin to review all departments to review existing objectives and adjust our focus to support the core functions.
There are important things we all need to do, but there are important projects we need to focus on.
Doing a little now will have no effect.
We do not plan to work almost twice as hard to make up for lost time once the pandemic is over.
You are not expected to work overtime to keep up with your deadline, which is not possible at this time.
We recognize that things have changed and we will work to set new goals and agendas wherever they are appropriate.
What will happen to the annual plan?
To adapt to the fact that things are becoming more like daily working hours, we want to change the timetable of the 2020-2021 program.
Our goal is to request an extension of the 2019-2020 planning period to allow time for budgeting by encouraging employees to prioritize core work, care for themselves and their loved ones while supporting those who want or want to work fewer hours in the coming weeks.
This increase in schedule significantly reduces the workload and pressure on the entire family.
We will be reviewing our proposal with the Board next week and will update the other representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as possible after approval.
The strategic planning team was pleased with the leadership skills it demonstrated.
Office conditions, contagion and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that a colleague of mine working in SF came into contact with someone who may have contracted COVID-19.
However, out of caution, we have hired a virus hygiene team to administer disinfectant throughout the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral system and sterilized the entire area, including the entrances and the bank sensors on the floor of our office.
The building is implementing anti-virus instructions with user safety features.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared if we decide to re-open it.
Our DC office, located at WeWork, has shared its COVID-19 response protocol with us and all DC staff.
Until last week, our DC office was switched to full remote operation to comply with San Francisco's guidance.
As some of my colleagues in NYC know, we had started a rental agreement in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may take time.
Some of my colleagues were working with a remote for the first time.
Our remote workers know that this can be modified and we would like to advise:
Reduce the meeting time to an hour or two if it is late.
If sessions are no longer needed, consider dividing the lessons into several days.
To clearly define the course, to have a clear subject line and to send out the transcripts in advance.
Rather than video being the primary focus, apps like Google Docs and Zoom facilitate instant interaction and sharing of information.
Allow the CEO to chair each meeting, with a person who oversees the interview and follow-up of the agenda and a person who records the meeting (or collaborates with others in writing the meeting minutes).
Email technical support if you need a reliable helicopter.
Eat a simple diet to maintain good health.
Go to the #remoties channel on Slack to report any challenges you have with your task.
The work of the Staff Review Group reviews the guidelines for the online training sessions to help recruit and increase the workforce in the Society.
Last week, we asked all funded organizations to suspend Wikimedia public fundraising activities such as a training program for new web authors, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We told them that we know that requiring them to stop these activities and follow other instructions makes it very difficult to complete the fundraising activities they have set out to do and that no one will punish them for delaying or changing their goals.
Next week, we will follow up on further guidance on Wikimania and other local and regional meetings in selected areas.
The general perception of global organizations is sadness about the shutdown but there is comfort, understanding and the ability to focus on their own organizations, Wikimedia, etc.
Therefore, CRT is creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and monitor the information we share.
Maintain communication on COVID-19 issues
We will send out invitations to your calendar next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for an extraordinary staff meeting.
We will use this time to update you, answer your questions and spend more time with you.
We are all part of this pandemic and we are here to help each other as much as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to access the contents of this email and other relevant information about COVID-19 on the Wiki Office.
CRT will continue to update these pages and all information will be in one place.
We are also looking for ways to keep in touch with staff in countries currently affected by the pandemic.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, operations or internet issues or anything else you need help with, please do not hesitate to contact us and work with CRT.
We are here to help you coordinate activities as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, please email Bryan Judan, our Global Chief Human Resources Officer.
None of these changes should be interpreted as a resignation from our job or responsibilities.
Rather, it is to show that our work and responsibilities today are likely to change in ways that have never been seen in the past.
These are steps we believe are necessary to help each other keep going, to do our jobs with the help they need and to provide a service the world can rely on.
The work we had planned will be there waiting for us until that time comes.
At this time, we are in the process of helping each other and finding time to do important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make it work and we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you are well when needed.
Now you should wash your hands and not touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and all other members of the Management Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a hormone-producing protein that is bound to the outer membrane (cell walls) of cells in the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 modulates the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (((1-7) making it a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease.ACE2 also serves as a portal to the circulation for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-con 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
ACE2 contains the N-terminal portion of peptidase M2 and the C-terminal portion of renal acid-carrying collectrin.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I protein, with its active hormone receptor region located on the surface of lung cells and other cells.
The extracellular segment of ACE2 is cleaved from the intercellular segment by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting protein is dissolved into the gastrointestinal tract and then excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is expressed in many tissues: ACE2 is expressed in the cell walls of primarily type II cells of the lung, small intestine, vascular and vascular cells and vascular cells in many tissues.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to regulate the ACE level.
ACE is produced by angiotensin I and angiotensin II inhibitors that narrow blood vessels and reduce blood pressure.
ACE2 also removes carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into angiotensin A in the major blood vessels (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down peptides such as [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also activates the amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and plays a role in the development of the immune response protein Hartnup's disease.
As a transmission protein, ACE2 acts as a key gateway to the cell walls of some coronaviruses, namely HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the association of the uplift of SARS-CoV S1 protein and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface is associated with endocytosis and the migration of the virus from its enzyme site to the cell surface.
This pathway also induces the S protein to act by cleaving TMPRSS2, which is being investigated as an important treatment.This led to the idea that reducing ACE2 levels in cells could help fight the disease.
However, many professional organizations and regulatory agencies have recommended that ACE inhibitors be maintained in place to prevent the use of approved ARBs.
A review of the most recent and extensive review published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% lower risk of pneumonia compared to controls".
Furthermore, "the risk of asthma was reduced in patients at high risk for infection treated with ACE inhibitors, particularly in patients with heart disease and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in deaths from asthma, although the results were not significantly greater than the risk of asthma infection overall".
ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and appears to improve pulmonary blood flow and oxygenation in areas affected by bacterial pneumonia.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the onset of effects (time) of 24 hours.
Several studies have identified that rhACE2 may be a promising treatment for people with resistance to the renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitor) or for conditions in which angiotensin II circulation is elevated.The use of rhACE2 has been studied in a clinical trial for the treatment of chronic respiratory disease.
COVID-19 identifiers are mobile phone applications designed to help identify contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, for example through a contact tracing ("number") process that may have been in contact with an infected person.
Many programs have been developed or are widely recommended for use, with support from governments in some provinces and territories.
Many frameworks for building interaction-aware software have been developed.
Concerns about privacy breaches have been raised, particularly in the context of location-based systems for application users.
A less intrusive alternative to this is to use Bluetooth-enabled data interfaces to connect to other mobile phones using a nearby app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would be rolling out the app to support Bluetooth media-based apps and be immediately installed on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has rolled out an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China.In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app, developed by a large community of IT and communications experts, is available as an open source information source for the government.North Macedonia has launched "StopCorona!", a Bluetooth-enabled app that detects close contact with severely infected people and provides immediate response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is pending approval from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the contact tracing app had reached the advanced stage of development and was expected to be available for distribution in the coming weeks.Similar programs are being planned in Ireland, and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing mobile apps based on the Singaporean TraceTogether and Russian BlueTrace.Russia is planning to launch a lockdown application for COVID-19 patients in Moscow, which will ensure that they stay indoors.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security policy at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of practical problems that mobile application-based systems can cause, including the illness and health implications and the inability to achieve their intended outcomes if the use of these applications is limited to a small population.
To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful coronavirus testing apps, Apple has set a limit on the types of companies that can upload coronavirus testing apps to the App Store, allowing only "publicly licensed" or in other words trusted companies.
Google and Amazon have similar restrictive policies.
Individuals have expressed concerns about mass surveillance using mobile technology, particularly whether the coronavirus surveillance measures will be lifted once the pandemic is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other human rights organizations have issued a statement calling for a reduction in the use of such surveillance.
The organizations have identified eight governmental guidelines for their projects:
The inspection must be lawful, necessary and proportionate to the purpose for which it is carried out ";
the extension of the period of review should include clauses indicating when it will end;
information should only be used for COVID-19-related purposes;
security and confidentiality of information that must be protected and demonstrated for protection on the basis of evidence;
controls using technology must be non-discriminatory or disproportionate;
any publication must be based on law;
there should be a mechanism to combat bullying and help people prevent it;
"The active participation of all relevant stakeholders, including public health professionals and disadvantaged groups, is required.The German Center for Technology (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also developed a list of priorities.
The Google/Apple system to address the issue of continuous monitoring decides to remove the tracking of infected users from their systems when such tracking is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted a mobile-based tracking system for infected people instead of mobile technology, eliminating the need for mobile tracking and the possibility of being untraceable.
In Israel, a screening system for a mosquito-borne infection has been approved.
A browser-based tracking system with access to personal location information has serious privacy concerns.
However, not all electronic data storage systems require access to location-specific personal information; many systems have been developed to ensure privacy and use databases only when there is a need to share information (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-technical mobile system was used to track down infected individuals.
Instead of using a dedicated technology installed on a mobile phone, data was collected using a variety of methods including mobile phone usage, SIM card activity and SMS notifications to people with severe infection problems on their mobile phones.
In addition to using this information to alert affected people, the government also introduced a local access policy, which was made possible by changes in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to anyone using a variety of mobile technology and websites. Countries including Germany have used both national and national systems to provide privacy-related information.
As of 6 April 2020, no commentaries have been published.
A well-designed privacy-sensitive tracking system based on data from at least 2013 was developed on 7 April 2020, with more than a dozen expert groups investigating privacy-sensitive measures, such as the use of Bluetooth (BLE) technology that allows users to share information with nearby phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a powerful combination of national and community-based approaches and is not uniform in its operation.Cities-based approaches include the Data Privacy Check (DP-PPT), Temporary Contact Number (TCN), Celebration Contact Number (CEN), Privacy-Respected Contact Number (PACT) and others.
In this way, the personal data of identified individuals is kept private, and the identification of contacts is done digitally.
The Privacy Team at the MIT Media Lab is continuing to develop robust data breach warnings, systems that maintain the confidentiality of personal information and use geographically targeted tracking to gain information about the spread of COVID-19.
This is based on research from Apps Gone Rogue: Privacy Shield released in March 2020. Another announced solution is the Tracking of Infected by Enigma MPC, a privacy-focused software development company, also developed by the MIT Media Lab.
A reliable tracking system uses electronic devices to help users share location information and health-related information with health authorities without compromising privacy.
On 5 April 2020, teams with similar backgrounds and often conflicting compliance issues established the TCN International Platform, which aims to unify and provide a global platform for mobile tracking technology, allowing for a broader range of applications.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had implemented a virus tracking system using government technology.
On 10 April 2020, Android and iOS mobile device manufacturers Google and Apple announced that they had a secure tracking system, a system that the companies claimed was based on privacy principles, which combines Bluetooth Low Energy and other cloud-based technologies that protect personal information.
They also announced the role of the technology in the process.
Google and Apple announce that the technology is intended to be used in three phases:
Collect resources to help governments develop privacy-compliant technology to help them track people who have been infected.
The introduction of this feature in iOS and Android devices is a solution that Google and Apple plan to introduce to address the issue of self-regulation by first rolling out the feature to other existing devices, and then phasing it out once the pandemic is over.
Drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching, is the process of taking an approved drug to treat a disease that is different from or has a different effect than the disease being treated.
This is the current line of research to develop a reliable and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research is focused on developing a vaccine against COVID-19 and a vaccine for the virus. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 active vaccines currently undergoing clinical trials.

WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the list of medicines for global trials.
Remdesivir was developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences also found that Remdesivir can target viruses that have not yet entered the body, including viruses that can replicate, respiratory, immune, and coronaviruses.
A common challenge in treating viral infections is their drug-resistant nature due to their morphological changes that increase the severity and infectivity of the disease.
Recent studies suggest that remdesivir may have strong antimicrobial activity. Several studies are ongoing, including two at the University of Cleveland Hospital; one in patients with mild and one in patients with severe disease.
Three clinical trials are currently underway on vitamin C transfusions in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19; the first is clinical and controlled (China, Canada) and the second is uncontrolled (Italy).

It is also used in the Italian trial.See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine for the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine is available, a number of studies are being conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that no vaccine was expected for SARS-CoV-2, the virus' causative agent, for 18 months.
Five vaccines were still in Phase I trials in April.
COVID-19 was first identified in December 2019.
The global outbreak began in 2020, prompting a massive investment and research effort to develop a vaccine.
Many companies are using existing drugs to develop a vaccine that can fight SARS-CoV-2.
Since April, CEPI's primary focus in vaccine procurement has been speed, capacity, recruitment, and global availability.
In April, CEPI experts reported that 10 different technologies are currently under research and development in early 2020 to develop a vaccine that is effective against COVID-19.
The current approaches in Phase I research include:
The genes (DNA and RNA) in Phase I of the vaccine study are: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral cells (Phase I of the vaccine study: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
According to CEPI experts in April, approximately 115 vaccine studies are in the early stages of development, including 78 confirmed clinical trials (79, according to the Milken Institute), and at least 37 announced, but unknown (suspected or in development).
Phase I-II trials measure quality and efficacy, are generalised, closely monitored, and are conducted in multiple locations, while avoiding errors and identifying acceptable doses.
Phase III trials involve a large population, including a control group, and evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in preventing disease, while also assessing whether other adverse reactions to the vaccine are reduced to a tolerable level.
Of the 79 vaccines currently in development (approved in early April 2020), 74 had not been tested in humans (still in the early stages).
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying a vaccine that could modify viral cell structure to help the immune system.

On March 25, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced their plans to develop a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, the U.S. Army Health and Human Services Research Center at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Technology, both located in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans to test the vaccine and begin Phase I trials by July 2020.
On 5 March 2020, the Ministry of Health in India announced that it was developing 11 vaccines and that it would initially take at least one to one and a half to two years to produce a vaccine.
On 5 March 2020, Medicago, a healthcare company based in Quebec City, Quebec, announced the development of a novel coronavirus vaccine funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine is still undergoing laboratory testing, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had allocated a large amount of money exclusively for the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, a move that was strongly condemned by the German government.
On 5 March 2020, Pfizer announced a collaboration with German company BioNTech to develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine, designated BNT162, is currently undergoing testing and clinical trials are scheduled to begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, in Italy, Takis Biotech, a healthcare company, announced that it would receive the results of the trials in April 2020 and begin human trials of the vaccine immediately.

Other CEPI partners that have invested in the development of COVID-19 vaccines include Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and the University of Queensland.
In March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that experts had begun animal testing of the vaccine.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a COVID-19 vaccine based on a blood clot.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of receipt of the Chinese order.
In late March, the Government of Canada announced C$275 million to fund 96 COVID-19 response projects, including a number of vaccine projects at Canadian institutions and universities, including those being developed by Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced that C$192 million had been allocated to the production of a COVID-19 vaccine alone, with the aim of creating a "vaccine warehouse" with more vaccines available for use in the event of another coronavirus outbreak.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced that they were testing the PittCoVacc vaccine, which may lead to a COVID-19 vaccine, in mice, and reported that SARS-CoV-2 S1 antibodies derived from MNA genes showed the ability to produce antibodies [in mice], which began to show up as early as 2 weeks after administration".
On 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo's School of Pharmacy announced that it was developing a DNA-based vaccine that could be injected through the nose.
Using a viral antibiotic, DNA will be engineered to be introduced into the virus to produce a virus-like molecule that is not a problem, which will stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry, and three universities collected data to acquire IBM's personal computers, as well as other computer technology products from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have a wide variety of side effects, often called undiagnosed side effects.
This means that they may have a positive effect in addition to preventing disease.
Another Australian trial is recruiting 4,170 doctors to participate.
Vaccines under development are likely to be of poor quality or not effective.
Recent studies evaluating the efficacy of vaccines against selected COVID-19 strains, such as ACE2 mice and monkeys, suggest the need for level 3 immunity maintenance measures to manage the virus and international collaboration to comply with safety guidelines.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested on animals.
As of 2020, no vaccine or treatment for SARS and MERS had been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
As reported by studies in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of SARS vaccines and medicines was a priority for governments and health agencies worldwide.No MERS vaccine was approved.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was hoped that ongoing research could provide a viable way to develop vaccines and medicines to prevent MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine had completed Phase I human trials, and three others were in development, all of which are viral, two from the Adenoviridae (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) strain, and one from the MVA (MVA-MERS-S) strain.
The social media spread rumors that COVID-19 was already known and that a vaccine was already available.
The trend in social media is to focus on the already existing strains and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the respiratory viral infection SARS-CoV-2.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell and smell, and abdominal pain.
Symptoms are present for five days but can last anywhere from two to fourteen days.
While most people infected with the virus show mild symptoms, some have respiratory problems and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 have recovered.The virus is transmitted by contact, usually through the saliva released when a person coughs, sneezes or talks.
When these droplets are released by inhalation, they usually fall to the ground or onto an object rather than infecting a person at a greater distance.
People can also contract the disease by touching the virus and then touching the face, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive for up to 72 hours outside.
It is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although it can also be contagious before onset of symptoms and during the pre-exposure period.The most reliable test is the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) using a nasal swab.
It is mandatory for a person with suspected infection to wear a mask.
Guidelines for wearing masks for all vary, with some authorities advising against them, others recommending them.
Currently, there is no known vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
There have been inter-individual cases in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms including fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Severe symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, facial numbness, difficulty walking, redness of the face or lips; it is important to seek medical attention immediately if these symptoms occur.
It is rare to have symptoms that include respiratory problems such as coughing, sneezing or sore throat.
Symptoms of the upper jaw such as vomiting, jumping and wheezing are commonly seen in the upper jaw.
Patients in China first developed symptoms of chest congestion and a rapid heartbeat.
For some, the disease can be so severe that the person may become short of breath, have multiple organ failure, or even die.
This is called the onset of symptoms.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people develop symptoms at a time that may be within 11.5 days of exposure to the infection.Reports suggest that not everyone who is infected will develop symptoms.
The role of asymptomatic infections is not yet known; however, basic information is that they can infect others.
The number of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown but is being studied, based on data from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of all infected patients are discharged from hospital as asymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began listing the cases on its daily case report on 1 April; of the 166 cases reported that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The saliva can carry large amounts of the virus.
Talking loudly produces more urine than speaking softly.
A study in Singapore found that coughing with your mouth uncovered can cause dripping up to 15 feet (4.5 meters).
Although the virus is not transmitted through the air, the National Science Foundation suggests that it is possible and air from isolated rooms collected was tested positive for the virus.
Medical procedures such as colonoscopy and CPR can cause a respiratory leakage that can lead to infection.
While there is some speculation about whether a mother can transmit the virus to her unborn child, there is little evidence to support this. The virus is only contagious when people show symptoms; there is a small chance of transmission before symptoms appear.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although the transmission mechanism is not yet known, a person can infect two to three people.The virus lives in the environment for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus lived for one day on board, about three days on plastic (polypropylene) and hard metal (AISI 304), and four hours on 99% soft metal.
However, this can vary with temperature and humidity.
Soap is a disinfectant that, when used properly, can kill viruses; soap destroys the viral proteins, blocks their action and removes them from the body or the environment.
Other uses include benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a pesticide), but they are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were collected two days after admission to hospital.
Five of the six patients tested positive for high levels of the virus on the first test, and the sixth tested positive for high levels of the virus on the second test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARS-CoV-2 is a novel respiratory infectious disease virus that was first identified in Wuhan in three subjects with respiratory problems associated with respiratory illness.
All of the features of SARS-CoV-2 are present in the coronavirus strain.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, killing the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
COVID-19 is primarily a pulmonary disease, as the virus reaches the body through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) , which is expressed in large quantities in the lungs.
The virus uses its spike (horn-like fat) to bind to ACE2 and then enter the cell.
12% of patients admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, were diagnosed with severe heart failure and this is common in severe cases.
The incidence of cardiovascular disease is higher due to inflammation and immune system damage that occurs as the disease progresses, but cardiovascular disease can be associated with an infected heart with ACE2 receptors.
ACE2 is a fast-acting viral and affects cardiac function.
Patients in the ICU with COVID-19 had problems with blood flow restriction (31%) and vascular damage (25%), which were associated with a lower chance of recovery.Stanking of COVID-19-infected patients showed deterioration of respiratory tract (DAD), as well as pulmonary tumors.
Although SARS-COV-2 can be ACE2-bound in the body and in the respiratory tract, COVID-19 patients may show symptoms of severe inflammation.
In particular, T cells produced by GM-CSF have been shown to interact with IL-6-induced inflammation in COVID-19 patients.
The test revealed immune cells in the victim's body that were infected with the virus.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has introduced a number of diagnostic tests.
The most reliable method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test samples are taken from the respiratory tract using nasal swabs; however, oral and oral swabs may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be performed, but require two blood samples taken within two weeks of each other and the results are of limited immediate value.
Chinese researchers isolated the coronavirus and released the results to the world to independently produce a PCR test for viral infection.
As of 4 April 2020, some antibody tests were underway (which could indicate a persistent infection or past exposure) but were not intended for widespread use.
Chinese testing experience has shown an efficiency of 60% to 70%.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the testing site on 21 March 2020 and it is scheduled to be operational by the end of the month.Test guidelines published by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital outline a method of testing for infection based on clinical evidence and the impact of the outbreak.
Initially, infection is usually characterized by the hiding of viral cells, which accumulate, isolate from the host and then spread.
As the infection progresses, it spreads through the airways, creating a pathway (clogging the airways) and accumulating.
There is limited information on microscopic imaging and the nature of COVID-19.
The following are the viral profiles of the cadavers:
Symptoms: swelling of the airways, swelling of the areas around the heart, closure of the airways
Three types of serious viral viral infections have been identified:
Mild shortness of breath: fluid-filled tumors in the lungs, growth of airway cells, abnormal respiratory tumors, tumor bursts and the formation of various tissues.
acute asthma: diffuse respiratory arrhythmia (DAD) and diffuse arteries.
DAD is a major cause of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and blood vessel blockage.
Respiratory diseases begin to ease: accumulation of air in the airways and lungs
Bleeding: internal bleeding (DIC); the formation of new blood cells in the blood
Measures to reduce the spread of infection include staying indoors, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, cleaning the respiratory tract, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends that people cover their mouths with a clean cloth when coughing or sneezing or apply a hand to the front of the wrist when no cloth is available.
It is important to wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommends that people wear face masks when leaving their homes to prevent the spread of infections caused by people who do not show symptoms.Distance measures are aimed at limiting close contact between healthy and infected people by closing schools, workplaces, restricting travel and restricting public gatherings.
The guidelines state that people must maintain a distance of 6 feet to 1.8 meters.
There is no known cure for COVID-19. As a vaccine is expected to be available in 2021, the best way to combat the pandemic is to implement measures to reduce new COVID-19 infections known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are obviously contaminated, before eating, after coughing, sneezing, or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a 60% chloride-based antibiotic for use when soap and water are not available.In areas where access is limited, the WHO has recommended two alternative doses.
This class of medicines includes a pesticide known as ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is a disinfectant; it is not a "hand sanitizer".
Glycerol is also added to the formula.
Treatment is offered in a variety of settings, including intravenous, oxygenated, and re-energised procedures for other organs affected by infection.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people with suspected infection wear a face mask.
ECMO has been used to treat respiratory failure and is still in high demand.
People are encouraged to be hygienic, take care of their health and eat a healthy diet to boost their immune system.
Alternative treatment options may be used for people with mild symptoms of infection.WHO and the National Health Commission of China have issued guidelines for the care of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
The U.S. Urology and Respiratory Care Centers have collected and published information on the treatment of this disease from a variety of institutions (IBCC).
As of April 2020, there is no known cure for COVID-19.
To manage symptoms, medical experts recommend using paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen in the early stages of the disease.
Measures should be taken to reduce the spread of infection, especially in clinical settings when performing activities that may involve respiratory exposure, such as inhalation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends that healthcare providers who care for COVID-19 patients be placed in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) while maintaining appropriate contact precautions, avoidance of contact, and wearing a face mask.The CDC provides a list of guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent infection.
These include: PPE, a mask, a mask, a mask, and even a mask.It is recommended to use a respirator, if available, instead of a mask.
N95 masks are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has approved emergency use (EUA) masks.
They are designed to protect wearers from airborne contaminants such as dust but their effectiveness in preventing viral infection is not well established.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks, or, in rare cases, hand-held masks.
Most COVID-19 patients will not experience severe reactions to the extent of needing oxygen or other respiratory support, but some may need it.
Clinical studies are underway on the types of respiratory devices that could be used to replenish oxygen in COVID-19 patients, and a potential alternative to the use of needles or other inhalants is being developed.
It is not known whether the two treatments produce the same results in acute cases.
Some doctors prefer to continue using ventilators when available because this method reduces oxygenation compared to the use of airway syringes.The infection is more common in very elderly people (over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries have a shortage of beds, which creates a challenge in dealing with the increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
One study in China showed that 5% were admitted to the intensive care unit, 2.3% needed oxygenation and 1.4% died.
In China, 30% of COVID-19 hospitalized patients receive intensive care.
The use of ventilators continues to be a challenge due to the increasingly severe respiratory problems caused by COVID-19.
A number of PEEP devices are needed to help restore oxygen to patients to reduce the risk of injury and respiratory obstruction.
The mechanisms of these PEEP devices are not available in traditional devices.
Research on potential therapies for the disease began in January 2020, and several drug trials have begun.
Remdesivir is the promising treatment.
While it may take until 2021 for new drugs to become available, several of the experimental drugs are already being used to treat other conditions or are already being studied.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in patients with severe infection.
The WHO has invited volunteers to participate in studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of experimental drugs.The FDA has recently approved a new short-term option for use of performance enhancing drugs in patients with apparent life-threatening conditions.
No FDA studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy or safety of this treatment for acne.
In February 2020, China launched mobile technology to combat the spread of the epidemic.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The technology is able to detect the presence of infection in the environment using monitoring data, so that nearby people can be infected.
Any user of this technology can also see the position of other third parties using the technology.
Singapore not only advises quarantine and notifies local health authorities when a case is detected.South Korea and Taiwan use mobile phone tracking, facial recognition, mobile phone tracking and human-like devices to track cases.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed technology companies to monitor the mobile phones of suspected infected people.
This decision was made to implement a quarantine policy and protect those who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom also provided mobile data monitoring services with the support of the Robert Koch Institute, a German government research and prevention organization.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to identify violations of quarantine guidelines.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulo Gallera was told by telecommunications companies that "about 40% of people are still walking".
The German government held a 48-hour meeting with more than 42,000 computer scientists.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, called on the world to find ways to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience severe depression due to quarantine, travel restrictions, drug reactions, or fear of the disease itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor, who said that "isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress and poverty have a significant impact on people's mental health and wellbeing".
The disease may show few or no symptoms, which is similar to other respiratory illnesses or the flu.
People with mild illness can recover in two weeks, while those with severe illness can take three to six weeks.
Pregnant women are at a similar risk of COVID-19 as other viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but the prevalence of COVID-19 in pregnant women is unknown. COVID-19 can cause respiratory symptoms in some people.
Some people with COVID-19 may develop severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that can lead to shortness of breath, mental health problems and multiple organ failure.
The complications of COVID-19 include systemic pain, blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidneys and spleen.
Hemorrhaging, especially in the dark, was reported in 6% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while kidney problems were reported in 4%.
Between 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have shown an increase in dark transaminases.
The report also states that the average time between onset of symptoms and death is 10 days, with five of these being hospitalized.
However, patients admitted to the ICU spent up to seven days in the hospital before dying.
In a recent case study, the time between onset of symptoms and death was estimated at 14 days, with an average of 6 to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8%, while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
Tests on patients who died from lung disease showed that the lung tissue was damaged by a tumor.
Respiratory problems suggested that the virus was mutating.
The lung image appeared to be associated with severe respiratory problems (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, atrial fibrillation or cardiac arrest was reported.
A March report from the US found that 89% of those hospitalized had other conditions.Health and socioeconomic factors may also contribute to mortality.
The mortality rate varies from region to region, but also due to problems with the methodology.
Neglecting the number of mildly symptomatic cases may increase the mortality rate.
However, the fact that many deaths are associated with other complications may make the age of death unlikely.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and 2.4 times more likely to become ill or die than nonsmokers.The long-term impact of the pandemic on people with other diseases has been questioned.
Hong Kong hospital authorities found a water retention of between 20% and 30% in the lungs of recovered patients, and CT scans showed lung damage.
This also means that they should continue to be cared for after discharge from intensive care.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether the infection caused people who recovered from the epidemic to develop long-term immunity.
It appears that the protection is still valid, based on the nature of other coronaviruses, but there have been cases of COVID-19 infection after being declared cured of the coronavirus.
These people are more likely to be satisfied with the remaining tissue in their bodies than they are to be infected a second time.
It is suspected that the disease is uninfected and of animal origin, and can be transmitted by organisms.
Its exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the disease was transmitted from person to person.
A study of 41 COVID-19 patients, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, revealed symptoms that began to appear on 1 December 2019.
The WHO officially announced the onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures have been taken to count the number of deaths.
These figures vary depending on the region, time period and number of samples collected, capacity of health systems, treatment options, when the outbreak began and demographic characteristics including age, gender and general health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 epidemiological code U07.1 to laboratory-confirmed deaths from SARS-CoV-2 and code U07.2 to patients with COVID-19 but not laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global mortality rate is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the CFR, which is the ratio of people with positive infection to those with disease, and the IFR, which is the ratio of people with positive infection (tested and untested) to those with disease.
These statistics are not time-based and are based on the specific population of cases treated.
If all infected individuals do not immediately start producing antibodies, the appearance of these antibodies can provide information on the number of infected individuals.
At the peak of the outbreak shortly after it arrived in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small community of 4,600 inhabitants, had 80 (1.7%) deaths.
In Gangelt, an epidemic spread by the Carnival festivals, infected young people, resulted in fewer deaths, but not all COVID-19 deaths were reported as such.
In addition, the German health authorities were not discouraged.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have immune system problems, as shown in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were reported to have died from COVID-19.
Epidemic outcomes and mortality rates differ between men and women.
The male mortality rate is higher; studies in China and Italy show.
Men in their 50s are at a higher risk, with a difference between men and women who were only 90 years old.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The reasons for the sex differences are unknown, but may be due to their physiological and behavioural characteristics.
Differences in male-female immunity, a lower incidence of female smoking and a higher incidence of male-to-female heart disease, including heart attacks at a younger age than women, may contribute to higher male mortality rates.
In Europe, 57% of the new cases were male and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were male.
As of April 2020, the US government had not started collecting sexual health data on COVID-19 infections.
Research on viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affects men and women differently.
A large number of doctors, especially pharmacists, are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared the name of the pandemic as COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, virus VI, D disease, and 19 indicates when the outbreak was first detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid naming a specific region (e.g. China), species or population group, in accordance with international naming guidelines to prevent misuse or disparagement.The virus that causes COVID-19 is a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus causing COVID-19" in official communications.
Both disease and virus are referred to as "coronavirus".
In Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were both referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO announced 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as provisional names for viruses and diseases in a 2015 enforcement action against the use of place names in virus and disease names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were announced on 11 February 2020.
Due to a lack of market capacity, some companies are producing medical devices such as nasal swabs, respirators and respirators.
For example, when a hospital in Italy was in urgent need of ventilators and the attendant failed to arrive on time, a local factory quickly produced 100 of the needed ventilators overnight.
After the first positive case of COVID-19, rumors, misinformation, misinformation about its origin, development, prevention, treatment, etc. began to circulate and spread rapidly online.
Humans can transmit viruses to other animals.
Studies have failed to confirm viral replication in pigs, cattle and poultry.
There is no proven cure or vaccine for the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the WHO launched a "SOLIDARITY Trial" to evaluate the effectiveness of four existing drugs suspected to treat the disease.
There is no vaccine, but several clinical trials are underway.
Preliminary studies of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are being used because both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human tissues.
Three vaccines are currently being studied.
First, researchers want to develop a full-blown vaccine against the virus.
Using the virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to activate the immune system to detect the presence of a new COVID-19 infection.
The second step is the use of subunit immunization, which aims to create a vaccine that allows the immune system to detect the presence of subunit viruses.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focused on a horn-like protein that helps the virus to incorporate ACE2 elements.
The third method is based on DNA or RNA, a novel method of making vaccines.
The quality and efficacy of these investigational vaccines are yet to be tested.On March 16, 2020, four volunteers in Seattle began a trial of the vaccine.
The vaccine contains cells derived from a virus that can cause disease.The addition of antibodies has been suggested as a viable way to develop a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but there is still a problem.
As of April 2020, more than 300 vaccines are in clinical trials.
Seven trials were conducted on the most commonly approved anti-malarial drugs, including four on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Chinese research is focusing on conventional antiviral drugs, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries due to be published by the end of April.
As of April 2020, there is an ongoing clinical trial of COVID-19 medications.Many commonly used antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and a combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon beta.
As of April 2020, there is increasing evidence of remdesivir's efficacy.
Patients treated with remdesivir showed improvement.
Phase III trials are underway in the United States, Canada and Italy.Chloroquine, an alternative treatment for malaria, was studied in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, the public is being called to do other similar research.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Center for Viral Diseases, while recommending a daily intake of one gram, notes that doubling the intake can cause serious complications including death.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA provisionally approved the confidential use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine by physicians treating COVID-19 patients.Class 7 guidelines include the use of interferon, ribavirin or umfenovir to manage COVID-19.
The initial information suggests that large doses of ribavirin are required to fight SARS-CoV-2 before it can enter the organism.
Nitazoxanide can also be used for a virus that has entered the body and is later being studied after detecting a small amount of SARS-CoV-2.The study suggested that a primary receptor-mediated protein type 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for SARS-CoV-2 to enter the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have revealed strong limitations on the use of these drugs without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not eliminate SARS-CoV-2 from the body without any known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokines can cause complications during the onset of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may be cytokine resistant.The National Health Commission of China has listed tocilizumab as a potential drug after a small study.
In Italy, a Phase 2 trial is underway which includes a national trial after positive results in patients with chronic illness.
A blood test for cytokines is also performed to determine the growth factor, which is suspected to be the cause of some deaths.
In 2017, the FDA approved the use of interleukin-6 receptor antagonists based on research into the treatment of other-cause steroidal disease, known as CAR T cell therapy.
To date, there is no evidence that tocilizumab is effective in treating CRS.
Research is underway to provide purified and fully synthesized antibodies from COVID-19 patients to those who need them as a non-invasive alternative to immunosuppressant antibodies from another person.
This approach was tested on SARS but was not effective.
Viral neutralization is a previously thought technique in which immune systems from another person can combine to fight SARS-CoV-2.
However, other techniques can be used, such as boosting or increasing the immune system.
Alternative therapies using human immunosuppressants, such as the use of laboratory-derived immunosuppressants, are being developed.
A blood donation system should be added, which is a system that collects blood from rich individuals and contains antibodies to the virus, to allow it to reach the body more quickly.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of diseases that have only nine symptoms.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Central Hospital of Wuhan, was infected and died of COVID-19 after the virus was declared to have broken out.
