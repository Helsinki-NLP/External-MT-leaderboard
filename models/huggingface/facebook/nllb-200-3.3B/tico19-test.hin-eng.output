Rapidly increasing cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative prevalence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows a similar trend in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries, with different stages depending on the country.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients who will require health care, especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases with unknown pathogenology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, China reported the novel coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as the pathogen.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a more serious disease requiring hospitalization while in the remaining 6% of cases there is an observation of a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 is ca 4%.
In this study, we assess the trend of cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare it to Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK with Italy during 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 further expanded geographically and currently the activity of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world has surpassed this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
The first European confirmed COVID-19 cases as per the WHO case definition were reported in the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, among people returning from China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported between 31 December 2019 and that date, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases and cumulative prevalence
In the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), only official sources such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO receive the count of reported COVID-19 cases from each country of the world, updated every day at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the trend of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and compare them to the disease in Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active COVID-19 cases, we have thus calculated a 14-day condensed cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases, taking into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also displayed the cumulative number of reported cases in each country as of 8:00 AM on 15th March 2020 as compared to Italy for the period 31st January - 15th March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
The trend of short 14-day cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follows that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the overall cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and accelerated around 28 February 2020 (Supplementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK saw the same upward trend in cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 (Supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
This specifically shows that as of 8:00 am on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy's cases only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trend in the cumulative prevalence of COVID-19 suggests that the pandemic is growing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in national public health responses and countries possibly having different case definitions and different protocols for selecting patients who should be screened for COVID-19 as required, including confirming their capture and testing.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected areas of Italy reported a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had already reached their maximum capacity.
Hospitalization and/or intensive care unit admissions of COVID-19 cases are currently only available at EU/EEA level for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (figures not shown).
They should however be collected in a phased manner to supplement the current surveillance data which focuses on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010-11 study found a wide gap in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 population in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
The prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases with estimates for each EU/EEA country and UK related to the risk of intensive care bed capacity of &gt; 90% is provided in the sixth update of ECDC's acute risk assessment on COVID-19.
As cases are still clustered in some areas of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve defined regional populations, information on cases and intensive care beds should be made available primarily at the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Experience from Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is accelerating in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should thus prepare themselves for the situation of continued community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and the increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring health care, especially intensive care, as is happening in the affected areas of Italy.
As indicated in the recent ECDC acute risk assessment, with the shift of approach from containment to mitigation, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is required to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as if not implemented in a timely manner, the anticipated rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly.
The Acute Risk Assessment also lists public health measures to address the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have little opportunity to further enhance their containment efforts and reduce the pressure on health care to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Failing this, it is very likely that health care systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a sharp increase in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has so far killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophe for humans.
Like its homologous virus SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted by bats and produce similar symptoms by the same mechanism.
Although COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapidly growing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article attempts to provide a topical and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, causology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While there are still many questions to be answered, we hope that this review will help in understanding and eliminating the deadly disease.
Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unexpected and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people who were requested to stay at home for the entire holiday and for several weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of the Novel Viral Disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); hence, on February 11, 2020, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The pandemic started in Wuhan, China and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, there have been over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients dead due to the virus.
WHO has warned that COVID-19 is the enemy of humanity number 1 and possibly more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months after the first report on 7 January 2020, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment have been published, isolating many patients and sequencing the virus.
The review attempts to summarize the research progress on a new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 to SARS and other diseases caused by CoV, such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far in relation to prevention and prognosis of the disease as well as some other yet vital questions.
CoVs have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens to humans with the mainly common cold 4 producing about 15% of the common cold.
However, in this century we have encountered two highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally saw outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with terrible morbidity and mortality.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in the recorded history of humans.
As shown in Figure 1.1, swarms of pneumonia, whose origin was unknown, were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
The sequence of the CoV was released seven days later.
The first fatal case from Wuhan was reported on 15th January 2020.
During this time, the epidemic spread rapidly to nearby cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infections were reported among health care providers, which indicated that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was put into lockdown with all of its public transport closed.
The first clinical study on the disease on 24 January reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was believed to be the origin of the infection from an unknown viral source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
By the time of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries worldwide (Figure 2). 2).
As the situation is escalating, the final extent and severity of the outbreak is yet to be determined.
A more updated picture of the pandemic was provided by the following multi-centre study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients on 11th February 2020 (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
People of all ages were infected with SARS-CoV-2, but mainly those aged 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected persons were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age and only 14 infected persons were below 10 years of age.
Men (0.31/100,000) were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 spread mainly in Hubei and its surrounding herds.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4. 8 (3. 0 - 7. 2) days.
The mean time from onset to death was 9.5 (4. 8 - 13) days.
The baseline reproduction number (R0) was 3. 77 (95% CI: 3. 51 - 4. 05), and the adjusted R0 was 2. 23 - 4. 82.
The number of infected people increased sharply before 23 January 2020, which coincides with the widespread traffic before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate for patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and inverted viruses with single-stranded RNA.
They can be divided into four generations, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma and delta of which alpha and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The sheath tip (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively and then fuses to the membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cell mass; after replication of the viral genome, the envelope forms genome RNA virion-containing vesicles with glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, which are then fused into the plasma membrane for release of the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new variant of Beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic similarity in 10 sequenced samples collected from Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, the origin of the outbreak.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
By transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the ultra-thin segments of the human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a recipient for SARS-CoV, along with SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 with greater weakness than SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 produces less severe infections in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also make novel small proteins encoded by orf3b and secreted proteins encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenesis and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 has no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al. reported the cryo-EM structure of a full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in a mixture with the amino acid carrier B0AT1.
They found that the mixture, which had free and closed compositions, was compiled as dimers and the ACE2-B0AT1 mixture can bind the two S proteins which provides evidence for the identification and infection of CoV.
B0AT1, a drug for suppressing SARS-CoV-2 infection, may be a clinical target for investigation.
Primary and intermediate nutrients
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels respectively.
By comparing SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the primary host of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate nutrient helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans is unknown and the transmission route is yet to be clarified.
Ji, et al., proposed the snake as a carrier of the virus from bats to humans involving similar recombination with the S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China indicated that pangolins - a long-muzzled, ant-eating mammal often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate nutrients of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic similarity in the CoV found in pangolins.
However, the spread of the 1% difference across both genomes is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are awaited for concrete evidence (Fig.
The physical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are mainly not yet known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in artificial ambient dry environments for 48 hours and 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays for 30 minutes at 56 °C; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorinated disinfectants, paracetic acid, chloroform and other fat solvents can effectively inactivate the virus, but not chlorhexidine.
The entire human population is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore vulnerable to the novel virus.
No detailed studies regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported at present.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure (Figure 4).4).
Normally, after the virus enters the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system from the C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR), and prototype recognition receptors (PRR), including the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which limits the spread of the virus and accelerates the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid immune responses.
Soon, the adapted immune response is involved in fighting the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play a critical role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to assist the protective cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by killing T cells.
Trivalent resistance, including supplements and immunosuppressants such as C3a and C5a, is also essential to fight viral infections.
For example, the antibodies isolated from the recovered patient inactivated MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the overreaction of the immune system generates a very large number of locally free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst cases multiple organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized by herd initiation is more likely to affect elderly people and pregnant women with a high susceptibility.
It is common that people who come in contact with a greater number of viruses or whose immune functions are mixed are more likely to be infected than others.
Based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most commonly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
As mentioned above, a recent study based on the demographics of 8,866 cases found that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period and thus prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who have come in contact with or become infected with the virus generally require a 14-day quarantine.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19 which may be accompanied by no symptoms or may include other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, nasal discharge, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced shortness of breath and/ or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients experienced a rapid increase in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidification and congenital coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and severe fever even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities should be screened for the virus in time for early diagnosis.
The demographic study at the end of December 2019 observed that the percentage of symptoms was 98 for fever, 76 for dry cough, 55 for respiratory distress and 3 for diarrhoea; 8 patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of herd - family herd and herd - induced transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
By comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms.
However, far more than COVID-19 patients, 80% of them required ventilation support and this is consistent with the higher lethality of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat palsy (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Fever (99-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), shortness of breath (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and sore throat (13-25%) were the major symptoms observed in SARS patients and about 14% - 20% of patients required ventilation support.
The COVID-19 mortality rate was 2% as of February 14, when the number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
By comparison, the mortality rate of SARS as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases based on the June 2012 demographic study.
The first study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23 higher while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison table of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater transmissibility than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The beginning of the swarm is usually from a single family or a single group of people or a vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients within the last two weeks of onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and recovered patients discharged from hospital can carry the virus again, which warns of extending the quarantine time.
Peripheral white blood cell (especially lymphocytes) counts are normal or low in patients in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count including lymphocyte count 1×109/L and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and toxicity with white blood cell count 4×109/L were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in their blood and most patients had elevated C -reactive protein and erythrocyte deposition in their blood.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin breakdown present in the blood, was increased and the lymphocyte count steadily decreased.
Most COVID-19 patients have abnormalities in chest radiography and are indicated by bilateral spotted images or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop unusual pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, gas exchange is severely compromised due to uncontrolled inflammation, mass accumulation and progressive fibrosis.
The side effect of type - I and type - II pneumocytes is that they reduce the surface activation level and increase the surface tension and thus reduce the capacity of the lungs to inflate and increase the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst findings of chest radiography often parallel the most severe stage of the disease.
The first diagnostic analysis on COVID-19 on 18 February 2020 looked at the disintegration of pneumocytes in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, the formation of a haloin membrane and the perforated leakage of lymphoid cells, and multicellular polycellular cells that were consistent with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the key criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which could accelerate the pandemic, it was started to be used for the diagnosis of clinical manifestations in China on 13 February 2020 (which was no longer dependent on RT-PCR alone).
The same situation happened with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is necessary and essential to make an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zheng Group reported a protocol for detecting SARS-CoV-2 using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology, which detects artificial SARS-CoV-2 RNA segments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) without the need for any elaborate equipment, using a dipstick.
If verified in clinical samples, it is hoped that the new technology could dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience.
Due to the lack of experience with the novel CoV, clinicians may primarily provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients by trying out various therapies previously used or proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2) 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Plasma from recovered patients was also proposed for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop immunes and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 initially attacks mainly the lungs and possibly to a lesser extent other organs that express ACE2 such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory failure and failure remain the major hazards for patients and are the major causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms may be assisted by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used in the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
Also, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ function are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms result from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
A cytokine storm is a type of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These provoke immune cells to release a large number of cytokine free radicals which are the major causes of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, IL6-resistant monoclonal antibodies, have been used for the treatment of cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm include modification of the T cell - directed immune response; blockade of IFN -γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppression of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not useful in severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can produce serious side effects, especially non-vascular osteoporosis, dramatically affecting the diagnosis.
However, short-term courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses are recommended with caution in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
As of the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue given intravenously has been found to be effective in a US patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug initially developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Malburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential inhibition of other monoclonal RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has made the compound available to China to conduct two trials on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results are highly anticipated.
Also, baricitinib, interferon -α, iodinovir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combined therapy with iodinovir / ritonavir.
Interaction with other drugs used in patients with these therapies should be carefully monitored.
Plasma and immunity production from recovered patients
There is a long history of accumulating blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to prevent healthy individuals from contracting the disease.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients has a relatively high level of immunity to the pathogen.
The immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign substances are antibodies that identify and directly inactivate molecules unique to the pathogen.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was transplanted into 10 critically ill patients.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours with reduced inflammation and viral load and better oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, until specific therapies are developed, validation and clarification are required to propose the method for large - scale use.
Also, despite therapeutic effects, some of the risks associated with plasma should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially life-threatening toxicity.
The concentrations of antibodies in the blood are generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat critically ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific immunes so quickly to fight a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic code encoding the effective immunity or to test for effective immunity to the necessary proteins of the virus.
Thus, we can increase the production of immunostimulants at a rapid pace.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects depend mainly on the combination of different components in different formula based on TCM principles for diagnosis of a disease.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or irrelevant because it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the leading alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Ji Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
Several provinces in China saw the highest recovery rates in treatment of COVID-19 with 87% of patients using TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, where only about 30% of COVID-19 patients used TCM, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison as many other impact factors, such as number of patients and severity, must be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020 Bolie Zheng and colleagues published a study comparing Western Medicine (WM) treatment only and combined treatment of WM and TCM.
They found that the time it took for the WM+TCM group to normalize body temperature, go symptomatic and require hospitalization was significantly shorter than the WM alone group.
Most impressively, the symptomatic rate of morbidity (mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group only (7.4% vs 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM+TCM group (8.8% vs 39%).
However, more controlled trials are still awaited for the efficacy and safety of TCM at larger scale and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to identify the mechanisms of action and if possible to elucidate the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients experience a great deal of fear from the highly contagious and deadly disease and those quarantined also experience lethargy, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as corticosteroid induced insomnia, may result in greater restlessness and mental distress.
In the early stage of the SARS outbreak, many psychological disorders were reported, including persistent stress, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic excitement, mental symptoms, delirium, even suicide.
Mandated contact tracing and quarantine as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak may make people more anxious and concerned about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected persons and persons in contact with them, as well as the general public.
Psychological support should include setting up multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with continuous and accurate updates about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal cells and susceptible organisms to infected humans and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by the rising number of viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to generate long-lasting and potent inactivating immunity and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
The live-tunned vaccines have been evaluated in SARS live-virus models.
However, the vivo efficacy of these candidate vaccines in elderly people and lethally challenged strains and their safety against zoonotic virus infection are yet to be determined before the start of any clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS gradually ended 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
Conversely, sporadic cases and swarms of MERS continue to originate in the Middle East and spread to other areas due to the presence of zoonotic sources in the epidemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS using inactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and subunits of recombinant protein have been developed and some have been evaluated in zoonotic models.
Developing safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is a critical task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, the long time required in vaccine development (average 18 months) and the difficulty of overcoming due to the dynamic variations of CoVs is challenging.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to manifest its entire clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without symptoms of other diseases.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with higher morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, it is necessary for health-care agencies to develop a diagnostic model to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the diagnosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
In the study of 8,866 cases, COVID-19 occurred mainly in the age group of 30-65 years, of which 47.7% of patients were above the age of 50 years, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying complications and complications and were significantly older than those not requiring such care (at median age of 51 versus 66), indicating age as a predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: More men than women have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 (0.31/100,000 vs 0.27/100,000), as noted above.
Injuries and complications: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac damage and atherosclerosis.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive colangiocytes that can cause liver disease in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease have a deep correlation and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C - reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of the inflammation or tissue damage and has been proposed as a predictor of disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels with severity and diagnosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
Also, increased lactate hydrogenesis (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine kinase (CK) can also help predict the result.
These enzymes are widely expressed in multiple organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional indicators of heart or liver diseases.
Major clinical symptoms: Radiography of the chest with other problems and the periodic progression of clinical symptoms should be considered for prediction of outcome and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As mentioned above, steroids are immunosuppressive drugs commonly used as adjunctive therapy in infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
As high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from non-vascular osteoporosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in COVID-19 patients for low doses and short term.
Mental stress: As mentioned above, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress during the COVID-19 outbreak as they often endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Psychological counselling and long - term support is essential to help these people recover from stress and return to normal life.
As per demographic studies so far, COVID-19 has different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
As well as replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and, like other colds-causing CoVs, produces mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection.
Therefore, infected patients may generate large quantities of virus during daily activities in the early stages or incubation period with great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was thought to have occurred when patients were very sick, while most transmissions did not occur during the early stage.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Large-scale efforts are currently underway in China, including lockdowns in Wuhan and surrounding cities and ongoing quarantines of almost the entire population, in hopes of disrupting transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are dramatically destroying the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, which points to a downward trend in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by the end of March and the downturn phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be far more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set the model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
The Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in both the mid-turbinate and throat phalanges of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks ago, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a recurrent case like influenza.
However, there are promising signs from China based on the declining number of new cases, which indicate that the current strategies may be working.
Initially, Ebola was predicted to have one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 could weaken in infectivity and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 pandemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Figure (Figure 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is also highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing and possibly direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in faeces, which also generates new fecal-oral transmission possibilities.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases, including 17 patients with pre-existing disease and 40 health care providers, were probably due to hospital-acquired infections.
Therefore, great care should also be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, co-workers and patients who are in contact with or next to infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear a mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (Series # 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent droplets of fluid from potentially infected person into the air or stick to the surface of things, from where they can be passed to others.
However, only N95 (Series # 1860s) masks can prevent viruses as small as 10 to 80 nm from entering the respiratory tract, with only 5% of viruses being able to cross completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can also cross five surgical masks placed one above the other, health care providers in direct contact with patients must necessarily wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks, but not surgical masks.
Along with masks, healthcare providers should wear fitted isolation gowns to further reduce exposure to the virus.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
A physician was infected with SARS-CoV-2 on 22 January 2020, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered the body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
In affected or potentially affected areas, the general public is strongly advised to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and to limit contact with potentially infected persons.
Three feet is considered the appropriate distance for people to stay away from the patient.
These activities are effective measures to reduce the risk of infection as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to the human world, as reported on 7 January 2020, it may have been highly cautious to China based on the deep memory of the SARS outbreak in 2003 due to its extreme similarity to SARS-CoV.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of Wuhan's Center for Disease Control consoled citizens by saying that the novel virus has low human-to-human infectivity and limited reproductive capacity and there is no problem in preventing and limiting the disease.
This message has relieved the public of fear, especially as the country was preparing for the Spring Festival and the critical time to limit the disease to a minimum in Wuhan passed.
Disease control agencies in China can learn a lot from this and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be very careful when making public announcements because every word matters to citizens and can change their attitude and decision; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from clinics rather than waiting for formal information from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive to limit a potential epidemic at an early stage rather than trying to console the public; and (4) issue frequently targeted and effective exercises to increase public awareness of the epidemic and periodically examine and improve the response system of society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries in the world as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the appearance of recurrent SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are necessary to limit the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than younger people, and the severity and mortality rate in the elderly is also higher than that of young people.
The mortality rate of SARS is higher than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when asymptomatic, while SARS patients often do so when they are critically ill, which makes it much more difficult to limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partially explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly and with greater prevalence than SARS-CoV.
Routine RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may be positive for the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Despite such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, there are still many serious cases to be solved, which are:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot reach the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from bats.
The original host, say, which species was the intermediate in the transmission of the virus from the bat to humans?
Without finding the answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission and the outbreak may never happen again.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and then undergo pathological transformations?
Does the virus bind to ACE2-receptor cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the pandemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during transmission to humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, slowing down like SARS or becoming periodically recurrent like the flu?
This is necessary, but it may take some time to find the answers to the above and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic and get our lives back to normal as soon as possible.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Due to mutation and adaptation, coronaviruses (CoVs) and their hosts (including humans) have evolved together over thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have completely reversed the situation, demonstrating the devastating and lethal nature of HCoV infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought CoVs back into the limelight and has shocked us with its more infectious capacity than its sister SARS-CoV but reduced pathogenicity.
HCoV infection is a zoonotic disease and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs will be of use to us.
Most HCoVs originated from bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.
There is also information on the intermediate cell hosts of some HCoVs.
The identification of animal nutrients has direct implications in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigating the interactions of CoV-nutrients in animals can also shed important insights on the pathogenicity of CoV in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the current information about seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of discovery as well as on zoonotic origin and intragenic transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast different HCoVs from the point of view of sequential evolution and gene recombination of viruses.
The current COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
The need for successful nutrient replacement and the implications of the gradual evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are from the family Coronaviridae which includes groups of enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses, which harbor the largest genome of RNA viruses at 26 to 32 kilobases, were named CoVs due to their crown-like morphology under the electron microscope.
Structurally, CoVs have segmentless genomes that have a similar structure.
About two thirds of the genome contains two large overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are converted into the replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyprotein is further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins named nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Several lineage-specific ancillary proteins are also encoded by different lineages of CoVs.
Based on variation in protein sequences, CoVs are divided into four lineages (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which the beta-CoV lineage is predominantly HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Genealogical evidence has shown that bats and mosquitoes are the gene sources of mostly alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major hosts of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed species barriers and emerged as some of the most important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 alpha-CoVs.
The five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and the other SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually produce mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and newly identified SARS-CoV-2, are highly pathogenic, producing severe lower respiratory tract infections in relatively more patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a higher likelihood of hyperpulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated in the mid-1960s from nasal secretions of patients with colds.
Since then, more information has been gathered by detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which produce self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until before the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that infection by HCoVs is generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, infecting more than 8000 people with an untreated case fatality rate of approximately 10%, is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak created a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread elsewhere in the world.
2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoogenetic origin from bat, rat or domestic animals.
Many evidences support the sequential evolution of all HCoVs from bats, including viruses that are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but show extreme genetic variation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented huge medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoogenic origin of HCoVs provides the framework for understanding the natural history, propulsion and binding factors of species invasion.
This could guide or make accessible the discovery of the host, intermediate and amplifying zoonotic (animal) genes of SARS-CoV-2 with a significant impact in preventing future spread.
In this review, we present an overview of the genomic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the ancestral viruses of HCoVs are non-pathogenic in their natural host cells, but become pathogenic after intracellular transmission in the new host.
We will also review the trend of gradual evolution of HCoVs in which the increase in infectivity is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from nasal secretions of infected patients with the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated from several infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven HCoVs have been identified in the past decades.
A brief summary of the chronology of the history of discovery of HCoV (Table 1) will be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infections, which subsequently adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell lines.
Headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat with fever and cough were observed in 10 to 20% of patients infected with HCoV-229E.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from a sequential pathway in the brain of a milking rat and from organ culture.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those of infection caused by HCoV-229E which is characteristically unrelated to infection with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread worldwide and are likely to be predominantly transmitted during the winter season with a cooler climate.
Typically, the period of gradual development of both of these viruses is less than a week, followed by an illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study of humanitarian volunteers, mild colds developed in healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E.
A few patients with immunocompromised conditions have severe lower respiratory infections.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, was the first well-documented HCoV pandemic in human history and the causative agent, the third HCoV discovered, is SARS-CoV.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic spread across several countries and continents with 774 deaths and 8,096 cases reported.
Apart from the most transmissible ones, it was estimated that about two secondary cases could be due to each case with a sequential development period of 4 to 7 days and the maximum viral burden appearing on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially show symptoms such as muscle aches, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by shortness of breath, cough and respiratory distress as subsequent symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and increased creatinine kinase are common laboratory-associated abnormalities of SARS.
Transmitted air cell damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase in macrophages are also seen in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation afterwards.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal tract, usually with cytokine storms, several organs including the liver and kidneys can also be infected in these severe cases, which can be fatal, especially for patients with compromised immunity.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the indicator patient who had travelled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, much effort has been put into HCoV research.
HCoV - NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Cold-colds, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63-induced diseases.
In another independent study, the same virus was isolated from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it has actually spread worldwide.
It is estimated that approximately 4. 7% of common respiratory diseases are caused by HCoV-NL63 and its peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the inhibitory coccidiosis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old elderly man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with severe asthma outbreaks.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory illnesses.
HCoVs from all four communities have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents of unknown cause have occurred as in the rare case of the more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which has recently been reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
Typically, once these HCoVs have acquired the ability to efficiently transmit and sustain themselves in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient in Saudi Arabia who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure.
While most laboratory confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spread in close relatives have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second secondary outbreak occurred in 2015 in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS, characterized by progressive severe pneumonia, are similar to those of SARS.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which has so far been seen only in MERS in HCoV-infected patients.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid to late December 2019, a pandemic cluster of pneumonia patients related to SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection due to SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As on March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide with an untreated case fatality rate of 3.4%.
Notably, the case fatality rate in Hubei China is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which appear as fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence similarity of 82%, they fall into different branches of the castrate lineage.
SARS-CoV-2 is clearly less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but more transmissible.
Asymptomatic patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and looking at the heterogeneity of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs has revealed some very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and the course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 is similar to that of SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, infection with SARS-CoV-2 exhibits features that are commonly seen during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including non-specific, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen, as is the case with SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs are also characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
On the one hand, the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as the infectivity of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be verified whether the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after it progresses to humans like the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in at least some conditions like SARS-CoV is yet to be clarified by future studies.
It is also particularly interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can behave seasonally like cases of community-acquired HCoVs.
Nevertheless, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including infectiousness, pathogenicity and persistent transmission after transmission to humans will be influential on the eventual outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
All four community-acquired HCoVs, which produce mild symptoms, have been well adapted in humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both of the ancient HCoVs may have survived the pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and those that cause humans to develop severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
To occur, the accumulation of such adapted mutations inhibiting nutrient restriction factors must replicate HCoVs in humans to a sufficient extent.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the more likely it is to become fully adapted in humans.
If it adapts well, it will be difficult to prevent transmission to humans by quarantine or other infection control measures.
Over the years, four community-acquired CoVs have been transmitted to the human population, causing colds in immunocompromised patients.
These viruses do not require the presence of zoos.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well in humans and their transmission in humans cannot be maintained.
They need to persist and spread in their zoogenetic cell and possibly find a chance to spread to receptive human targets by one or more intermediate and growing hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four community-derived HCoVs.
At least at present it is very infectious like community-acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will be fully adapted in humans and transmitted to humans without any cell or intermediate animal hosts.
Before discussing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the sequential evolution of HCoVs, natural, cellular, intermediate and enhancing nutrients.
An animal is a sequentially evolving carrier of an HCoV if it harbored a very close ancestor with a high level of nucleotide sequence similarity.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted to this nutrient and non-pathogenic.
Similarly, cellular nutrients provide HCoVs with a continuous and long-term shelter.
In both cases, the host becomes naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its ancestor virus.
Conversely, if HCoV enters a new intermediate host immediately before or around entry into humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate nutrient can act as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of enhancing nutrient by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and then transmitting it to humans to increase the level of human infection.
An HCoV can go into an end-infection if it cannot maintain its transmission within the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCoVs can also adapt to intermediate nutrients and maintain locality for a long time.
In this case, the intermediate nutrient becomes the natural cellular nutrient.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the SARS indicator case had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence tests indicated that there was a higher prevalence of SARS-CoV-resistant IgG in animal traders than in the general public.
Masked palm civets (Pagam larvata) and raccoon dogs in live animal markets were identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are largely similar to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after all the sewerage of the markets had been killed.
However, it has been reported that most masked palm civets from wild or farms that do not come into contact with live animal markets were SARS-CoV negative, which suggests that masked palm civets may only be serious as a medium-sized nutrient and not as a natural host of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the different animals in the markets of Guangzhou are anti-SARS-CoV resistant, the possibility cannot be ruled out that many species of small mammals may also be intermediate enriching nutrients of SARS-CoV.
These all appear to be the final host of SARS-CoV.
Follow-up research of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a very close bat CoV called SARS-related Rhino-Rh Bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for SARS-CoV-antibodies and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are the nourishers of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats but none have been isolated as live viruses other than WIV1.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the host of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 extracted from bat fecal samples was demonstrated to use bat, seagull and human ACE2 as receptors for cellular entry.
Interestingly, the serum of recovering SARS patients was able to inactivate WIV1.
As of now, WIV1 is the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Despite the great similarity in these two viruses, it is generally assumed that WIV1 is not the closest ancestor virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the closest cousins of SARS-CoV.
Classical analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV used the same nutrient receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
The RNA-based RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are genetically close to bat beta-CoV counterparts identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been detected in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% nucleotide sequence similarity.
Therefore, bats may not be the closest host to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that camels with humps, like camels of Middle Eastern origin, in many African countries are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific inactivation antibodies.
Live MERS-CoV, similar to the virus found in humans, isolated from nasal swabs of humpback camels, indicating that camels are the authentic cell hosts of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV were observed with a generally mild but very high virus clearance.
Significantly, infected camels not only excrete viruses through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal - oral route, which is also the main route of virus excretion from bats.
However, questions remain as there is no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms of several confirmed cases of MERS, possibly due to human-to-human transmission or any unknown transmission pathways including the species of animals harboring MERS-CoV.
CoV RaTG13 isolated from bats belonging to the Rhynolophus species shares 96.2% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2 from bats.
As with the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is sufficient to establish an ancestral relationship.
That is, bats may not be the closest host of SARS-CoV-2 until nearly identical bat CoVs are found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed in the wholesale market of Huanan seafood that were linked to several early cases of COVID-19, indicating a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (human javanna) may also harbor ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% similarity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
They are in two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the genealogical lineage, one of which shares a more common Gram-binding region (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2 with 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are highly variable despite the greater sequence similarity across the gene.
Earlier studies of pangolin illness also reported the detection of a cluster of viral overlapping DNA from lung samples, which was similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used several different combined methods and manual curation to generate a partial genome sequence with a full length viral genome of 86.3%.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate zoonotic hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence variation between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Also, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The path of gradual evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has yet to be established.
Where the highest sequence similarity has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest genome-wide sequence similarity.
It is a very hypothetical idea that the extreme similarity between the pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 is due to selectively mediated convergent sequential evolution.
An alternative proposal is in favor of recombination between pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in a third wildlife species.
As the driving force of gradual evolution, recombination is widely present in beta-CoVs.
The nearest zoogenetic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still unknown.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Cogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while ancestral viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mosquitoes.
It has been reported that a bat CoV named ARCoV.2 (Applachin Ridge CoV) found in three colour bats of North America was closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although camellia are also its suspect intermediate host.
For clarity, the current information on the genetic origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The ethnographic analysis has provided evidence of interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
An epidemic of respiratory infection was observed when HCoV-OC43 crossed species from domestic animals to infect humans around 1890.
The history of intragenic transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs have been found to be quite close to HCoV-229E.
One of them is alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several evidences support the transmission of the virus from bats directly to humans.
First, humans, not alpacas, have had contact with bats in a shared ecological habitat.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alpaca.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are heterogeneous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, Alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas inherit HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bat rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus are the direct sources of human pathogenic viruses.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, where bat alpha-CoVs are gene pools of HCoV-229E, alpacas and humped camels may be intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of intergenic transmission from bats to the humpback camel and from the humpback camel to humans.
The sequential evolution of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has been further strengthened by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pedigree of virus species for interspecies exchange and interspecies transmission of genetic fragments.
Long life, dense colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity all provide favorable conditions for bats to be ideal virus dispersers.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has been introduced into camels for several decades.
It has been well adapted in these camels which have changed from intermediate nutrient to stable and natural cell nutrient.
MERS-CoV is very mildly pathogenic and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
It has sporadic transmission to humans and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV because its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be the last nutritive of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, like the sevet in the case of SARS-CoV.
The multiple possibilities of intragenic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans are to be accepted or refuted in future studies.
First, bats may be hosts of SARS-CoV-2-related viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecological habitat with bats by killing or mining coal.
Secondly, pangolin may be one of the intermediate enhancing nutrients in which the SARS-CoV-2-related virus was newly introduced.
Viruses are contracted by killing humans and consuming game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including pets, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Surveys of immunocompromisers in domestic and wild animals are required.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been exposed to both bats and pangolins.
The animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still being investigated.
Apart from the different types of animal nutrients, three key factors in relation to viral are also important in smoothly overcoming the species barriers of CoV.
First, their relatively high mutation rate in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rate of CoV can be considered moderate to high with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year per site, depending on the stage of CoV adaptation in the new host.
CoVs have proof-reading exoribonucleases, the deletion of which can also lead to extreme variability and attenuation or reduced viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue remdesivir is thought to inhibit CoV replication by this exoribonuclease and RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents being tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rate of CoVs is one million times higher than that of their hosts.
Also, mutation rate is often higher when CoVs are not well adapted to the nutrient.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is clearly lower, indicating a high level of adaptation in humans.
It may have already adapted to another nutrient close to humans.
Along with SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV which has adapted well in humpback camels.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic drift will rapidly inactivate vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA in CoVs puts additional plasticity on the genome for genome mutation and recombination, increasing the likelihood of intracellular co-serious evolution, which is beneficial for the emergence of novel CoVs when conditions are right.
This is supported by a richly unique open reading frame and protein functions encoded at the 3rd end of the genome.
Third, CoVs change paradigm repeatedly and randomly during RNA replication by a unique 'copy-choice' mechanism.
In the nutrient acting as the character mixture, the fiber change is usually during CoV RNA transcription.
The same full length and highly subgenomic RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Genotic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in zoonotic CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus - host interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host is another important factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is seen as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analyses of the virulence between human and silvery SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoV is considered to be highly adaptive to different hosts, particularly with mutations on the RBD of the S protein.
Typically, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is selected by the nutrient-dependent immune response with intensity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the 318th to 510th amino acid on the S1 segment that binds to human ACE2 as well as its co-receptors for viral entry.
The RBD of SARS-CoV is able to recognize ACE2 receptors of various animals including bats, seabirds, mice and raccoon dogs, leading to interspecies transmission of the viruses.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were isolated from human and sievet viral isolates in RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor-bound core for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The RBD of the Seavett SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations which may increase the attraction of spike protein interactions with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be important in viral adaptation in humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular host with SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein indicates that its S protein may have altered its binding similarity to human ACE2.
In fact, cryo-EM studies indicate a 10 to 20 times higher affinity for this binding than for the binding between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S proteins.
It would also be interesting to determine whether another co-recipient would be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but from a different part of S.
Several other HCoV receptors exist, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after intragenetic transmission from their zoos.
The result of intragenic transmission of HCoVs is controlled by other nutrient dependence and restriction factors, in addition to cellular receptors.
The variation of these nutrient proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCoVs, such as bats, humpback camels and mice, may hinder interspecies transmission.
Successful intragenic transmission of HCoVs requires the capture of nutrient dependence factors and reversal of nutrient restriction factors.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this critical area of virus - nutrient interaction have yet to be identified and characterized.
Non-biased genome-wide screening of nutrient dependence and restriction factors of SARS-CoV-2 using the latest technology of CRISPR can be fruitful.
The rise of novel HCoVs: a return to basics
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunity for emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as gene pools for HCoVs.
Also, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also lead to the development of HCoV and serve two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to alter viral symptoms significantly.
Of the SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation in humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but found to encode diverse ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide extinction characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been observed in isolated strains at the beginning of the human pandemic.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered an adaptive mutation that promotes cell replacement.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with alpha- and gamma-CoVs lineages, with a very large number of small recombination regions identified in RNA-based RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in parts of nsp9, mostly nsp10, and nsp14.
Similarly, it has been observed that the pandemic MERS-CoV experienced recombination events among different lineages, which occurred in humped camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other zoonotic CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can cause unintended changes in the viral genome, possibly due to viruses released from selection suppression, such as by the nutritional immune system.
An example of the effects is the loss of full length ORF4 in these HCoV-229E prototype strains due to two-nucleotide deletion.
While the intact ORF4 can be seen in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV shows a single nucleotide entry, causing a frame shift.
Last but not least, the gradual evolution of novel HCoVs is also due to selection pressure in their cell hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were identified when bats were infected with CoVs which indicates mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats seem to have adapted well to CoVs structurally and physically.
Defects in the activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats, for example, effectively reduce the pathogenicity caused by CoVs.
In addition, inhibition of natural killer cell activity in bats is suppressed by the regulation of the natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression level of the major tissue conformation complex class I molecules.
Further, the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by the higher metabolic activity of bats may suppress CoV replication and affect proof-reading by exoribonuclease, thus providing selection pressure for the production of highly pathogenic virus strains upon entry into new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains can also be developed by recombination, which may lead to new protein or protein characteristics for nutrient adaptation.
Therefore, it is not a coincidence that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or produce mild symptoms in ruminants such as bats and camels.
They reproduce strongly without showing a strong nutrient resistance response.
This is the secret behind why asymptomatic carriers are seen and what causes severe cases in human infections.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to immune response and overactivation of the cytokine storm, in which the more severe the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has been isolated from CoV replication.
The same strategy of isolating the immune response may have beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2-antibody therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon in humans should be beneficial at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Also, the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
By this logic, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The spread of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same general theme that generated SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Whereas bat beta-CoV has 95% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV, bat-CoV also has 96% nucleotide similarity with SARS-CoV-2.
While seabirds and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the closest intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Surprisingly similar pangolin beta-CoVs have been found from SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoVs may have contributed gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is deliberately created or accidentally man-made.
CoVs have been in the news due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has greatly changed our understanding of the animal cell populations of HCoVs in zoonotic origin and standard transmission.
The prevailing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are bats and transmission to humans is by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection arises due to contact between humans and civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing civets there should have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, pangolin should be removed from the wet market to prevent zoonotic transmission due to the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains to be clarified in future investigations.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been entering the camel for several decades.
These camels are an important means of transport for the local people as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
A comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures to prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS.
As we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new gene variants can emerge to cause outbreaks.
Divergent zoonotic CoVs are circulating in wildlife.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are highly diverse.
There is a high probability that these genetically modified CoVs will undergo further evolution and recombination, leading to the emergence of new CoVs that are more infectious and/or lethal in humans in the future.
To reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals, the culture of eating wild animals should be abandoned in some areas of China.
With the tough test of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plans should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural habitat as long as there is no possibility of spreading.
Although bats have many characteristics that help spread viruses, the possibility of contact between humans and bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are educated about how to stay away from bats.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential for better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal to human transmission and future outbreaks.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonotic disease is to keep humans away from the natural cell ecosystems of zoonotic viruses.
Many pieces of the puzzle of the SARS-CoV-2's genomic origin are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share the same ecological habitat.
Secondly, if bats play a direct role in human transmission, then it must be determined how humans come in contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal is to serve as a true intermediate nutrient, it must be clarified how it interacts with various species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as many mammals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or any other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its ancestor viruses which are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued investigations in this field will clarify the sequential evolution pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19.
On 6 February 2020, our team published the Rapid Consultation Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Infection, and this guideline provides appropriate context for our experience and global response to the pandemic.
Although Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also being continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guideline and provided the latest diagnostic criteria of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" as per the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines of COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, there has been an outbreak of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is now officially named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus is named as acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO has identified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed quick consultation guidelines and which have been published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and experience of clinical practice; therefore, strategies for diagnosis and treatment are also being continuously updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have released a total of seven editions with fundamental changes in some of the references.
Now that our guideline has been commented on by Zhou et al., they have proposed a simple marking proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guidelines and also provided valuable context for this pandemic around the world.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be updated in line with the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh trial edition) and recent studies.
As per the seventh edition (3 March 2020), any one item of the epidemiological history needs to be combined with two items of clinical manifestations to carry out a comprehensive analysis to confirm a suspected case, or if without a clear epidemiological history, three items of clinical manifestations need to be completed:
Epidemic history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infectious cases (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms, from Wuhan city and surrounding areas; (4) history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with reflective features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocytes in the early onset.
The diagnosis of the case made should be based on a suspected case with one item of pathogenic or serologic evidence that: (1) is positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a real-time PCR test; (2) the viral whole genome sequence shows high homology to known novel coronaviruses; (3) is positive for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody in a serum test; or the SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody is positive from negative, or the sequence is increased ≥4 times in the health benefit phase compared to acute phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogenic identification of blood samples was added in the fourth (27th January 2020) and fifth (8th February 2020) editions; and then the serological evidence was added in the seventh edition.
These innovations were based on the ongoing work of researchers who search for an optimal nucleic acid identification kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory system samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of various samples, and support the bringing of specific immuno-positive results into confirmed criteria.
Further, there is ample evidence that reminds us to exercise caution with patients with uncommon symptomatic and allergic reactions.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they have classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The scoring system needs to be validated in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and invite readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest tracking down and following the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also update its guidelines from time to time to offer help.
Five new deaths from COVID-19 in Bangladesh, highest ever in a single day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five more deaths from COVID-19 in a day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
As of yesterday, the number of recorded cases reported by the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh included 114 active cases and 33 people who recovered from the disease while staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded so far.
In an online news briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Mirzazadi Sabrina Flora reported that four men and one woman had died.
According to Dr. Mirzadi, two patients were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the dead were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic on 11 March.
An official at the hospital told a local news outlet, Anadolu Agency, that the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission and was being treated at Kuwait Friendship Hospital.
In an online video announcement on Saturday, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Ubaydul Qadir, said that road transport will be shut down for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
The public transportation ban started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of essential items like medical items, fuel and food was not prohibited.
The initial cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded in two people who returned from Italy on March 8 and the wife of one of them.
On 19th March, all three had recovered.
Worldwide, the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection has crossed the one million mark.
On Thursday, the total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide crossed one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
The coronavirus disease COVID-19 is being linked to at least 52,000 deaths.
The day of the record breaking event also marks the first reported case of coronavirus infection in Malawi and the first reported death from coronavirus in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was among the few countries that are still free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization has reported 10,51,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases reported in the 24 hours before 10 am (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
The US has recorded more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus, and at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported more than 1,000 deaths in the US from coronavirus infections on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced even more stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the lockdown in the city until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would continue to receive a salary without having to go to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted in favour of extending the national emergency for 15 days; the said resolution passed by 215 votes, ten members absent and one voting against it.
Saudi Arabia has imposed a 24-hour curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina; the previous curfew was from 3 pm to 6 am.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew from 10 p. m. to 4 a. m.
Ohio Governor Mike Davaine announced that the state's stay-at-home order has been extended until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduced the number of toilet paper they could buy at one time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of toilet paper that can be purchased at once in all their stores nationally to two and one packages respectively.
ALDI also imposed a one - pack limit on Monday.
These limits were posted as messages on check-out sites and on the chains' Facebook pages.
It is reported that the shoppers were shopping together for the situation of having to isolate themselves due to the fear of COVID-19.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also capped the purchase of toilet paper to one pack per order for home delivery.
Before these changes, Woolworths and Coles had imposed a ban on buying a maximum of four packs at a time on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles said in his March 8 press release that despite the four-pack ban, "many stores are still running out of stock within an hour of delivery", and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
According to a Woolworths spokesman, there was a sharp uptick in sales last week.
Costco's store in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packs last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of delivery. Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI stockpiled to make the pre-planned Wednesday special available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that while retailers should try to increase stocks, it is difficult to do so due to restrictions imposed by local councils on the timing of truck deliveries.
With suppliers trying to meet demand and the number of specials already down, Russell expects production costs to rise.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stock, some stores cannot operate the Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are stocking up every night.
He explained that toilet paper is a heavy item, so it cannot be stocked in large quantities, and then, when all the stocks are sold out, large shelves are left behind, making the feeling of scarcity even more severe.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said, "The idea is that if there were enough stuff on the shelves, and products like toilet paper and sanitiser could be bought and available in large quantities, the turmoil could probably be reduced".
The maker of recycled toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, said last Wednesday that they had run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, the company that makes Cleanex toilet tissue, and Solaris Paper, the company that makes sorbent, both insisted they were working 24/7 to maintain supply, according to a report from News.com.au.
In Melbourne, where auctions are already being reduced due to holiday buyers on Labor Day weekend, some property sellers are giving away free toilet paper to first bidders in the auction, a real estate site Domain.com reported.
The Thursday edition of the NT News, a daily published in Darwin, had an eight - page insert that had been cut up and given to use as toilet paper.
ABC Australia reported on March 3 that the stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions; they said they had no plans to ban shopping.
Russell Zimmerman further said that there is also a huge demand for other products, including masks, sanitizers, dry goods, handwashes and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the online British supermarket Okadao introduced a two pack limit on the purchase of Andres toilet paper on Sunday evening.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19, a disease caused by the coronavirus SARS CoV-2, to be a global pandemic.
The term "global pandemic" refers only to how far a disease spreads, not to how dangerous its specific cases are, though WHO discussed the need to motivate governments to take action.
All countries can change the course of this global pandemic right now.
If countries respond by detecting the disease, treating the patients, isolating them, tracking them and uniting them, said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
We are extremely concerned both by the alarming level of spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Freeden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this global pandemic is "unprecedented".
In comments published by CNN in February, he said that, "No other respiratory virus, except influenza, has been detected in the sustained global outbreak".
Gebryasis echoed this sentiment when he said, "We have not yet seen a global pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
He added that, "And we have not seen any global pandemic that can be contained at the same time".
The new pandemic designation follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, "It's only going to get worse".
The Associated Press reported that as of Thursday, there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide and more than 4,600 deaths as a result.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, which was declared a public health emergency internationally on 30 January 2020 and was declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, about 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate in China has been estimated at 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is normally about five days, but it can be from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include: washing hands, covering your face when coughing, maintaining social distance and monitoring and self-isolation for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruption, prompting the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and panic buying by people has led to widespread shortages of supplies.
Schools and universities in 193 countries are closed on a nationwide or local basis, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, East and Southeast Asian origin and other people of color, and others from areas with more virus cases.
Reduced travel and closure of heavy industry has resulted in reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan (capital of Hubei province) in China reported mass cases of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the wholesale market of Hunan seafood and therefore the virus is considered to be of an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.The earliest known person with symptoms was later found to be ill on 1 December 2019, and the person who followed had no apparent connection with the meat market cluster.
Two-thirds of the initial batch of cases reported in December 2019 were found to be associated with the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report in the South China Morning Post reported that one case was of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province on 17 November 2019, which may be the first case. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that there has been a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea with a decrease in new cases in China, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases within China for the first time.
Very few cases may have been reported, especially in people with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, with those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The United Kingdom's Chief Scientific Adviser, Patrick Valens, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected before achieving effective herd immunity.
Refers to the number of cases in which people have been tested for COVID-19, and according to official protocol whose test has been confirmed positive.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3 percent of its population, and many countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland had official policies that they should not test only people with mild symptoms.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5. 7.
Most people who have COVID-19 recover.
Those who do not recover have a time from the development of symptoms to death between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As on 10 April 2020, COVID-19 had caused deaths of about 97,000 people.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths were in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of cases had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official count of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic refers to those who died, in general, as tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who died without testing such as at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the additional deaths during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death toll.
A spokesperson for the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the alleged death toll] is underestimated", a statement that is supported by descriptive information from undercounting in the US. Such underestimates are common in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was in the Philippines on February 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, Iran, South Korea and Italy each recorded more than a dozen deaths.
As of 13 March, deaths were reported in more than forty countries and territories on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and overall health. The death-to-case ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
This number varies by region.
In China, the estimated case-to-death ratio has decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on or after 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) people who die from a disease.
These data are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Many academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection mortality rate for an overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this threshold is consistent with the results of a statistical study analyzing the effect of the first randomized trial of COVID-19 in Germany and the test on CFR estimates.
WHO claims that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically become stable and begin to decline when nutrients are no longer available for the disease", said McKeeze Boney of Penn State University.
But it is almost impossible to make any sensible predictions about when that will be.
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "is likely to remain circulating for one or two years".
According to the study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine becomes available (probably: 18 months or more)".
William Scheffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will be completely eradicated, as it is very easily transmitted" and it can "transform into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year".
The severity of the return will depend on the extent of group immunity and mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include: fatigue, decreased respiratory output (cough), decreased sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, blood discharge, diarrhea or phlegm. According to WHO, about one in six people become seriously ill and have difficulty breathing.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. Further development of this disease can lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but test results confirm infection, so the researchers have issued advice that people who are close contacts of confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the symptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is most commonly five days. An example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who had lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later reduced to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be transmitted mainly by small droplets produced during close contact and during coughing, sneezing or talking; when close contact is within 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have found that uncovered cough drops can go from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by small droplets generated during speaking which remain in the air for a longer time. Breathing droplets can also be generated during exhalation, including while talking, although the virus is not normally aerated.
The droplets can go into the mouth or nose of people who are nearby or possibly in the lungs by inhalation.
Some medical procedures such as tubal penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause respiratory secretion to be diverted and thus cause airborne spread.
It can also be spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there are also concerns that it may spread through feces, the risk is considered low.
The Chinese government has ruled out the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most infectious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible in the pre-symptomatic and post-symptomatic stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, which suggests that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed in the laboratory are present, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified by some countries during contact tracing investigations.
According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person normally infects two to three other people.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel for three days, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for four hours.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that the virus can be transmitted from animals to humans, although British authorities recommend washing your hands after coming into contact with animals, as is done after contacting other surfaces touched by an infected person.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory illness in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses present in nature.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective covering. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be a virus of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with two bat-derived strains of the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus of the serbacovirus (Chemistry B).
This is 96% similar to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13) at the whole genome level.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and viruses from humans.
In whole genome comparisons so far, the common genetic content between pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2 has been found to be a maximum of 92%, which is insufficient to attribute intermediate nutrients to pangolins.
Temporarily, infection by the virus can be detected based on symptoms, although confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) or CT images of the infected secretion.
A study in Wuhan comparing PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although it is less specific with many of its imaging characteristics being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended that "CT should not be used as a primary test to screen for or diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first version of which was released on 17 January.
This test uses the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test can be done on breath or blood samples.
Results are usually available within hours to days.
The test is normally performed on nasopharyngeal swabs, but a throat swab may also be used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests that detect immunity.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been proven sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the US has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristic image features on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pulmonary secretion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international online database of radiation findings for confirmed cases.
Due to similarities with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19 without confirmation by PCR.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and demonstrated that although imaging is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based rotating neural networks have been developed to detect the imaging characteristics of the virus with both radiograph and CT.
To prevent transmission of the disease, strategies include maintaining overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and throwing that tissue directly into the trash can.
People who may already have the infection are advised to wear surgical masks in public places.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have banned all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak or have advised against traveling.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where and how they became infected.Care providers caring for an infected person are advised to take standard precautions, observe contact precautions, and protect the eyes.Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, for which Amnesty International and more than 100 other organisations have issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log proximity to a user's other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are spreading about ways to prevent infection; for example, rubbing the nose and mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine available, although several organizations are working to develop a vaccine.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent transmission of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when their hands appear dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soaps, which burst its protective bubbles.
Additionally, the CDC has recommended the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with several solutions including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine (within one minute contact of the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface).
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care, all areas such as offices, restrooms, public places, shared electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by sick persons, etc. should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a folded elbow or a tissue when coughing or sneezing and then dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask may limit the amount and distance covered by the droplets of breath spread when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask may reduce the tendency for people to touch their face, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene". The use of masks has also been recommended by those who are caring for someone with the disease.
The WHO has recommended masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who are caring for someone with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their face.
Many countries have started encouraging the use of face masks by common individuals.
In the US, the CDC recommends the wearing of non-medical face masks made of fabric.China has recommended the use of disposable medical masks by generally healthy people, especially when they come into close contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet) or less).
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or when in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and face.
On March 16, Vietnam has requested everyone to wear face masks when going into public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for all persons entering a grocery store to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks per day since mid-March, made it mandatory on April 1 to wear face masks by passengers on trains and intercity buses.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask when going outdoors, while it has also recommended making homemade face masks for those who cannot afford to buy a face mask.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centers.
Individuals can implement social distancing techniques by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in many outbreak-affected areas.
The maximum crowd recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was sharply reduced from 250 people (if there was no known COVID-19 transmission in an area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.Older adults and individuals with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and a weakened immune system are at higher risk of serious illnesses and complications and are advised by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas with community outbreaks.In late March 2020, the WHO and other health bodies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the purpose of social contact is to reduce physical contact while maintaining either virtual or distant distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has implications that people should adopt complete social isolation rather than being encouraged to stay in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines to be used during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who has no symptoms of the virus or the virus.
Self-isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-quarantine. Several governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions have been issued in the high risk groups.
Persons who may have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Isolation is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to detect infected people as well as implement other measures to control the infection and vaccination to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are shifted to mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on the health system and society.
The combination of both the insulation and the quenching measures can be done at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures, so that the original reproductive number is reduced by 1 to reverse the pandemic. Part of managing an outbreak of infectious disease is to try to reduce the epidemic extremes, known as lowering the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and gives more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the outbreak include individual preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, face masks and self-quarantine; community measures intended to create physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also adopted a range of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea initiated mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued warnings on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected who self-quarantined and imposed heavy fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of face masks and punished the hoarding of medical supplies. Simulations for Great Britain and the US show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (reversing the evolution of the epidemic) are major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for critical health care by two thirds and death by half, but even after that, hundreds of people die and health systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is spreading in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if it is earlier), otherwise transmission may return rapidly from lax measures.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic generate social and economic costs.
No specific antiviral drugs are approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over - the - counter cold medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help to reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use may worsen the outcome.
Compounds that are already approved for treatment of several other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
According to WHO, some "traditional and home remedies" can relieve symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients has been described by WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
The European Regional Office for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and WHO have issued guidelines for transfer of resources to hospitals and primary health care services at multiple levels, including: focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling selective procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 infected patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are several opinions about where the first case (the so - called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China on 1 December 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly associated with the Hunan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one opinion is that the virus came from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, it is of zoogenetic origin. The pneumonia group with unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by doctor Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were warned by police for spreading false rumours and another doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by his superiors.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on December 31 and informed WHO.
A number of cases of unidentified pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan, resulting in investigations beginning in early January.
In early and mid January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and major railway interchange.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
As of 26 March, the US has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world. As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 people have recovered.
There is at least one case in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses include quarantine measures such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdowns) and curfews.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States or about 90% of the population are in some form of lockdown, more than 50 million people in the Philippines are in lockdown, nearly 59 million people are in lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people in India are in lockdown.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later - almost a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was detected in Wuhan on 1 December 2019; an unconfirmed report suggests that the earliest case was on 17 November.
Physician Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26, after which his hospital informed the Wuhan Jiangnan CDC on December 27.
Preliminary genetic testing of the patient's samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO was informed on the same day.
After these reports came in, doctors in Wuhan were warned by the police to "spread rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a fierce campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was called the "people's war" by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.
Described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a siege zone was declared in Wuhan on 23 January to stop movement, which was extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a makeshift hospital, the Hoshensan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, the Lichensensens Hospital, was later built to handle the additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan such as convention centers and stadiums into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government instituted additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health declarations for travelers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.

Remote working measures were introduced in many Chinese areas.
Travel restrictions were imposed in and out of Hubei.
Transportation was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed to the public.
Public movement was restricted in many cities, and it is estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.After the outbreak entered its global phase in March, Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the virus from "coming" from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted domestically in the last five days in mainland China, in this example via a passenger returning from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang informed that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been substantially halted and the outbreak in China has been brought under control.
The travel restrictions in Hubei were eased on the same day, two months after the lockdown was imposed, except for Wuhan. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders will be suspended from 28 March, with no specific details on when the policy will end.
People who wish to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic incentive packages for businesses. The State Council declared a day of mourning on April 4, starting with three minutes of national silence at 10:00 am, timed to coincide with the Qingming festival, although the central government asked families to pay respects online while maintaining physical distancing to avoid a new COVID-19 outbreak.
On 20 January 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was confirmed in South Korea from China.
The nation's health agency recorded a significant increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a crowd gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shin - chi - ji who came to Dai - gu from Wuhan were suspicious of the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, 1,261 of the church's 9,336 followers, or about 13%, reported symptoms.South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline programmes were also affected and therefore they were changed.The programme South Korea introduced was considered the largest and best organized in the world for screening the population for the virus and isolating any infected people as well as tracking and quarantining those who had contacted them.
The screening methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile apps, rapid testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test 20,000 people per day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities.South Korean society was initially divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans either signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment, claiming mismanagement of the outbreak by the government, or applauded his response.

Iran allocated five trillion riyals to deal with the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that there was no plan to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak and only individuals would be quarantined.
Plans to restrict travel between cities were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities continued before the Persian New Year Navroz.
Shia shrines in Qom were open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. During February, Iran became the centre of virus transmission after China.
Amid claims of concealment of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries found their cases linked to Iran as of February 28, indicating that the extent of the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government up to that date.
The Iranian parliament was shut down when 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus on March 3.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries, with most cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that a combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test people who had the virus by that time may have contributed to the high death rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus initially emerged as the most lax of the affected countries, and as of 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism for its perceived lack of speed and intensity in responding to the concerns faced by the public.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson advised to curb all non-essential travel and social contact, advising people to work from home where possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.

Despite doing so, the US started the testing slowly, making it difficult to understand the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
The testing was hampered by faulty test kits manufactured by the federal government in late February, the lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (by academics, companies and hospitals), and restrictive criteria (after which a physician's order was required) for people to be eligible for a test by early March.
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the US.

WHO has appreciated the efforts of Chinese authorities in managing and containment of the epidemic.
The WHO noted the discrepancy between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government has "provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of central authorities to impose a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Gallia commented that while "certainly not recommended by WHO" it was "a very important sign of commitment to contain the pandemic in the place where it is most concentrated" and called it "unprecedented in public health history". On 30 January, the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) after China confirmed human-to-extraterrestrial transmission and other increases in the number of cases, which is the first PHEIC since measures were introduced during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEIC was due to "the risk of global spread, particularly in low and middle income countries without strong health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros said that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million for strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the need to help countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people infected with the virus, even if it were to emerge".

Mike Ryan, WHO's executive director of the health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "this is a reality check for every government on earth: it's time to wake up".
This virus may be on its way and you need to be prepared", insisting that the right response measures can help the world avoid "the worst of it".
Ryan further said that the current data has not convinced public health authorities to declare a global pandemic, adding that such a declaration would mean "we are essentially accepting that every human on Earth will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned by both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inactivity".The WHO has faced major criticism as inadequate management of the pandemic, including the delay in declaring a public health emergency and classifying the virus as a pandemic.

The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with nearly two dozen members of parliament infected as well as fifteen other current or former politicians.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders on 14 March 2020 asking for help, stating that his country, due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran, is struggling to fight the outbreak. The outbreak has prompted calls for the US to adopt similar social policies in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of financing for public health.
Political analysts speculated that this could negatively affect the chances of Donald Trump's re-election in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea deteriorated due to the pandemic.

The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about shortages of medicines and medical devices due to rising consumer demand and supply disruptions.
Many neighborhoods also witnessed fear-driven shopping situations, which led to shortages of grocery essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water from shelves, reducing supply.
The technology industry in particular has been warned about the delays in transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.

This has led to a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment, which the WHO has warned will endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided daiqu shoppers with a new opportunity to sell Australian products in China.
This activity created a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was later banned by the Australian government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases and high demand for food products in Northern Italy and the Wuhan area, both regions are surviving extreme food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against hoarding and illicit trade of important products have been successful, preventing the severe food shortages that were projected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy has not seen a major drop in its significant agricultural output, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only temporarily seen in the city of Wuhan, where Chinese government officials had released stockpiles of sugar-meat to ensure adequate nutrition of the population.
Similar laws in Italy make it mandatory for food producers to keep stocks for such emergencies.

As a result, many airlines including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Quantas have canceled flights due to low demand, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry was the most seen so far.
Many train stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The timing of the pandemic also coincides with the major travel season, Chunyun, associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
A large number of events including annual New Year celebrations were cancelled by national and regional governments, as well as private companies independently closing their shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Several Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions in Beijing have been closed to prevent mass celebrations, including the Forbidden City and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These sectors accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closing schools until March, and cancelling its New Year celebrations.The retail sector has been affected globally, with store hours reduced or temporarily closed.
In Europe and Latin America, visits by retailers have fallen by 40%.
North American and Middle Eastern retailers saw a decline of 50-60%.
The number of people walking to shopping centers in March decreased by 33-43% compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world took additional measures, such as increasing sanitation, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events. According to a United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America estimate, the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million people in Latin America in extreme poverty who would not have been in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's approximately 300 million rural migrant workers are either stuck at home in inland provinces or stuck in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cut 47 million jobs in the US and the unemployment rate could fall to 32%, according to an estimate by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Several million migrant workers have been unemployed (who are paid through daily wages) due to the lockdown in India. The Angus Reed Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households have experienced some form of unemployment. 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since going into lockdown in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of the March, 4 million French workers had applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers had applied for the universal loan scheme. In Germany, nearly half a million companies have sent their workers on government-subsidized short-term work schemes called Kurzarbet.
The German short - term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and the UK.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been greatly impacted by the pandemic, which has affected the operations of organizations globally as well as individuals both employed and freelancing.
The arts and culture sector organisations tried to uphold their (often publicly funded) mission to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, to maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and to support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance spaces, and other cultural institutions across the world and in different jurisdictions were closed indefinitely, with their exhibitions, gatherings, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Recently another and rapidly increasing consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also experienced disruption. The Vatican announced that Holy Week observances in Rome, which take place during the final week of the Christian Lenten season, have been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay home rather than attend mass on Sundays; some churches have made church services available through radio, online live streaming or television, while others are offering drive-in worship.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and shrines and evacuating Christian pilgrims from St. Peter's Square, other religious bodies have also canceled services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurudwaras and restricted public gatherings.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and later closed shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as citizens to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption to the sports calendar worldwide since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, 2019-20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted the planning of the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but no further than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues worldwide have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled.
This has led to many gamblers going online, with a significant increase in the rates of new sign-ups reported in many online gambling sites. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various musical groups suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue and share work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as performing, distributing and promoting their work through live streaming of concerts or creating web-based "events".
Many online, coronavirus-themed internet memes have spread as humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, increasing prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and those with hotspots in Europe, the US and other countries has been noted.
Many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, have witnessed episodes of fear, suspicion and hostility.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) documented the racist sentiments of various groups of Chinese people around the world about being worthy of the virus or receiving the just punishment.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti - Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Online and offline help is available for the Chinese people and for those in virus-affected areas.
Following the progress of the outbreak in the new hotspot countries, the first countries in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, people in Italy may also experience suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to prevent Chinese people from entering their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese people as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported increasing levels of racist abuse as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", which was considered by critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign evacuees from Wuhan to Novi Zanjari.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, who study in major Indian cities have reportedly experienced harassment related to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, the state president of the BJP in West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God has taken revenge on them".
Later, the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata condemned the comment as "misguided". In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents was fueled by the pandemic, with foreigners described as being targeted for "foreign trash" and "disposal".
Several newspapers with paywalls removed them for part or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Scientific publishers made available a number of scientific papers related to the outbreak with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 viruses includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and detecting the antibodies produced as a response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (hemodynamics) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of people.
Immunity tests show how many people have had the disease, including those with symptoms too mild to be reported or who were asymptomatic.
The results of this test can be used to determine the exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in humans as of March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there are considerable disparities in how many have been tested in different countries.
This disparity is also likely to significantly affect the reported case fatality rate, which is likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
The real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) can be tested on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasal swab or mucus samples.
Results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
RT - PCR testing with throat swabs is reliable in the first week of illness.
The virus may then disappear from the throat, while it continues to grow in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, the sample material can then be taken from the airway inside by suction catheter or the coughing material (balgam) can be used as an alternative.
One of the earliest PCR tests using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was developed at the Charité in Berlin in January 2020, and formed the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed the test kit by 23 January 2020. South Korean company Koganbiotec developed a clinical category, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene found in SARS-CoV-2 specifically.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval of PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kits from China's National Medical Products Administration.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) real-time RT-PCR diagnostic panel to public health laboratories through International Reagents Resources.
One of three genetic tests in the older versions of the kit produced inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and caused problems in testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples being successfully processed a day for the entire February 2020.
The tests using the two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020 and till then the state and local laboratories were not allowed to initiate the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
As on 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has made COVID-19 testing available nationwide until 9th March 2020.
No volume limits were declared; the collection and processing of samples should be done in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic was informed to develop a test to detect infection with COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a high-volume test that can be performed within 3.5 hours, resulting in approximately 4,128 tests being performed in a 24-hour period with one machine.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations to Holologic, LabCorp, and ThermoFisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Shephid also received an EUA from the FDA for an examination that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of variable temperature cycles, the method can give positive results in less than five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the U.S. and Abbott wants to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. A test kit using a monoclonal antigen specifically binding to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can give results in 15 to 20 minutes, like an acute influenza test.
A March 2020 literature review concluded that "Radiography of the chest in the early stages has little clinical significance, whereas CT [Computerised Tomography] findings may be available even before the onset of symptoms".
The specific features of CT include bilateral multilobare ground-glass opacification with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subplural effects, crazy paving and consolidation develop.
Studies comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, the source point of the current epidemic, have suggested that it is significantly more sensitive than PCR despite being less specific, with many of the imaging features of CT being similar to other pneumonia and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used as a screening or first-line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for primary screening.
Part of the immune response to infection involves the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to determine the emergence of immunity in individuals 7 days or so after the onset of symptoms and to detect infection for monitoring of people.
Automated systems with high throughput in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
A single peripheral blood sample is usually used for CLT, although a series of samples may be used to look for resistance response.
A single sample of blood for PoCT is usually obtained from a skin puncture.
The first extraction step of the test is not required, unlike PCR methods. On 26 March 2020, the FDA designated 29 units that would provide information to the agency when needed and are thus now able to distribute their immunization tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitop Diagnostics received European approval for its test kits that can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
It has the capability to test hundreds of samples within a few hours and is therefore much faster than the traditional PCR test of viral RNA.
Immunizations can usually be detected 14 days after the onset of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the immunization test kits they had purchased were good enough for use.
Hong Kong developed a plan in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube, they will spit back into it and get the result of the test in a short time".The British NHS announced that they are starting a plan to test suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to the hospital or disinfects the used ambulance.In the drive-through of suspected cases of COVID-19, the health professional takes a sample while taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-through testing centers have helped South Korea conduct the fastest, most comprehensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2 that they had the capacity to perform about 12,000 tests per day in an ambulatory setting and 10,700 tests in the past week.
When the examination is ordered by a doctor, the cost is borne by the health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's total capacity is 160,000 checks per week.
As of March 19, drive - thru checks were offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
The first laboratory survey found that as of week 12/2020, including week 12/2020, at least a total of 483,295 samples were tested and 33,491 (6.9%) of the samples tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at the Technion & Rembrandt Hospital developed and tested a method to combine samples and test samples from 64 patients together if the combined sample is found positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000 square meter temporary emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Meichi language: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was launched by BGI on 5 February 2020, which can process more than 10,000 samples a day.
Taking another 5 days to build with oversight from BGI founder Wang Jian, the model found that if this screening capability had not been introduced, the number of cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the associated costs of dealing with quarantine would have doubled.
The Wuhan Laboratory has been quickly followed by the Huo-Yen Laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 2020, the total daily flow capacity was 50,000 tests per day. Multi-directional open source frameworks have been released by Origami Assay that can test up to 1122 samples of COVID19 patients using 93 tests. These balanced frameworks can be run in small labs without the need for a robotic liquid handler.
Prior to March, deficiencies and insufficient amounts of the reagent were a problem in large-scale testing in the EU, UK and US.
This prompted some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genome for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for coronavirus per capita than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to reach a larger portion of the population.
This was due to a combination of the ability to perform drive - through testing and the purchase of a population - scale mass - throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo - Yan" emergency testing laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of performing thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory in the world to operate on such a large scale outside of China.
Various testing methods targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German method and sent kits to developing countries with limited resources to produce them themselves.
Germany's method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying the availability of tests in the U.S. At the beginning of the outbreak, there were problems between China and the United States over the reliability of testing kits, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet the demand for testing and the recommendations made by health experts.
Conversely, experts point out that the widespread availability of testing in South Korea helped to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, especially in private sector laboratories, was developed over the course of several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization said that increasing testing programs is the best way to slow the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus piled up thousands of pending tests in private U.S. laboratories and the supply of foams and chemical reagents became strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy problems in its test kits.
In the United States, there was a shortage of test kits developed by the CDC; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that were preventing private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen BioEgy Biotechnology Co., Ltd., but found that the results were not accurate.
The firm said that the wrong results could be due to failure to collect samples or use the kits properly.
The Ministry of Health of Spain said it would remove the test kits that gave false results and replace them with other test kits made available by Shenzhen BioEnergy. The Czech Republic purchased 80% of the test kits from China that gave false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they should be dumped in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and they "did not use them". UK, which purchased 3.5 million test kits from China in early April 2020, announced that they were unusable.
Positive results were obtained from quarantining those who tested positive and tracing those who came in contact with positive SARS-CoV-2 patients.
At the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, researchers working in the Italian town of Vò double-checked an entire population of about 3,400 people at about ten days' intervals.
Almost half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all those with detected cases were quarantined.
The travel restrictions on the point of entry completely eliminated new infections.
By aggressively contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but without extreme restrictions such as forcibly closing restaurants and retail establishments, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic has spread in Singapore at a much slower rate than in other developed countries.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home from March 28, but schools reopened on time on March 23 after a holiday.
Many other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, have also aggressively managed the pandemic by contact tracing, internal travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns.
Statistical studies have shown that countries with more tests than deaths have a much lower case fatality rate, possibly because these countries are better able to detect only mild or asymptomatic cases.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and whose national laboratories have limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the column % of positive in tests is affected by the testing policy of the country.
Similarly, a country that tests only those admitted to hospital would have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands with the purpose of removing dirt, oil, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at "necessary times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal route.
People can also be infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important are: before and after defecation, after cleaning the bottom of the baby or changing the diaper, before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or before and after consuming raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends hand washing at the following times:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has used the toilet.
After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animals, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before providing medicine or medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The main therapeutic purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals from the hands that can cause damage or disease.
It is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important action for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including: reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the rate of newborn death in cases of home birth.
A 2013 study found that good hand washing practices in children under five years of age may slightly improve their height gains.
In developing countries, simple behavioral changes, such as starting hand washing with soap, can reduce infant mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Handwashing-promoting measures can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and that's the same as providing clean water in low-income areas.
The 48% reduction in diarrhea cases may be linked to handwashing with soap. Handwashing with soap as a self-induced behaviour in homes, schools and communities worldwide is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI).
A leading ARI, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated 18 million deaths each year.
About 35 lakh children die annually due to diarrhoea and pneumonia.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a strong habit can save more lives than any one vaccine or medical measure, which can reduce the number of deaths from diarrhea by almost half and the number of deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene measures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo which is spread through direct physical contact.
A minor harmful effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to drying of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to an itchy, flaky skin condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common among healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the fecal - main transmission of the disease: after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning the baby's buttocks (after changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and preparing food or before/after consuming raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other occasions when proper hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent transmission of disease are: before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching litter.
In many countries, the rate of hand washing with soap is low.
A 2015 study of hand washing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of households adopted the practice of hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 percent; the US had a moderate rate of 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate of 23 percent. Several methods of behavior change are now available to increase the behavior of hand washing with soap at critical times.
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
The core of this national programme includes daily flossing with fluoride, as well as daily hand washing with soap, anti-worm treatment twice a year.
It has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro - organisms from the skin can be improved by adding soap or detergent to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the obstructions in the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient skin purifier because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soils, do not readily dissolve in water.
However, adequate flow of water helps in cleaning.
Solid soaps may contain bacteria left over from previous uses due to repeated use.
Some studies looking at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap have concluded that transfer is unlikely due to the bacteria being washed off with the foam.
However, according to the CDC, "preferably, hand-washed soaps with a liquid soap drop on the palms are preferred".
Antibacterial soaps have been promoted with emphasis on the health conscious public.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants produces antibiotic - resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, with a comprehensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Therefore, even if antibacterial soaps do not produce antibiotic resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are advertised to be.
In addition to moisturizing and skin protective agents, the refined formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid), antimicrobially active benzoic acids and other skin enhancers (aloveira, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) as pH regulators. A comprehensive analysis from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that plain soap, containing triclosan, is as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps in preventing illness and removing germs from the hands.
The warm water for hand washing is not warm enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow very rapidly at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, hot, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water to remove natural oils containing soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the amount of microorganisms on the hands.
A hand sanitizer is a waterless based hand hygiene agent.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, rubbing alcohol-free water-free hand sanitizing agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, disinfectant hand rubs or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer in a gel (polymer of acrylic acid), or a moisturizer such as a liquid or foam with glycerin, for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
The combination of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity even further. Hand sanitizers with 60 to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol rubs destroy bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinoviruses, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and the coatings.
Alcohol rubber sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria after 30 seconds of application (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) and kill 99.99% to 99.999% of bacteria after 1 minute of application (4 to 5 log reduction). Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost completely ineffective against norovirus (or Norvoc) type viruses which are the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol rub should be used to completely wet or cover both hands.
The pores of both the front and back of the hands and the middle and all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
The pores of the fingers should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing both palms. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing instead of hand sanitizer rubs, especially when the hands are dirty.
The increased use of these reagents is based on their ease of use and quick-killing activity against microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are unavailable.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless lubricants and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/ or other lubricants to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with lubricants significantly reduced skin burning and dryness compared to soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Rarely allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to the additives present in alcohol or alcohol hand rubs.
The lower incidence of irritating contact inducing dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water became a draw.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not clean the hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of pathogens, because pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers is highly dependent on ingredients and formulation, and historically their performance has been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease efficacy after repeated use possibly due to progressive adverse skin reactions, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after administration.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and can use ash or clay instead.
Ash or clay may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than slowing it down.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant agent because it forms an alkaline solution in contact with water.
The WHO has recommended ash or sand as a substitute for soap if soap is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent transmission of the disease includes the following steps:
Wet hands with hot or cold running water.
Running water is recommended as basins with standing water may become contaminated, however the water temperature does not matter.
Apply the appropriate amount of soap on the hands, including the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap rather than water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and more germs are released by prolonged rubbing.
Wash well under running water.
Hands can become contaminated again by washing in the basin.
Dry with a clean towel or air dry.
Wet and damp hands are more prone to re - contamination. The areas that are most likely to be affected are the thumb, wrist, the area between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and sticky nail polishes can harbour microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotions are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
In developing countries where tap water and/or soap is not available, various low-cost alternatives can be devised to facilitate hand washing if needed, for example by pouring water and/or using ash from a hanging basin or fireplace with suitable holes. In situations of limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions are available, such as "tippy-tapes" and other low-cost alternatives.
Tippy-tapping is a simple technique involving the use of a rope-hung jug and a foot - operated lever to pour a small amount of water onto the hands and soap ticks.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some controversy over the most effective form of drying in public restrooms.
A large amount of research has shown that paper towels provide greater hygiene than the electric hand dryers found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, sponsored by the Paper Towel Industry The European Tissue Symposium, which aimed to compare the level of hygiene provided by paper towels, hot-air hand dryers and state-of-the-art jet-air hand dryers.
After hand washing and drying with a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria increased on average 194% on finger pads and 254% on palms.
Drying with a jet-air dryer increased the total number of bacteria on average by 42% on the finger pads and 15% on the palms.
After washing hands and drying with paper towels, the total number of bacteria decreased on average by 76% on finger pads and up to 77% on palms. The scientists also conducted tests to establish whether each type of drying method resulted in cross-contamination potential of other toilet users and the toilet environment.
The jet-air dryer, which exhausted air from the unit at an estimated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was able to blow microorganisms from the hands and unit and potentially contaminate other toilet users and the environment of the toilet up to 2 meters away.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the micro - organisms to 0. 25 m from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various hand drying methods.
The following changes were observed in the bacterial count after drying the hands:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
One option is to wash hands using hand sanitizing wipes in the absence of soap and water during the journey.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should have at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory long after its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital environment was discovered by the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (in 1846).
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the use of these drugs has reduced the infection rate.
Medically, the hands are washed for a minimum of 15 seconds, with foam being created using a suitable amount of soap and water or gel and each part of the hands is rubbed.
Fingers of both hands should be rubbed together.
If there is debris under the nails, a hard hair brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in water on hands, it is important to wash well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used to close the water (and any exit doors should be opened if necessary).
It prevents the hands from contaminating those surfaces again.
Hand washing in health care is intended to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent them from being transmitted.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing continues at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands regularly before touching patients, leading to microbial transmission.
A study has shown that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by up to 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in health care settings.
The documented hand hygiene guidance provided by the organisation can also be found on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial appliances can measure and certify hand hygiene if it is necessary to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
The World Health Organization has set out "five opportunities" for washing hands:
After coming into contact with blood / body fluid
before the disinfectant, and
After patient care. Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soap) provides the hand washing agent with a killing effect.
Before performing surgery or in an environment where antibiotic resistance is widespread, such a lethal capacity may be desirable. To 'rub' your hands for surgical tears, it is necessary to have a tube that can be turned on and off without touching with the hands, some chlorohexidine or iodine wash, a disinfected towel to dry the hands after washing, and a disinfected brush for rubber cleaning and another disinfected tool for cleaning under the nails.
All jewellery should be removed.
The procedure normally requires washing the wrists up to the hands and elbows for 2 - 6 minutes.
No need to rub for a long time (10 minutes).
When washing, the wrists should prevent water from returning to the hands.
After completion of hand washing, hands are dried with a sterile cloth and a surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands before and after caring for a sick person or use hand sanitizer.
For the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene came from 20% before washing, and when the frequency of hand hygiene was increased by more than 35%, little additional benefit was obtained.
Hand washing with plain soap, compared with washing with antibacterial soap, leads to more than three times the rate of transmission of bacterial infectious disease. Comparing hand rubbing with alcohol-based solution with hand washing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 minutes, it was found that rubbing with alcohol reduces bacterial contamination of hands by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs for reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores on hands. Measures to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include educating employees on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and providing written and verbal reminders to employees.
More research is needed on which of these measures are most effective in different health care systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an affordable, essential means to achieve good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable water supply, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces is a challenge to achieve universal hand washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural Africa every private or public toilet has very few hand-washing faucets, even though cheap alternatives to build hand-washing stations exist.
However, low handwashing rates may be due to inadequate habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion and support of handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and bring about changes in long-term behaviour of the population.
For it to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based methods are effective at increasing hand washing in LMICs, while social outreach campaigns are less effective. An example of hand washing promotion in schools is the "three star method" by UNICEF that encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are achieved, the schools can go up to one to three stars respectively.
Building hand washing stations can be part of the hand washing promotion campaigns which are carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign aimed at trying to bring about a change in behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the prevention of DALYs.
However, a review shows that promoting hand washing with soap is significantly more cost effective than other water and sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for health - especially for people with sensitive conditions, such as mothers who have given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals - was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two promoters of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the Englishman who is "the founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people believed that infections were caused by a deodorant called miasmus.
In the 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-related infections prompted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a key way to prevent the spread of infection.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 raised awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "right handwashing techniques" were hung near handwashing sinks in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing one 's hands" from something means to declare one 's unwillingness to take responsibility for or to acknowledge complicity in that thing.
It comes from the biblical Matthew chapter where Pontius Pilate dissociated himself from the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it became a phrase with much wider use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clear a fictional stain that reveals her guilty conscience about the crimes she has committed and the motives that led her husband to commit the crimes.
It has also been found that after remembering or contemplating immoral acts, people wash their hands more often than others, and attach greater importance to hand washing equipment.
Furthermore, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleaning" counter-actions such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for both hygiene and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing with soapy water without hand washing is a part of ritual hand washing described in many religions, including the Baha'i religion, Hinduism, the Tevilah and Netilat Yadaim in Judaism, Lawabo in Christianity, and Wazu in Islam. Religions also recommend hand washing to provide hygiene, especially after certain actions.
Hand washing after using the toilet is obligatory in Hinduism, Judaism and Islam.
And, in Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, hand washing is mandatory before and after every meal.
Control of risks of spread of COVID-19 infection at workplace
The application of occupational safety and health procedures for hazard controls are to control the risks of spreading COVID-19 infection in the workplace, for the prevention of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of the risk of disease spread in the workplace depends on the workplace and the work being performed, which is based on risk assessment of sources of contact, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers who are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-contact risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with people and other coworkers for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including: hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, observing respiratory etiquette, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting the work environment.
Moderate contact risk jobs are those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 infection, but who may have been infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes staff who have contact with the general public such as schools, high-population-density work environments, and some high-volume sales arrangements.
In addition to basic infection prevention measures, risk control measures for this group include: contamination with high efficiency air filters, use of sneeze guards, and keeping personal protective equipment available for the situation if a COVID-19 infected person is encountered.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and mortuary personnel at high exposure risk if they come into contact with a person who is infected or suspected of having COVID-19, and this risk becomes an increased exposure risk if the personnel perform aerosol-producing procedures on, or collect or handle samples from, a person who is infected or suspected of having COVID-19.
Hazard controls suitable for these personnel include engineering controls such as negative pressure sensing chamber and personal protective equipment appropriate for the task.
There can be many impacts of COVID-19 outbreak within the workplace.
Personnel may be absent from work due to illness, the need to care for others or fear of possible contact.
The patterns of trade can change in relation to both what goods are in demand, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as at times of low demand or purchasing through delivery or roaming services).
Finally, movement of goods from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be affected. Preparedness and response plan for an infectious disease can be used to direct protective actions.
The plans address the levels of risk associated with various workplaces and job functions, including sources of risk, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and individual personnel risk factors such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address the risks and contingency plans for the circumstances that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
The goals of the response to an outbreak include: reducing transmission among employees, protecting people at high risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse impacts on other units in their supply chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located affects the responses that are taken.
The sequence of hazard controls is a structure widely used to group hazard controls according to their effectiveness in occupational safety and health.
Where COVID-19 threats cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control and finally personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work related hazards without depending on the behavior of the worker, and this may be the most cost - effective solution to implement.
Administrative control is changes in policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but it can help prevent some contacts.
All types of PPE should be selected based on the hazards to personnel, properly fitted (e. g. respirator), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained and changed as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low exposure risk have minimal occupational contact with people and other co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for workplaces include: frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory etiquette covering coughs and sneezes, providing tissue and trash containers, preparing teleportation or alternative shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using other people's tools and equipment, and regularly cleaning and disinfecting all work environments.
Early identification and isolation of potentially infectious persons in the workplace is an important step to protect the safety of personnel, customers, visitors and others.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they are free of fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-modifying medication, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, moderate contact risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of people who are not known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19, but may have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the workplace, or because the person has recently traveled internationally to a place with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes staff who have contact with the general public such as schools, high population-density work environments, and some high volume sales arrangements. This includes installing high efficiency air filters in engineering controls for this and high risk groups, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as transparent plastic sneeze guards, and installing drive-through windows for customer service. This includes encouraging sick staff in administrative controls for this and high risk groups to stay at home, replacing virtual contact with the public with face-to-face meetings, avoiding unnecessary travel to places with ongoing COVID-19 exposure, developing emergency communication plans, including: providing a platform for staff who may be concerned about the safety responses to COVID-19, providing staff with regular safety training on the latest risk and behavioral measures, including the use of personal protective equipment, hand-washing, hand-washing, hand-shaking, and hand hygiene, and providing training to employees who may be at risk, and other forms of workplace safety, including the use of personal protective equipment and hand washing devices, and providing training to employees who are at risk, and are, at risk from COVID-19.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of ventilators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect personnel and other passengers include: removing the sick person 6 feet from others, designating a crew member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a face mask or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with tissue if coughing or sneezing.
Crew should wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other consumables should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, hazard controls include postponing travel if sick and self-isolating and immediately notifying the on-board medical center if a person develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should be conducted in the quarantined person's room.For schools and infant care facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building free of community transmission.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, gatherings and other large gatherings such as physical education or singing classes or meals in restaurants, increasing the distance between desks, aligning arrival and holiday times, limiting unnecessary visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is sufficient transmission in the local community, extended school holidays may be considered in addition to social distancing strategies. For law enforcement personnel who do daily law enforcement activities, the immediate health risk is considered to be low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who have to contact confirmed or suspected persons with COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during catching, personnel should clean and disinfect their duty belts and equipment using household cleaning sprays or wipes before reusing, and follow standard operating procedures for disinfecting and disposing of used PPE and for disinfecting and washing clothes.
OSHA considers certain health care and mortuary personnel to be in the high or very high categories of exposure risk.
High contact risk jobs include health care providers, assistants, laboratory and medical transport personnel who come in contact with known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
These become very high exposure risk if personnel perform aerosol-producing procedures on known or suspected COVID-19 patients, collect or handle samples from them.
Procedures that generate aerosols include tubal penetration, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or sampling by incision.
High-risk contact mortuary tasks include those who prepare the bodies of individuals with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death; these become very high contact risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for known or suspected patients of COVID-19, including during aerosol-generating procedures.
Specific negative pressure transmissions may be appropriate in some health care and mortuary settings.
Samples should be handled with biosafety level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients, depending on whether they are a suspected COVID-19 case, be isolated in separate waiting areas.In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for individuals who work within 6 feet of known or suspected patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform aerosol-producing procedures.
In the US, NIOSH approved N95 filtered respirators or better must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory safety program that includes fit-testing, training and medical examination.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than being transmitted through bodily fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who are collecting, caring for or transporting respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, face shield, goggles and gloves.
If an aerosol generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to enter a room with a single COVID-19 patient, using only PPE required for the specific task, using the same respirator without removing it during the care of multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks for isolated individuals.

This month we are surrounded by extraordinary circumstances.
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the interconnectedness of all human beings in the world and our responsibilities towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented for us, but we must know that our best response depends on global empathy, mutual cooperation, and community building, which is at the heart of this organization.
The kind of friendliness we have seen among all our colleagues on email, call and chat is a remarkable testament to how much we are privileged to work with such extraordinary people.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as colleagues that I cannot express it in words.
Last week, someone shared with me his appreciation of our work.
It reminded me how meaningful it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia at this time, and how powerful it is to keep this most important resource online and available to everyone.
Your work makes it possible, whether you're keeping sites up or you're the source of pay for our coworkers or you're keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that comes from Wikipedia, and now more than ever.
It is a moment in which both our work and the way we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of this mission, and the importance of your role in it, we are going to make some remarkable changes in the way we work with you this coming week.
We had to change our work and schedules.
As Robin mentioned earlier, the C - team met last night to discuss our methodology and to set a timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered the appropriate response in our thinking to the situation we faced, and the best way to maintain the continuity of the organization during this time.
We were overwhelmed and we wanted to relieve the tension and give our mission long-term support.
If you have to reduce your work, there is nothing wrong with that.
For all staff, contractors and contract personnel:
Our daily work expectations will be approximately 4 hours per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you are able to work beyond normal hours, the mission needs your help.
However, the world is unpredictable these days, and whether you're caring for loved ones, shopping, or visiting the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We are not counting your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
We don 't have to say it, but we 're saying it.
No sick leave or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure that the main area of work is nobody - nobody.
(If you have been confirmed to have COVID-19, please inform Brian of T&C Ops so that T&C can assist you and ensure that your situation is appropriately addressed by management.)
Hourly employees will get full pay.
We have already said, and we are reaffirming our commitment to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
Everyone shall receive wages in accordance with his normal hours of work during normal conditions.
If you are sick and cannot work, you will still receive a salary.
If you want to work, we are with you.
Many people use their work as a way to escape the stresses of the world around them.
What we can do can be extremely satisfying, especially at such times.
Again, taking care of yourself is paramount.
Our suggestion is that you talk to your manager so that we know what to expect, and then we can make adjustments accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we can't let stop.
SRE, HR ops, trust and safety, and fundraising teams (and others) perform critical tasks that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and to focus our attention on supporting the things that are essential to our mission.
We all have so much to do, we will all just focus on the most necessary projects.
Slowing down now will save us from injury later.
There are no plans to double our recovery time once the pandemic is over.
You will no longer be required to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will work towards setting new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about APP?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we would like to reschedule the timeline for completing our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that gives us more time to budget, so that employees can prioritize their most important work, self-care, and care of loved ones, and those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule can be accommodated for the next few weeks.
This extension of the deadline will bring a significant reduction in our current planning workload and pressure throughout the organisation.
We will present our proposal to the board of directors next week and as soon as we have confirmation we will inform the delegates and teams about the next steps.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office location, contact, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, with great caution, we deployed antiviral cleaning personnel to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
He disinfected every surface, the lobby, and the elevator bank that led to our floor with a hospital-grade anti-viral solution.
The building is implementing its own duty of care protocol using products that assist the safety of its occupants.
We are confident that the office will be fully ready when we return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork that has shared its COVID-19 protocols with us and all DC-based staff members.
Last week our DC office had adopted a fully remote system in line with the guidance shared from San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, there is also talk of leasing a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working from home/remotely for the first time.
Our long-time remote workers know that this will require adjustments, and they want to give you some advice:
Limit the time of meetings to increments of one or two hours at most.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them over several days.
Define meetings clearly, have agendas ready, and send reading material in advance.
Make video your default with the help of tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and integration.
Take the initiative to facilitate the meeting, one person to monitor the chat for questions and keep track of each speaker list, and one person to help take notes (or collaboratively take notes)
If you need a comfortable headset, send an email to tech support.
Use the health reimbursement for your snack.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team is exploring webinar-based workflow guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as the Editathon, until the WHO declares the end of the global pandemic.
We told them that we understood that our cancellation requests and other restrictions might make it impossible to complete their mutually agreed-upon grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for being forced to delay or modify those goals.
In the coming weeks, we will follow up with additional guidance regarding Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The global community is saddened by this disruption, but also relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia, and otherwise.
Going forward, CRT is working to organize a page on Met-Wiki with the aim of providing a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow up our communications with them.
Keeping in touch about COVID-19 related issues
We will send an invitation to a special staff meeting in your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will use this time to provide additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We are together in this situation and are there to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from this email, and all other essential COVID-19 related information on the Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, programs, any major work streams, or coverage challenges, or you need help with anything else, please feel free to inform and work with the CRT.
We are there to provide support as needed and help build relationships.
If your case is confidential or sensitive, please send an email to Brian Judan, Director of Global Operations, HR International.
None of these changes should be seen as a renunciation of our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they recognize that at this time, our work and responsibilities may need to be adapted in ways that we have never done in the past.
We believe that these steps are necessary to help each other so that we can continue to work, deliver our activities with the support they need, and continue to deliver the service the world depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
Right now, it's time to help each other, and to make room for the important work that lies ahead in the weeks and possibly the months ahead.
We need each of you to make this happen, and that's why we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that you can be at your best when the need arises.
Now, please wash your hands and do not touch your face!
The following are the members of the leadership team: Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Brian J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Jenine U, Lisa S, Robin A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme associated with the outer surface of cells (cell membranes) in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 balances the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a promising drug target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 is a zinc - containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of the endothelium and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collector renal amino acid transporter domains.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein with unfolded enzymatically active domains on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is broken down by the transesterial domain by another enzyme called shades, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is mainly associated with the cell membrane of lung type II aerobic cells, enteric cells of the small intestine, endothelial cells of arteries and veins, and the soft tissue cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral vulva, the strata, the hypothalamus and the cerebral column.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a counter-charge to ACE.
ACE decomposes the angiotensin I hormone into the vascular constrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 then decomposes the carboxyl - terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - Phe) and hydrolyzes it to the vascular dilator angiotensin (1-7), (H - Asp - Arg - Val - Tyr - Ile - His - Pro - OH).
ACE2 [des-Arg9] - can also degrade a number of other peptides, including bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and its role has been reported in Hartnap disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the cell surface leads to the transfer of both the virus and the enzyme in the endosomes located within the cells during endocytosis and cell death.
This entry process also requires the activation of the S protein by the nutrient serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently under investigation as a potential therapy. Because of this, some have hypothesized that lowering the level of ACE2 in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional bodies and regulatory bodies have recommended the continuation of standard ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia of 34% compared to controls".
Also, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially in people with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a novel therapy for acute lung damage, and appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes with a course (duration) of action of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people with intolerance to excellent renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated. distilled rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications created to assist in contact tracing, i.e. the process of identifying persons ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person, in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic.
In some regions and jurisdictions, a number of applications were developed or proposed with official government support.
Several frameworks have been developed for the construction of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the geographical location of app users.
A less intrusive option, involves using Bluetooth signals to log the proximity of a user's other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they will integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government has employed an app in conjunction with Alipay China, allowing citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is being used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The app was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched a Bluetooth-based app "StopKorona!" to track contacts with potentially infected individuals and provide quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said that the contact tracing app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for deployment within weeks. Similar apps ("StopCovid") have also been deployed in Ireland and France.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering Singapore's TraceTogether app and apps based on the BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a geofencing app for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and potential lack of effectiveness if app use is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
Addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store to only "official" or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners have expressed their concerns about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be destroyed once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on such surveillance.
The organisations have declared eight conditions on government projects:
surveillance must be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
There should be a clause for the extension of supervision and surveillance;
Use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
Data security and anonymity should be protected and represented as protected on the basis of evidence;
Digital surveillance should avoid promoting discrimination and disempowerment;
Any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
There should be measures to protect the rights of citizens to respond to and respond to abuse;
"Sensible participation" by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and disadvantaged groups, will be required.The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter von Grunegen) (RSF) have also released checklists.
The proposed Google/Apple scheme aims to solve the problem of constant surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their device operating system when it is not needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to unrefined location data have significant potential privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with a central server require access to personal location data; many privacy - protecting systems have been created that use a central server only for intercommunication (see section below).
A non-app-based system was used to trace contacts in South Korea.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined these to generate notifications to potentially infected individuals via text messages.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has made location information publicly available due to far-reaching changes in information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
The information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Many countries, including Germany, have considered using centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As on 6th April 2020, these details were not released yet.
Privacy-protecting contact tracing is a well-established concept with a large body of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to log proximity to a user's other cellphones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes both centralized and decentralized methods, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy-preserving proximity tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact number (TCN, formerly contact event number, CEN), privacy sensitive protocol and mechanism for mobile contact tracing (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all happens on the matched device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data for tracking the spread of COVID-19.
It builds on research from the white paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Epidemic" released in March 2020. A similar effort is SafeTrace by Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technology originally set up at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies, allowing users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5th April 2020, the global TCN alliance was established by groups that had essentially come together in the context of the same approach and largely the same protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, which was a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it has open-sourced the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracing, which they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of Bluetooth low energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
He also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be made available in three phases:
Tools to enable governments to create privacy-preserving coronavirus tracing apps
Integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android
Drug re-approval (also known as drug re-purposing, re-profiling, re-assignment or therapeutic change) is the re-purposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a disease or medical condition other than the one for which it was originally developed.
It is a system of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include plasma transplants related to the development and health benefit of a COVID-19 vaccine.SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 target proteins, each of which has several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of those binding sites provides a reasonable projection of developing an effective antiviral drug for protection against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins include papen-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicases, S proteins and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussain et al. studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized and analyzed for similarity of their formulations with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of an effective SARS-CoV-2 antibody in a preclinical study recommended in a clinical study structure.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used for protection against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four medicines to be studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquyl phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA' s clinical trials process and it is authorized only under EUA as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but are unable to receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC has stated that "the use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors have said they are using the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of prophylactic use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir to be "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative for an average of 4 days, while the duration of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study of 240 patients with pneumonia in Wuhan, half of the patients received favipiravir and half received omifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the current evidence in support of the drug is very small and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug would be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has sent a proposal to the Trump administration about buying the drug, which may be less effective in severe cases of illness where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or women trying to conceive.
A study of the antiviral lopinavir and a combination of ritonavir, lopinavir/ ritonavir (calatra), concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to block HIV from replicating by binding to proteases.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There has been criticism within the scientific community about directing resources towards the re-purposing of drugs being developed, especially for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was manufactured and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had artificial peripheral antiviral activity for protection against several filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and corona-viruses.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can cause more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that there may be a high genetic barrier to resistance to remdesivir. Several clinical trials are underway, including two trials run by the University of Cleveland Hospital; one for people with moderate illness and another for people with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and critically ill people with COVID-19; two placebo controlled (in China, Canada) and one without any control (in Italy).
New York state began trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial for a corticosteroid, Tygens Elvesco (siclesodaine), for asthma, for the treatment of patients with pre-symptomatic infection with the novel coronavirus.
A phase II trial of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is underway in Denmark, Germany and Austria with 200 patients recovering from severe, hospitalized cases to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients suffering from mild COVID-19.
The study, named COLCORONA, is enrolling 6000 adults aged 40 years and above who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and who are experiencing mild symptoms, which do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who are not using an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several screening agents are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used to treat patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centre study of 300 patients investigating the use of anoxaparin sodium at prophylactic and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, much scientific attention has been focused on the repurposing of approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the guidelines of the Chinese 7th edition
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potential reusable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tosylzumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved by China.
Trials also in Italy and China. See also Tocilizumab #COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine for protection against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, several efforts are being made to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine to protect against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak occurred worldwide in 2020, leading to significant investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop potential vaccines for protection against SARS-CoV-2.
The imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development, as outlined in April, are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale planning and global acquisition.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine to protect against COVID-19.
Key platform objectives advanced in Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 have been confirmed as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others are announced, but less public information is available (are being designed or conceived in planning).
A phase I - II trial involves preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, usually performed at random, placebo - controlled and multiple sites, determining a more accurate, effective dose.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, with a control group monitoring for adverse effects at the optimal dose, and testing the vaccine's effectiveness for preventing disease.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine, which would genetically modify viral proteins to induce an immune response.
In Canada around 24 January 2020, the International Vaccine Centre at the University of Saskatchewan (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it had started working on a vaccine, with the goal of starting human trials in 2021.
The vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January 2020.
Around 29 January 2020, the Janzen Pharmaceutical Company, led by Hynek Schütemecker, announced that it had started work on developing a vaccine.
Yansen is developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with VacSart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, Oncogene, a laboratory in Romania, published a paper on the design of a vaccine similar to the technique used for neoantigen vaccination therapy of cancer.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that they had finalized the synthesis of the vaccine and were starting trials.
On 27 February 2020, NuGenrex Immuno-Oncology, a subsidiary of Genrex, announced that they are launching a vaccine project to create a ly-key peptide vaccine for protection against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, Western Maryland both announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it was in development and manufacturing of the vaccine
will work with Novavax Inc.
The partners announced plans for preclinical trials and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 vendors, and that it will take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine even on a fast track.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human trials planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had offered Curevac "large sums of money for special access to the COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government objected to.
On 17 March 2020, US drug company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
The mRNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently in pre-clinical trials, with clinical trials expected to commence in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, an Italian biotech company Tacis Biotech announced that they would have preclinical trial results in April 2020 and could begin trials on their final vaccine candidate by the fall.
On 19 March 2020 in France, The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in the COVID-19 vaccine research consortium, which includes Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which brings CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for the development of COVID-19 vaccines are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had started animal trials of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-enhanced RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical measures for protection from COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates from Canadian companies and universities, such as MediCago and the University of Saskatchewan.
Around the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million to develop a COVID-19 vaccine specifically, along with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other coronavirus outbreaks occurred.
On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the testing of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA-provided SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines have induced antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that were evident to begin 2 weeks after vaccination".
On 16 April 2020 in Canada, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be engineered to replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies for protection against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources to acquire supercomputers from IBM, in combination with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have adverse effects, also known as non specific effects.
This means that they may have benefits in addition to the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia is asking for 4,170 healthcare workers to be recruited.
It is possible that the vaccines in development will not be safe or effective.
Preliminary research assessing the efficacy of vaccines using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures to deal with the live virus and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines have been tested for protection against SARS and MERS in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or protective vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no certified vaccine for protection against MERS.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful blueprint for developing vaccines and treatments for protection against a MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA based) MERS vaccine that completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are in progress, of which all are viral-vectored vaccines, two are adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one is MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy, claiming that the virus responsible for COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of the sense of smell and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms is normally about five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases have mild symptoms, a few cases develop viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during close contact, often through small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these droplets are generated when breathing out, they generally fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a dirty surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most infectious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.The standard method of diagnosis is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others making their use mandatory.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be allergic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty in breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty in waking, and facial or lip blueness; immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in different percentages.
In some cases in China, initially only chest tightness and rapid heartbeat was observed.
In some cases, the disease can progress to pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the budding period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally five to six days, but it can be up to two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms develop symptoms within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people develop symptoms.
The role of these immunocompromised carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood; however, initial evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not exhibit symptoms is currently unknown and being studied, with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in hospital.
China's National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both mucus and saliva can contain large amounts of viral material.
Speaking in a high voice produces more droplets than speaking in a normal voice.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered coughs can produce droplets up to 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has reported that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and samples from air collectors installed in corridors outside people's rooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as vascular penetration and cardiopulmonary therapy (CPR) can cause aerosols to form from respiratory secretions and thus airborne spread.
Although there are concerns that it may spread through feces, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic; although transmission is possible before symptoms develop, this risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person typically infects two to three other people.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable on cardboard for one day, on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) for three days, and on 99% copper for four hours.
Even then, it varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and scrubbers are also effective if used correctly; soap products inactivate viruses by breaking down their protective layer of fat, and also free them from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a cluster of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks down its protective envelope.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 as the virus reaches nutrient cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II air cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "contact" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac damage was found in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in severe illness.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high due to the physiological inflammatory response and disorders of the immune system during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections, which may be related to poor diagnosis.Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 have found radiocarbon-induced airway damage (DAD) and lymphocyte-induced inflammatory externalities within the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a sequence for ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflation.
Specifically, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to be correlated with selection of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic external substances have also been reported in autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT - PCR).
This test is usually done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasal passage; however, a nasal passage or mucous sample may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these require two blood samples to be taken two weeks apart and the results have less immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infection and whether a person has been infected before) were in development but have not yet been widely used.
Chinese experience with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
In the US, the FDA approved the first-care-of-the-spot test for use later that month on 21 March 2020.The diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University outlined ways to detect infection based on clinical features and pandemic risk.
Bilateral polyploid ground-glass opacities with a peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infections.
As the disease progresses, subplural dominance, crazi paving (thickening of the walls paved with variable air cell fillers), and thickening may appear.
There are few data available on the micro-infections and morbidity of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings from the autopsy are:
Microscopy: Inflammation of the pulmonary membrane, pericarditis, thickening of the lungs and pulmonary edema
There are four types of viral pneumonia severity:
Mild pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocytes overgrowth, large irregular pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic interstitial and polycentric giant cell formation
Severe pneumonia: radial airway leakage with radial airway damage (DAD).
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Treating pneumonia: management of leaks in the air cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: circulating interstitial scan (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently and for at least 20 seconds with soap and water, maintaining good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow if tissue is not available.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings to limit transmission by partially asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The distancing guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no drug known to be effective for preventing COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until at least 2021, an important part of managing COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the pandemic, called "curving the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear dirty, before eating, and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
Additionally, it recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. In areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial action is generated from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active substance for hand contraception".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
The is managed with supportive care, which may include providing fluid therapy, oxygen support and other vital organs to those affected.
The CDC recommends that people who are suspected of being infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful in people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for caring for people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intesiologists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical personnel recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for primary use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings when aerosol-generating procedures such as tubal penetration or hand infusion are performed.
For healthcare workers caring for individuals infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be kept in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and airborne precautions.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an epidemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection equipment, and medical gloves. When available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings, but the FDA has authorized masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for unapproved experiments.
If masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a small percentage of cases do.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied for hospitalized individuals, with some evidence that duct penetration with high flow nasal inlet or dual-level positive airway pressure can be avoided.
Whether either of these offers the same benefit to critically ill people is not known.
Some practitioners prefer to use penetrating mechanical ventilation when available as this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high flow nasal ventilation. Severe cases are most common in older adults (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the ability of a health system to handle a sudden increase in the number of severe enough COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required mechanical assistance for transition, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 have eventually been admitted to the ICU.
Mechanical convection becomes more complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygen provision becomes progressively more difficult.
Pressure control systems and ventilators capable of high PEEP are required to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing ventilator-associated lung damage and risk of pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may be developed by 2021, many of the drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are already in advanced trials.
Antiviral medication may be attempted in people with severe disease.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has temporarily authorized health-promoting plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where there is a serious or immediate threat to the life of the person.
It has not had the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect potential risk of infection by tracking 'close contacts' using surveillance data.
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If potential risks are detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but it also alerts local health authorities. Cellphone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and big data analytics for artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those they contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
This measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those coming in contact with infected citizens.
Furthermore, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared joint phone location data with the Robert Koch Institute, a German federal government agency for preventing and researching the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violators.
Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gellera said he had been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are moving in some way".
The German government organized a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kerstis Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "Increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and an economic downturn are a perfect storm that is harming people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may have a mild course with or without some of the symptoms of other common upper respiratory tract diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while cases with severe or acute illnesses may take three to six weeks to recover.
Based on statistics from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19, but there are fewer statistics for COVID-19.In some people, COVID-19 can cause pneumonia by affecting the lungs.
In the most severely affected people, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), leading to respiratory failure, appendicitis or multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include constipation, abnormal scaling and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Scanning abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of people hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function is seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people infected with COVID-19 exhibit an increase in liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same information, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the average time from displaying early symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, the mortality rate among men was 2.8% while the mortality rate among women was 1.7%.
Tissue pathology examinations of lung samples from autopsy show radial aortic damage with cellular fibromycoid leaks in both lungs.
Viral cell pathological changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung picture appeared to be similar to that of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage was noted by high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to the US March data, 89% of people admitted to hospital had pre-existing conditions. Availability of medical resources and socio-economic status of an area can also affect the mortality rate.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to those regional differences and also due to system related difficulties.
Low count of mild cases may result in higher estimate of mortality.
However, the fact that the death is the result of cases that occurred in the past may mean that the current mortality rate has been underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and were almost 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20% to 30% decline in lung capacity in some people recovering from the disease, and lung scans revealed organ damage.
It can also cause post - recovery intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people who have recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as potential based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases of positive testing for coronavirus have been reported in the date after recovery from COVID-19.
These cases are considered to be worse than a previously uncured infection rather than a re - infection.
The virus is considered to be of a viral origin, spreading naturally and through infection from animal to human.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely through human-to-human transmission.
In a study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The earliest onset of symptoms was reported by WHO official publications as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to determine mortality.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, quality of health care system, treatment options, time elapsed from initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and the disease code U07.2 for deaths from clinically or pandemically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global case-to-case ratio as of 17 April 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the case mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection mortality rate (IFR) which represents the percentage of infected individuals who die from a disease (diagnosed and undiagnosed).
These statistics are not time bound and follow a specific population from infection to recovery.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castellione d'Aida, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnival festivals and among young people, resulting in relatively low mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally classified.
Moreover, the German health system is not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population can be immunized, according to the evaluation of blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) deaths from COVID-19 have been confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality varies for men and women.
In studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher among men.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is narrowed only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact causes of this gender gap are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a factor.
Gender-based immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking in women and developing co-morbid conditions in men such as high blood pressure at younger ages than women may contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government is not tracking gender-related statistics of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease will be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that CO stands for Corona, VI stands for Virus, D stands for Disease, and 19 stands for the year when the outbreak was first identified i.e. 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (such as China), species of animals or group of people, which are consistent with international recommendations for nomenclature aimed at preventing mispronunciation.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO additionally uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease of acute respiratory illness, which complies with 2015 guidelines not to use spaces in disease and virus names.
The formal names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare materials such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed ventilator valves, and the supplier was unable to provide them in the required timeframe, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracies, misinformation and misleading information about the origin, stage, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly online.
Humans seem to be able to spread viruses to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drug or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "Solidarity Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
No vaccine is currently available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being explored.
First, the researchers aim to create a complete virus vaccine.
The goal of using such viruses, whether inactivated or dead, is to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that makes the immune system susceptible to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-contact protein that helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for making vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies will have to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent growth has been reported as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active APR clinical trials are being conducted by 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
With nine Phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries due to be reported by the end of April, most of the Chinese research is being done on reusable antiviral drugs.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates was underway. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta and lopinavir/ritonavir.
As of March 2020, experimental evidence is available for the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was seen in patients treated with the non-approved use of Remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, already used for the treatment of malaria, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
However, there have been calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, noting that twice that dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of clinicians treating people with COVID-19.The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use for protection against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required for the suppression of artificial peripheral SARS-CoV-2.
Nitatoxanide has been recommended for further study in organisms after demonstrating low concentration suppression of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that early contact protein priming by the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is required for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACE2 receptor.
There are major limitations of studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further study.Osaltamir does not inhibit synthetic peripheral SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Increased cytokine levels may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine properties. Tokilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a small study was completed.
It is undergoing a nationwide phase 2 non-randomized trial in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
In combination with serum ferritin blood testing to identify increases in cytokine levels, it aims to counteract such increases, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
Leucine-6 receptor antagonists were approved by the FDA in 2017, based on retrospective case studies, for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by CAR T cell therapy, a different cause.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated immunosubstances produced by the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 to those who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy was used for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral desensitization is the anticipated mechanism by which inactivated antibody therapy may mediate protection from SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/ or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example using artificial monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of health benefit serums, which contain the liquid portion of the blood of the recovered patients and have specific immunity to this virus, can be increased for rapid scheduling.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a physician at the Central Hospital in Wuhan, who contracted COVID-19 and died after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
