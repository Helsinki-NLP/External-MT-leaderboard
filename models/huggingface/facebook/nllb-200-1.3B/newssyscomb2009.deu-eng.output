The right-wing populists in Austria are winning, 29% of the vote
A noticeable weakening of both parties in the previous grand coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties led to early parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday, according to the first preliminary results.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, with the position of its former chairman, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously threatened.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Carinthia's Landshauptmann Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the performance of the ÖVP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote at 25.6 percent.
This is the worst result for the two major parties in the post-war history of Austria, and especially for the People's Party, which had demanded early elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
In July, when the ÖVP withdrew from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear lead over the SPÖ.
But voters probably punished the party for failing the government.
The first reactions to the results were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case at an extraordinary meeting of the party's board on Monday.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. a renewal of the grand coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
The Social Democrats, however, expressed their fear that the same situation could be repeated in 1999 when the People's Party reached agreements with the Populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, but in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) on a joint government, which had even prompted sanctions from the European Union.
This is obviously the case with Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he expects a return to Vienna in Austrian federal politics.
The Greens also entered the Parliament, but suffered minor losses and fell from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have won the four per cent threshold and therefore not entered parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool off
The Czech Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg, believes that if the problem of the Czech scientists accused of illegal beetle collection in India is not solved, there could be a certain cooling of relations between the Czech Republic and India.
This was emphasised by the Minister in New York after his meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not cleared up, then, of course, there will be some cooling", he said after a meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government wanted to settle with the local government in Dardjiling, whose case law the matter falls under.
"His problem could be solved", said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdi felt it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could then apply for bail and be free to await his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had made the same statement during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then he could be pardoned", said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convict with "competent legal assistance", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such help was already being offered by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India which have a long-standing tradition.
The Indians also admit that", Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he reiterated to his partner, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it is a big mistake to arrest and prosecute these Czech scientists", he explained.
When asked whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister avoided answering.
"I've been promised a lot", he said.
A Czech judge over the fight for the seabed
He approaches an electronic map of Australia and the surrounding marine areas.
But he's not interested in the continent, but in a tiny dot lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island is part of Australia, and with it the surrounding seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself", says Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Law of the Sea.
His boss, the division director, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and occasionally adds to it.
It's a place of work and enthusiasm.
The ocean floor is a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is a place where oil, ores and other non-renewable raw materials can be found, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea floor larger than the mainland
The coastal States today declared their claim to the new maritime territories.
They are exercising their rights under a UN convention agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is especially the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of a country into the sea.
The Convention gives this country exclusive rights to all the sources of the continental shelf.
"In simple terms, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its soles which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It goes beyond the shoreline, often beyond the 200 nautical mile limit of the so-called exclusive economic zone", explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the determination of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by a large scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation.
"One of our tasks is to provide the Commission with legal and technical support.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful", adds Mikulka.
The success of Australia, which became the first country to significantly increase its maritime area, has recently been an international success.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed granted to the country by the Commission last week is about 1.6 million square kilometres, about six times the size of the country itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The future benefits they will derive from the use of the seabed will be invaluable, they promise.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
They can do this for 10 years from the moment they ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which the Convention calls "the common heritage of mankind".
No state will have a special position here.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold-digging country", says Director Mikulka, exaggerating, adding that "the individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other former Eastern Bloc states within the framework of the joint organisation 'Interoceanmetal'.
In 1991, the Bank, like the investors of a few other States, was granted the status of a 'pioneering investor' under the Convention.
The organisation has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it's a kind of Tatra on the seabed.
"You can drill there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", says another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings such a concrete as a sample.
It reminds one of a small potato or, with a little imagination, of the fabled schem that the legend of the golem brought to life.
German special forces were on the scene when the hostages were released.
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they didn't go in.
More and more details are being revealed about the release of 11 European tourists who were abducted in Egypt.
German special forces were also involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior.
According to the German Federal Police, the German Federal Criminal Police, the Federal Criminal Investigation Service, the Federal Air Force, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Aviation and the Federal Aviation Agency and the Federal Aviation Agency, and the Federal Aviation Agency and the Federal Aviation Agency, and the Federal Aviation Agency and the Federal Government, and the Federal Government and the Federal Government of the Federal Government of the Federal Government of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United States of the United
However, as ministry spokesmen said on Monday evening, German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and fled when they saw signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve them as support forces on the ground.
"Fortunately, this did not happen", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian companions were abducted by attackers in southern Egypt on September 19.
After being abducted in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were transported back and forth across the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers remained unclear until recently, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages are in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to Bild newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces will be flown out on an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
US House of Representatives rejects bailout package
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly defeated the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 votes to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's bailout for the financial markets.
Despite appeals from US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the programme to curb the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, the proponents had tried desperately to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called for the agreement of the members of the House, even though the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political approval for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet", he admitted.
During the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason was investors' concern that the state bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, only to fall back down again after the failure was announced.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence on the international financial markets.
The Commission has also proposed a number of amendments to the Commission's proposal.
Organisers see rising bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months have increased significantly compared with the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic prospects, a study shows that the German travel appetite remains unabated.
The German Travel Association (DRV) reported on Monday in Berlin that the winter season bookings of the rice offices increased by 31 percent compared with the same period last year.
The market research institute GfK's study also shows an increase in bookings for the autumn months.
The increase in turnover of travel agencies in October was around 11 per cent compared with 2007, the DRV reported.
The results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates the total market.
The travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008 were included.
The DRV reported that the weak dollar rate was particularly demanding for travel to the USA.
The increase in bookings here is about one third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the home countryside, are particularly popular destinations for Germans.
Package travel in particular was in high demand, said Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "better calculated for the customer than for an individually organised holiday".
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be able to adopt a decision on the application of the rules on the free movement of goods.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that sales will increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jugs and celebrities in designer dirndl.
It's a Wiesn debut.
Susanne Crown Sugar and I don't really have much in common.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she wears a custom-made dress.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is second-hand.
But one thing unites us: in less than three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers are already rushing at us and pinching the memory cards full - very flatteringly, and that on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to be serving its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri, actually north of the White House equator, the feeling of well-being in the country was still limited.
But once you get to Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or is embarrassed to touch - all is perfectly normal.
Strange looks at the chocolate banana stand only gets my dick in the ass.
A woman from Munich pointed out that I had tied the apron wrong: "Left hoist free, middle virgin, right forgiven, back widowed".
I'm secretly looping from back to left.
"Fit", he said, laughing.
Others, by reducing their efforts in subtle flirting techniques, wear simple silk hats with the words "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch their naked buttocks toward an uninvited person.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, he's from England and he's also attending the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", with a long "ooooo".
He tells me that after he's got rid of his previous drinking.
Right next to one of those fire hydrants that everyone thinks is a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those notorious "wildbies".
Others are not so fortunate as to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics are running in droves across the square to care for the poor swallowers.
The nurses are always in the pack - four at a time, hauling a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
It's like most Wiesn visitors, empty out, full back.
You can't see who's in the Promille tank under the plane.
"These are the ones we're going to catch", one of the paramedics called me on demand and disappeared into the mess.
Name of the victim of the accident released by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been released.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving following the crash.
He's been released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were keen to penetrate deep into Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 paces inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
Hydarpasha Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the guides tell you.
The building sits at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front, making it look like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you're inside the arched ticket counter, there's no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Company.
Germany, being a latecomer in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond to what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany's imperialist plans were crippled during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, created by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces were moving out of Egypt and pushing the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there was also bad news for the Hyderabad Railway Station.
In 1917, a train of munitions blew up the elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into disrepair, largely forgotten by history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything to the east of it, to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizon.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a radically new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
We are now in a state of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the key elements of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on the tracks that produced the old world pace in the famous documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as the new city for the new secular state project of turning its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, which is known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main office of the AKP, a purpose-built, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle-level managers in suits, both men and women, met to close the first trades of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception", he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look both east and west at the same time.
There's no one or the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could be forced to make a choice at some point", I asked.
"Turkey", he said, "did not want to face this decision".
He then made a point which almost everyone I spoke to here has said almost routinely: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea region, are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, Europe as a whole can, figuratively speaking, travel eastward on the same railways towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasa station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German gentlemen, Mr Knight and Mr Conu, who had watched this building being built 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now be largely in the hands of Turkey.
And as I waited at the docks for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At least at the time, there seemed little doubt as to which continent should claim this fascinating land.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (calling on September 11th) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his musical program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for youths under 21, but when the choir sang its last song in 1979, some of us were already in our late 20's - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to take on any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and was due solely to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for music, which never waned over the years.
How often has death stopped us from "let the music speak for itself".
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants".
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His style of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never bossy but never exaggerated.
No matter how high the musical level, he always demanded a higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years or so, I've written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that I've never been disappointed by a single one - often I've been inspired by them.
Tod Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He despised conductors who, he said, simply "walked around with one or two of the world's leading show horses".
So many of us will miss him.
The Commission shall be assisted by the European Parliament.
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25 September) you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and was awarded a Houblon-Norman research fellowship in 1950 ... while studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD at the same time.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He was in the United States in 1950-51 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for good and went to Illinois.
It's not clear why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life', because his black and white documentary photographs are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they exude, the way they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments.
Second round of the great sale at Honda.
In November, Honda will begin marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor had a large interior, this large-scale limousine offers a much larger interior.
Added to this are the technical refinements that make driving even more comfortable and fuel-saving.
Changes before the coming revolution.
So is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz has a similar lineage to its predecessor, the changes made to this large saloon are numerous.
Among other things, the emphasis will be on the innovative design, the new flexibility of space, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched.
The first observations suggest that Honda was able to renew this model in a shorter period of time than other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of sales in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, a country where the Jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and again in the course of this year 2008.
After the jazz was introduced, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 Jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are 10 000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As regards the new generation of the model, the heads of the branches in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
More specifically, the introduction of the new Honda Jazz model allows the decline in sales in Spain to be covered.
In fact, the brand's managers hope to end the year with a total of 22 000 cars sold, 4 000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% target in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is betting on the appearance of a new model.
The Japanese company hopes to sell around 200 000 models a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese manufacturer's market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The market launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, with the first public presentation in January in Valencia.
As for the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus 5 centimetres), its width is 1.69 metres (plus 2 centimetres) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 metres, which suggests that it has grown by 5 centimetres.
The height, on the other hand, remains the same, standing at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also being enlarged.
This success is due to the new space flexibility programme and the central position of the fuel tank, a solution which was also used in the previous Jazz model.
The capacity of the trunk, which is provided by a double-deck system, is also up to 339 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be stressed that these measures are in place for the 1.4-litre petrol engine version, as the capacity of the boot of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, apart from the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of panoramic windows, improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, whereas the first jazz had only 67 degrees.
The second generation of Jazz's engines are also new.
At the beginning of its commercialisation, this small model had two versions of petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have an i-VTEC system, which allows for low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, excellent technical performance and, at the same time, high torque performance throughout the engine life.
The first variant, with 1.2 litres, produces 90 hp at 6 000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 rpm.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 litres of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
The engine, which had 83 hp in the previous generation, is now capable of reaching 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has a 5.4 litre fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
` Car bee', which avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan took inspiration from nature, more precisely from bees.
A Japanese company has developed a robot that mimics the flying behavior of swarms of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But most importantly, the bee's multifaceted eyes, which can see in all directions at an angle of 300 degrees, allow it to fly undisturbed in its own personal airspace without interruption.
To recreate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed what is called a laser range finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two metres away from the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor which is immediately translated into a collision avoidance signal
` The moment an obstacle is detected, the little robot will mimic the flight of the bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90° or even higher to avoid the collision.
The main difference from any other system is that this evasive maneuver is absolutely instinctive.
If it were not, the robot might not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,' explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the lead engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot move up or down, nor can it move across; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels, and not in the infinite directions and infinite ways that bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the little robot can avoid collisions.
` This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act on it.
It does not require storing either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers performed, so it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it's not about the GBs, and it's not even about the MBs of storage.
This is the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies, a technology that Nissan predicts will be introduced in production cars within the next decade.
The robot operates on lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She's trembling before she's charged with a mortgage.
You have to realize that the US Treasury, apart from having the liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and to avoid involving US citizens in the mortgage stories of supposedly solvent banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe the hotel of bad credit or the other.
The third aspect of this accommodation, and especially its receptionist, is to think once, twice, and even three times about whether it's time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the point of the game.
She's got useful information, but no details.
This is more of a teenage page than a place for all the audience.
What happens when the game expands?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least some, because it's not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley provides capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, making it the first bank in Japan to issue $9 billion and thus acquire 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a sharp fall in its stock market price.
One week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks announced that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a single price of $25.25, for a total of $3 billion.
The price assumed is below 19% of the share price at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will provide it with a 10% return and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global deal will be done on the basis of a uniform average price of $29 which is 28% above the current market value.
Morgan Stanley shares, however, fell by 6.79% to $23.07 at 5pm GMT.
`This strategic link represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to holding bank status,' said John Mack, Managing Director of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which should allow it to expand its business into new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Your connection to MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The terms of the deal also show that the deal has changed over the past few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
`A week ago', Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, `We thought that the holding would be entirely of ordinary shares.
But in view of the current economic and market situation we wanted to reduce the risks and to protect ourselves.'
On the basis of a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below the market value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will be able to recover with a reduction in earnings of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year, if the latter are exchanged within a given time limit at more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. at approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to exploit investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
A spokesman for the group, however, declined to give any details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the investment by MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to achieve a solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that it had reduced its balance sheet considerably since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has seen its stock market price fall by half as the price of insolvency insurance has skyrocketed.
This price decreased on Monday but remained at a high level, at around 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other survivor of the big investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had withdrawn $15 billion, part of it from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The European Union is a democratic country.
This is the joint project of Hugo Chávez, a Venezuelan, Evo Morales, a Bolivian and Rafael Correa, an Ecuadorian.
It was the third who, following the example of his fellow-men and friends, voted for the draft of a new constitution on Sunday.
The Commission has fulfilled its mission, because according to the public results, which amount to 80% of the votes cast, 64% voted 'Yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
For the draft constitution to be adopted, one vote must be obtained for more than half of the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls at the exit of polling stations and a count by an NGO had predicted a clear victory for the Yes, with 63% to 70% predicting it.
In the night from Sunday to Monday, by the way, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his draft constitution.
The Constitution has triumphed in a stunning way', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometres south-west of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in secret under the auspices of the Organization of American States (OAS), was on a 444-point text on securing the 'new socialism' for which the President is campaigning.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by giving it the exclusive right to 'development planning' in a country which largely lives on oil extraction by foreign companies and on foreign exchange sent by emigrants.
The project, which is being promoted by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants the head of state more power, which will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the possibility to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free health care and education, which the President has already begun to implement in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-narcotics operations.
The 19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched an attack on the kidnappers of the 11 tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days earlier.
They're in Cairo.
The 11 European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions who had been held captive in the desert for 11 days were returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon, unharmed and unharmed.
The next morning they were liberated by an Egyptian command in Chad.
The hostages, apparently in good condition, arrived at the al-Maza military base near Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being allowed to speak to the press, by helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, a foreign-born neighborhood of Cairo, for examination.
They are all in good health and no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers,' said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna at the scene.
After being captured on September 19 while on an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat on the border between Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages were repeatedly moved from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
The tourists are 11 - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptus agency, the organiser of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
'Shots were fired on both sides and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said the official, who wished to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomatic corps, Franco Frattini, was reporting from Belgrade, where he is currently, on the role played by Italian secret agents and special forces.
'We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces men,' he said, without elaborating.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The Sudanese army had claimed the previous evening to have stopped a patrol vehicle carrying the kidnappers, killing six of them, including the leader from Chad, and arresting two.
The army stated that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which was immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
That's all the better.
But one area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums given to the small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historic sites that are starving to death?
What politician will dare to remind the Federal Government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no proper laws to effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros exclusively for the restoration of the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have a constitution that says that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of Congress and all districts of government, by mutual consent.
In Quebec, the Association of Historical Societies of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, are working hard to get deeply involved in history, to save the many private archives with a few pennies, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when funders and policymakers unleash their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
The Benelux countries are trying to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has been in turmoil since the US financial crisis, by partially nationalising it. The three countries are providing a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held a high-level meeting over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission's Competition Authority.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions now being taken in relation to the bank could be precedent-setting.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states are buying their respective shares of the bank, which amount to about 49%.
The Bank is likely to sell part of its holdings, in particular the insurance business acquired by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares started a steep decline last week, with serious crisis scenarios already emerging in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too large to fail.
The institute's stock fell 12% on Friday to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the group is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
Management believes that the $700 billion American bailout and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are responsible for the downward trend in Fortis's stock.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new CEO of the Bank.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party with a factual offer was found.
The Belgian government, however, tried to reassure investors that they should not be afraid of their money.
The customers have not panicked, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the henhouse
Because of a person's drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are privacy policies that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in an independent hand, otherwise we'll leave the chickens to the fox", says Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription data tracking program.
Insurance companies set the costs and the amount of the damage depending on the health of the customer and if the risk is overestimated, the insurance is not taken out at all.
In the past, the customer was sent for a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a far cheaper method: using the customer's identification number, he obtained the data from the pharmacies for the last year and a half, that is, which drugs were purchased, and the program calculates from this the disease of the customer and his state of health.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering medication, it would suggest that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically put him at a higher risk.
There are several versions of the programme in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that insurance companies have to deal with more paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as for migraines and hot flashes, but also for depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the insurers' point of view, whereas the previous ones are not.
For the collection and processing of data, companies have been formed which ask for the consent of the patient before they obtain the data.
In the meantime, they are required to do so by law, although omissions have not been punished.
Some companies even process lab results and combine them with data on drug use to provide an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and at the same time it is becoming more difficult to control its use.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to healthcare and insurance providers.
The bill has already been introduced in Congress, which would allow the government to control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is not enough, so he wants to develop his program further so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
The other question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly refuse access to his data, since otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are left to the mercy of the fox.
Global meal plan from Marseille
The European Union and India double trade
As the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners, this was the main topic of the Ninth Summit, alongside other global issues.
The French-Indian summit is also taking place today, and the main topic of discussion is cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
The European Union recognizes that India is an emerging democratic power which should be given more say and say in international affairs, but the Member States have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not even discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.An agreement was reached to double trade to more than EUR 100 billion over the next five years.
Given that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not even an ambitious target.
In this context, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into one agreement, thus also providing a boost to air transport in the future.
India intends to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India's number one partner, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global concerns.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, were among them.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides blaming each other for the failure.
The EU stressed that it was sticking to its energy and climate agenda, which is to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
India agreed to this, as did the proposal to make some kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit, and to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent by 2050.
The European Union and the United States are also committed to the fight against food price increases, and they are therefore in favour of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, on the other hand, the expectation is that French firms will be awarded contracts worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
The European Commission has also been involved in the development of a new European book market.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting over 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries to present over 403,000 titles on its 171,790 square metres of floor space.
The Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities, Maria Giro, will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 m2 exhibition space Punto Italia'.
This will be followed by a press conference in Room Structure, in Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair, where figures, trends and perspectives on the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is declining in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth section.
Billionaire Steve Fossett 's small plane , which disappeared a year ago , has been found .
The small plane belonging to Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The fragments were found on a high plateau at an altitude of 3,000 m in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes region between the states of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson completely debunked the last of his doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, and a team has been dispatched to it, and we now have the certainty that it is the plane that Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared".
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reported that a team was sent out to identify the aircraft, the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on 3 September 2007 after Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight, just hours after it was spotted.
Finally, yesterday, in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal effects were found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs in the name of Fossett, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long string of records.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first human to orbit the globe in a hot air balloon, a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single non-stop flight with an airplane.
Among his many records is a high-altitude flight of 15,445 m over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Look, the commercial you didn't expect
A SUV that stands out from the conventional schemes for its original design and special linearity, its discharge surface and clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector with this off-roader.
The presentation of the Suv Glk, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October, will be unconventional precisely because of its exceptional features.
The advertising drum that will accompany the new model will also be in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign. This is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A high-end project to be carried out in several phases, which will occupy the central shopping area of Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of presenting the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear as a three-dimensional model in its near-real dimensions.
In fact, the car will appear to stand out from the poster on which it is pictured.
The new light is then illuminated at different times in all its details, using the Elumina8 technology, in order to be assembled as a whole.
The aim of this advertising campaign is undoubtedly to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotyped field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers?
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
They 're from Triveneto , now they risk being banned from the stadium .
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, the ones that are now the shame of Italy, the ultra-Italians who have been following the Italian national team for years and who, frankly, have not caused any serious problems until recently?
Never before have there been clashes with rival fans.
The origin of the group is right-wing.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In addition to these, other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia were also present in Sofia.
They wear the Tricolori, which depict the militants' towns, but were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a clash with a truly right-wing fan base, that of Levsky.
Figc had provided Italian fans with 144 cards for the game, all of which were named and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the Viminal: none of those who travelled to Sofia had an ongoing stadium ban.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already charged in this regard, were also denied tickets and travel to Bulgaria.
The criminal is now waiting for the reports from the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the Tifosi arrested or identified during the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban which prevents access to stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans won't set foot in a stadium anymore.
Thank God for that.
But now, of course, there is a fear of imitators who might follow this one by a little over 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that in no way gives any justification for such behaviour", the Viminal said.
"Therefore, eyes on the national team's game on Wednesday in Lecce".
Because in fact, there is a small nucleus of Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Supervision) will be meeting, and on Tuesday the Casms, who can count on a part of the Aise, the secret services dealing with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-duce shouting and raising the right arm during the Mameli anthem?
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio del Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously the police chief of Trieste, where a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now come from.
While it is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, the conduct of these 150-200 persons was undoubtedly a disgrace.
"I'm not a sociologist", adds the number one of the observatory. "Crimes are punished in the country where they are committed.
Until now, this group had kept to itself, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about whistling during the Mamelis hymn: this is not a crime either, but if you'll excuse me, there's no education...
