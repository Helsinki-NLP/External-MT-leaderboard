Members of the National Assembly for Wales are concerned that they look like maps.
Some of the Members of the Assembly are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this could be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour Party Member of Parliament said his party was concerned that everyone was riddling with Twp and Pwp.
For non-Welsh speakers: in Welsh twp means 'distance/madness', and pwp means 'someone'.
A member of Plaid said the party as a whole was unhappy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative Party member said his party was "freely minded" about the name change, but noted that the similarity between the words MWP and Muppet is great.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law to introduce the name changes, stated: The final decision on which words to name the members of the assembly will be made, of course, will be made by the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on proposals indicating strong support for the appointment of the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
For the question of the name of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission prefers Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament have proposed alternative options, but the struggle to reach consensus could cause headaches for Speaker of the House, Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit a bill for the changes within weeks.
The Reform Act will include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying Assembly members and the design for the committee system.
The members of the assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when they discuss the law.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was put in an attempt to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and has consistently opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgy Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not consider the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's have died as churches in Harlem face problems.
"Historically, the old people I spoke to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
Today, neither is there.
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods where people go regularly.
And for churches, he's worried that the money from the sale of properties won't last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later, it'll go back to where it started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced with residential buildings filled with people of the type who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
"Most of the people who buy apartments in these buildings are white", he said, "and so it will be a fast day when these churches close down completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who live in these buildings will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by congregations of whites before Harlem became the metropolis of the Negroes  Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A congregation of black people practicing their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Congregation of the Negroes during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote Negroes.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Priest David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "The Voice of the Poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it differently: cultural treasure and irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dioniscio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Meriwether said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What's been happening in St. Martin's over the past few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, partly brought by the unskilled leaders of the church, and partly by the Episcopal Diocese.
The church board, the governing body of the church, composed of non-professional leaders, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would ask for a transfer of expenses to the church board, although the church board was not involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-old boy in a sled diving accident in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for the California raft on the opening day of rafting season, authorities said.
The attack happened about 7:00 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel said he thought it was the excitement of catching a rabbit, but then he realized he was yelling, "I'm late!"
I'm late!
His entire skeleton was visible, Hamel said he noticed after reaching the boy.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' " added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to San Diego's Rade Children's Hospital, is being treated as critical.
It's unclear what species of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a few weeks earlier a shark had been spotted in the area, but decided the shark was not an endangered species.
Giles added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach from the Ponto side of the beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours due to investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans are entering the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of a department store full of professional assistants.
As part of the significant £2.8bn UK beauty market entrance, which continues to grow as sales in fashion and household decline, the large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out to more stores next year if proven successful.
The investment in beauty came about after supermarkets began looking for ways to use shelf space that was once reserved for televisions, microwave ovens, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it will for the first time double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup line, so most products are vegan-friendly, something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Creydon, South London, last week, and the second in Seeley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend of buying smaller quantities of food on a daily basis in local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coop, Sainsbury's CEO, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounts from Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced a number of Habitat stores after buying both chains two years ago, which they said increased grocery sales and made purchases profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreements over how to share profits from the chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold 281 of its pharmacy stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We've also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our brands are designed to meet every need, and the attractive environment and weather locations mean we're now a must-see beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones has been out of business since Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11m deal.
Star Peter Jones of the Dragons Den left the madness after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This 37-year-old morning talk show host said on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, pulling out of their profitable branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was furious when the television golden girl admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she no longer had time to devote herself to their Truly brand of household goods and accessories.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby's fortune estimated at £11 million.
As 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain for one of his weekends.
One source stated that: Truly has always been at the top of Holly's priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would follow her for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all those involved caught her absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
At Marlow's headquarters there is a warehouse full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of this morning's hostess, who is one of Britain's highest paid stars, could cost the company millions because of large investments in towels and candles, clothing and household goods, and the potential for further delays.
Oh, and that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We're not commenting on his business ventures".
A serious conversation and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for commenting on what some would consider to be "Vice President" and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump announced with his voice changed to "news presenter".
I didn't give up on anything.
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump hailed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization were postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see an adequate response from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
"We're in a good deal with North Korea", he said.
We should have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great collaboration.
He stated that his efforts to improve relations with Kim brought positive results  completed missile tests, helped release hostages and the remaining American troops returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed an island and claimed hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, no elementary disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it is a challenge", Mr. Sumbong said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palo, it is still not certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities were evaluating the situation in Palo to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief efforts.
Because of the constant earthquakes that hit Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in the Aztec region, they are not a common sight on other coasts.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palo, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling through many of Indonesia's islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is headed for Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
A key point in President Joko Widodo's election campaign was improving Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the lack of funds caught up with Mr. Joko's administration in the run-up to the next election.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using masks, bows and arrows and other ancient weapons.
Daniel Sturge of Liverpool's team draws against Chelsea
Daniel Stirridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri gave Stridge the ball about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1  0.
He moved the ball to the left side before heading for the remote post.
The ball was moving high above the 16th as it turned towards the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the leaping Cape Arizbalaga and fell into the net.
"I was just trying to get in that position, get to the ball, and players like Chuck always pass as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as possible", Stridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kant coming up and I just touched her and I didn't think much about it and I just kicked.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue Devils' forward went back five to Matteo Kovacic in that attack, before shooting the ball almost halfway through the field, then sprinting into Liverpool's half.
They quickly surrendered to Kovacic in the middle of the field.
He then fired a missile, leading Hazard into the 16th.
Hazard passed the defence and finished in the net of the long-distance stump with a left-footed shot next to Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videtone in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Many people were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo agency spokesman Purvo Nugarho told a news conference.
The city of Palú, with a population of more than 380,000, was overwhelmed by a barrage of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mows on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who saw or heard something to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something from car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.
Police said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a facility.
After noon, friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and as police have said, they will inform the people closest to the victim.
A cab driver living in Grayson Mowes just tried to get back to his apartment, but police told him he was not allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The tenants have now been informed that it will be hours before they can return.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman dressed in tears appeared at the scene.
She keeps saying it's so awful.
At 2:00 a.m., two police stations were at the border, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers are standing at the border, watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111 citing note 247 of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament has become the latest memorial strike in the history books.
Its persecution would be poetic justice for his Taliban's destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as folly and a failure to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become an object.
The iconic class of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thornecroft's beautiful presentation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of a figure many believe still worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is the defender of parliament from outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the future development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of praise and mention.
Pig-Killer Sparks and Kills a Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, local media reports said.
The man, identified only by his surname Juan, was found dead with a scarred artery, wrapped in blood near a market in Lipanshui, Gizhou Province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to place vaccines on pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and uncovered an open door from the next pigsty.
He stated that there was a large vapour of blood in the wagon.
Forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound vapour tore the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn", said the cousin, nicknamed "Vu", according to a quotation in the evening news of Guyang.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Juan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pigs were locked up to prevent other people from attacking them while police gathered evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been previous reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier a 650-pound pig attached a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife had driven the animal out.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an activator.
They're just playing.
They like to grunt, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone intentionally.
You just have to give them enough respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rainfall to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Rosa brought 85 mph, Category 1 hurricane winds at 5.00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm begins to bring heavy tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the approaching tropical moisture with the depression will create heavy rainfall in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause heavy flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The large tropical rainfall will cause rainfall of about 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Heavy flooding is possible because of rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is especially recommended not to walk in the desert on foot when tropical rain is possible.
Heavy rain can make the canyons a stormy river, and thunderstorms will bring local winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring locally damaging rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Over half an inch of rainfall is possible, which can cause rivers of debris and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region since their wet season.
Temporary tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before rain spreads further late Monday and Tuesday.
The rainfall will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Intense temperature changes are expected throughout the United States in October due to the Arctic's cooling, but the tropics remain high.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A prime example of a dramatic difference in temperatures will be in the central United States on Sunday.
There's almost a 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to re-create and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October with high temperatures in the 80 degrees from the southern plains to the east.
New York City could hit 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our longer-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Kavanaugh's audition
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly occurred in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the unstable political situation continued, with speakers interrupting regular re-election programs at the last minute on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, entered into a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh had stolen her piano and tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent sure that didn't happen.
It's likely that more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to the other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people watching in offices.
To make it better, it's an audience of the same size as a football playoff contest or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose drivers strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with 5.69 million viewers on average during the full-day audition, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him on Friday morning as he tried to get into an elevator for the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes while being reprimanded, and it was all live on CNN.
"They're standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?
He was told, "You have power, but women are so weak".
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before closing the elevator door, that there would be more to say during the committee hearing.
Cable and radio broadcasts all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI that they would consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partially convinced by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and a few senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was of great significance, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called 'Checkers' plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect mutual costs is utterly absurd.
Weed Sims shooting: Police arrested suspect Dithion Simson in the death of Louisiana State University athlete
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old Louisiana State University basketball player.
Twenty-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the Sims-Simpson confrontation, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, said a WAFB affiliate of CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Office of Pathologist released a preliminary report Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police's Refugee Unit, the State Police Criminal Investigation Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for their activism in the pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-6 Beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Sims' death.
"This is what you care about all the time", said the coach.
A volcano has ejected ashes over Mexico City
The ash from the Popocateptel volcano reached the southern settlements of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity began at the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center followed more vibrations and tremors.
Social media images show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City's slums, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with public order and peace police and after thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters held by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and paint into powder, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
Later that day, there were also flares, and the police used the sticks to squeeze the flares.
For more than a few hours, independence groups have been shouting 'No forgetting, no forgiveness', while union protesters have been shouting 'Long live Spain'.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region seeking independence, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low due to boycotts by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police forcefully tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped through the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but they had to change the route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcisse Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would have a chance of gaining independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of joy because they can vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Despite winning a vital but tight regional election last December, the Catalan independence parties struggled to keep pace this year with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-elected exile or in custody awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Juan Puig, recording the protest in support of the police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
"Everything is becoming potentially", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before a trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londoners: men arrested for driving into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly crashing a car into a house in Londonbury.
The incident occurred in Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7.30pm BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemings said damage was done to the lock and the building itself.
At some point, he may have been shot with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the car.
The manga's adventure brought a 1-0 win to Livingston against the Rangers.
The first goal of the Dolly Mango for Livingston ensured a victory
The forward, Livingston, joined Rangers on a signing deal with Steven Gerrard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox club.
The season of Valley Menga proved to be significant as the side of Gary Hold climbed to a level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side went undefeated in the championship this season and will face the Harts next week, who are eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston have gone undefeated in the division over the course of six games, and coach Holt has yet to face a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed his chance against the harsh guests.
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their directness caused many problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his breakthrough, but pulled the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after slipping to play Craig Halcutta's head hit over the goal.
The guests were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems with the stocks placed.
And that's how the decisive goal came about.
Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together replaced Menga, who only scored a touchdown from the centre of the 16th.
By that point, the Rangers had dominated the ball possession, but they couldn't break through the home defense, so goalie Liam Kelly mostly didn't play.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was rescuing Kelly.
Scott Pittman failed to score due to the skill of Rangers goaltender Alan McGregor, and Lithgow took the ball away from another live action set by Livingston.
Livingston's sixteen were constantly passed and consistently defended, while two penalty requests  following Halcett's dispute for replacing Glen Middleton and one for a hand  were rejected.

The phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this upward trail.
Their style and character of play hardly changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halket was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Connor Goldson and Joe Vral on the go.
The Rangers were still lacking in inspiration.
As good as they were once under Gerard, they are now lagging behind by the same standards.
Their last game was a weak one, they only managed to open the hosts once, and that was a little refreshing for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in the Colony
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They were exacerbated by issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The resistance demonstrators portray the split of the visitor being hailed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a busy traffic lane in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and emergency services arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred months after another cyclist died in a Childers Street car accident where the driver fled, about a mile from the Saturday collision.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been put in place and buses have been diverted, and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in a riot
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
The unrest broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado Unit were brought in to resolve the riots, which included eight prisoners and were confined to one wing.
The officers are being treated for minor injuries at the scene.
The prison's spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff were directed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be turned over to the police and may spend additional time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police for public order and peace were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with heavy flooding (may be beneficial to dry areas)
Tropical depressions rarely hit Arizona, but that's likely to be what happens early next week when the remaining strength of Hurricane Rosa passes through the desert southwest region, bringing the risk of severe flooding.
The State Weather Station has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, as far south and east as Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Sweet Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move on a straight path through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late on Monday in rain.
The Phoenix State Weather Station tweeted that only 80 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in the Mongolian edge of Arizona.
Other areas of the desert southwest region, including the central parts of the Carpet Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated areas up to 4 inches of rainfall.
For those outside the flood-prone areas, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is hit by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa led to landslides throughout the Lower California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with cold waters in the Pacific and is receding.
Therefore, rainfall in Mexico is expected to be stronger than tropical storms in the afternoon or evening hours on Monday.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant flood risk.
"It is expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to the northwestern Sonora, with a possible maximum of 10 inches of rain", weather.com said.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah until late evening hours of Tuesday.
The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, the southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States, the State Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening heavy flooding and debris flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police have asked if anyone has cell phone footage of the incident, to stand by.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the greatest anger and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's harshest and most scandalous tactics", Trump told a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered the greatest anger and anger from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasi Ford's allegations that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford testified at the hearing and her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that the Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice for confirmation of one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record in public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the significance of the Republican primary.
Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, he said.
That's why I'm everywhere and I'm fighting for great candidates.
Trump said the Democrats have a mission to resist and prevent.
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, and the total casualties rise
At least 384 people were killed, many swept away by huge waves hitting beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palou on Friday when waves of 18 feet [6.0 m] high hit the coast at sunset, leading many to certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, it hit a tsunami.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were still doing their beach activities and didn't run away immediately, so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the BNPB Indonesia Disaster Management Agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it pulled cars, trees, houses, hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami travelled through the open sea at speeds of up to 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, winding and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The subsequent earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released from the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times greater than the energy released from the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The city's geographical location, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coastline, may have increased the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "a landslide" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the shell of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nuggroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palou, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication was completely damaged with no information from Donggala, Negroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that their staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse", they said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for failing to inform that a tsunami had struck Palo, although authorities said the waves came at about the same time as the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard shouting foolishly, warning people on the street below of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water is crashing onto the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters couldn't immediately confirm the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palo, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
The army began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was planning to visit the evacuation centers in Palo Alto on Sunday.
The total death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palou, where employees took shelter in the shelters of the cherries in their office yard, they passed through scenes of the desert on the way, Mr. Dosemba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's really bad.
Even as relief groups began their dark attempts to start disaster relief, some complained that foreign aid experts were prevented from traveling to Palo.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster", said Auliya Ariani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
When the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can get international aid, but it's not yet status.
As it fell on the second night in Palo Alto after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracle that would ease the dark story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under a gun for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped at the Ro Ro Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of parachute, I have my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, when news of the collapse of the Ro Ro Ro Hotel began circulating in the para-gliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palo who were attending the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a grey stick mark, not a son.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 while filling up an ATM at Newport Harbour.
Thieves on Friday morning stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling out an ATM at Newport Pier, according to a press release from Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car had checked out the ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to replenish it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was meant for delivery.
Witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Jay
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Jay.
He posted the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old West had been using the nickname Jay for some time and used it for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show who had to quit for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think that 'J' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and it means 'J' there", West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
Which means I'm you, I'm us, that's us.
He moved from Kanye, which means the one, to just Yee, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He's one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, Pi DiDi or Diddy, but this year he has released his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West associate Jay Z also uses his name with or without a dash and all capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Vice President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student repressions.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to repress the Mexican people.
The military fired on peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and by opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double funding for AI.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in the field, said investor and AI practitioner Kai-fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the US government made statements about AI, even though the US does not have a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China put in place its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we're looking for the next discovery in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published a month ago by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American player on the body, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee thanked the U.S. government for previous technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes academic leaders, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university experts to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the United States improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to AI PhDs", he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The Chinese State Natural Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Natural Science Foundation and other government organizations spend money on US researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which should include partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Authorized Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Commission on the Safety of Artificial Intelligence had been in effect for months.
The Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change its name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that blocked its EU and NATO membership claims.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and vetoes its membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the left of the referendum read: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies like the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so they can live freely under the banner of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is needed to change the name.
The state Election Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1:00 p.m.
However, turnout stood at 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Joshe Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on 30 September 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads held high, not from the back entrance", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe the majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said the result would be a guarantee for our future.
The poll, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required exit.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television channel Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent will vote yes.
To have a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failed referendum would be the first serious blow to Western government policy since they came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes all of Brighton's defence by a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling quickly mastered Brighton's defence in a 2 0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his hit look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a delivery in the middle of the field at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between three of Brighton's defensive players before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four green ones.
He's got to get around one defensive player before he hits a few others on the edge of Brighton's 16.
He then turned left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first coming to 16 to return the ball to Aguero, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a single hit on the right side of the net.
Aguero has foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We were supposed to play 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to score a goal at that point.
But the Blue Devils' initial advantage gave them Sterling in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful straight ball down the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her a few times before leading Sterling to the remote article.
The attack by the blue sky carried the ball into the net before it was out.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play spoiler against the Rockies.
Since the Nashells were eliminated from the playoff fight, there was no reason to press for another start.
But the always-competitive Scherzer hopes to make his way to the center field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still playoff implications for the Rockies' team, which leads with one game to the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West.
The Rockies had at least one jockey for a spot with a 5-2 win over the Nashville Predators on Friday night, but they are still struggling to cement their place in the top division.
"Even if we're not playing for anything, at least we can throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level of any moment I'll ever face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?
The Nashville Starters are still set to release a starter for the week, but they're reportedly inclined to let Scherzer throw himself into a situation like this.
The 34th-ranked Scherzer trained Thursday and will throw on Sunday, usually off.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The president indirectly mentioned the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court while discussing the importance of Republicans' early election exit.
Everything we've done so far is going to be put on the line in November.
Five weeks to one of the most important elections of our time.
This is one of the big, big  I'm not running, but I'm really fighting, so I'm everywhere fighting for great candidates, he said.
Trump went on, "You look at these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power using all the means at their disposal, you see the evil, the ugliness.
They don't care who they hurt, when they have to step on it to get power and control, that's what they want power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and prevent.
"And you've seen that in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats angry, mean, ugly and untrue.
He mentioned Senator Diana Feinstein of the ranks of the Democrats, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the public responded with shouts of outrage.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Oh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting a little bit. That was very bad body language.
Labour no longer accepts different opinions.
They don't tolerate those who express their opinions
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was almost no surprise.
However, I am only the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party to be told we are not welcome  just because he expresses his opinion.
My fellow MP Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy didn't agree with previous leaders on.
The notice for the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party meeting stated that we would like the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
For most of my eight years as a Labour MP, the Friday night council meetings were just like that.
Unfortunately today, that's not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a kind, gentle policy has long been forgotten, if ever, if ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is being judged as acceptable to the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues I thought we had previously shared a similar political opinion with began to expect me to completely change my mindset and take positions that I would never have otherwise taken, whether it was national security or the internal market of the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly, and it doesn't really matter what I say, there's critical harassment on social media calling for condemnation, rejection of the policies of the Centre, telling me that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist abuse every day, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how abuse levels have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every request for a vote of no confidence or a change in the selection rules, the party becomes more opinionated.
I've gotten a lot of advice over the last two years telling me to keep my head down, not be so loud and then everything will be fine.
But that's not why I came into politics.
32 years ago, when I joined the Labour Party as a student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher's government that literally left my classroom crumbling, I struggled to improve public services for those who needed them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with current leadership.
To those who supported the demand on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country goes to a Brexit drought that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how much condemnation or political opportunism I will survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for East Nottingham
Year 38  17 Melrose: the undefeated Year goes to the top
The two late points may have changed the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderful fun game of the day of the Scottish Rugby League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side out of the top 10.
In the end, it's all because of their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, which have taken the home team, and coach Peter Murchi has a right to be satisfied.
"We've been tested through our matches so far and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christy of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Year, they took their chances better than us.
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Climax, gave Ear a lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors' game, allowed Melrose to improve on the numbers, and Jason Bagot grabbed an unconverted point.
Climone borrowed Ear's lead with a pen, earlier, just halfway through, he scored a point, then converted a solo point to reach 17  5 for Ear in the rescue.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's point, converted by Bagot, cut the lead to five points.
He then had a long hold due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was taken to the carrier, and from the start, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford McDowall's point, converted by Climax.
Ear's VD Captain, Blair McPherson, was then awarded the yellow card and again, Melrose paid for the extra man with an unconverted point to Bruce Colvin at the end of time with relentless pressure.
But the home team came back, and when Straun Hutchinson won the yellow card to knock out Climos without the ball, McPherson pulled a touchdown from the foam line at the back of Ear's sharp attack.
Climax was converting, as he did again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's hit and sent out winger Gregor Henry for the fifth home team point.

The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, for which he is a writer and co-star with longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next season will be their last and it looks like Kirnan is planning for life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun reported that Kirnann was trying to get involved in the successful Glasgow restaurant business.
Bolivia surrounded by land is hoping the ship will reopen the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol a covered-lying naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised a sea blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are inscribed with the motto: "The sea is ours in our right".
It's our duty to get back to you.
From landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the 19th century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the longing to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Their hopes may now be the biggest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivia has momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility and of course expects a positive outcome, said Roberto Calsacia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice's ruling on the big screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia's lawsuit that, after decades of volatile negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant it a sovereign exit to the sea to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president of indigenous origin, who faces a controversial re-election battle next year, is also heavily dependent on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he said in a ceremony at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will likely not rule in Bolivia's favor and that much will not change even if it does.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to allocate territory to Chile and stated that it will not decide on the outcome of the possible talks.
The fact that the International Court's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zarate, an expert on international law from Chile.
And the last four years may have pushed the cause of Bolivia behind it rather than improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has used the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes", Zarate said.
Morales's military rhetoric undermined Chile's remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile and an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement for mutual benefit, he said.
Calsacia also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the sea as a political support.
Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to move beyond the past.
North Korea says it won't achieve nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between rival leaders.
His comments came at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on the verge of resuming blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong-un.
Ri says it is "fiction" to believe that continued US sanctions and appeals for a declaratory end to the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
And Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a lot of skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up its arsenal which the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion houses are unveiling the latest line of massive hats that's on its way to the biggest stores near you.
If you want to improve the size of your drop collections or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a series of oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the track that blurred the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
The extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to the track.
The highlight of Valentino's work was a huge hat with a wide, pear-shaped edge that flooded the model's head.
Other oversized accessories included circus bubbles, magic hats, and even pineapple, but they weren't designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also discovered a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecturer rather than high fashion.
One creature looked like a diving equipment with glasses and a diving tube, and another looked like melted cornet ice cream.
And if you keep up with the huge fashion statement, you're in luck.
Style followers predict that the giant hats could come to stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the two-foot wide straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovski.
The cult fashion house behind the unprofessional hat that spread through social media sent another big creation to the track, a straw beach bag almost the size of the model that pulled it.
The dark orange raffle bag, with a raffle border and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacques's La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing the big beach hats and bags in stores next summer, because the designer has made such an impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, only reinforced by individual and group success in sport, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the careers they choose, and their place as global citizens.
As an educational centre that can design and implement tailored curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable as a subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it makes them imaginary.
If you talk to him in his language, it will hit him in the soul.
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year's recent test results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of 5+.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher 5+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved 5.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages are now viewed as an elective subject on the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school programs, as well as elsewhere.
A survey by the UK's Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 noted that of the reasons employers cited for job failure, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming increasingly obsolete in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what career one chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future in having such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give polyglot an edge over competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 OK adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to talk, and French was the only language spoken by more than 10 percent, or 15 percent of people.
That's why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Having more languages, especially those in developing economies, will equip children with better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school will be different depending on the languages it teaches.
Some schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered most important in OK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing an environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
There's no denying, right now, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this has to be reflected in schools.
In fact, modern languages really should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire (that has to be done).
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron's taking the Lakers to their San Diego debut on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for the fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he'll play is yet to be decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudel tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need preseason games at this stage of my career to prepare", he said.
You Tube channel for Trump rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump has started a series of rallies as part of his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including visits to slopes like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the Supreme Court vacancy is in silence, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm election because Republicans could lose control of Congress by the November vote.
What time is Trump's rally tonight in West Virginia, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Shore time zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online with a live stream on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to turn to the hearing of the man who nominated him to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, which has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with the Senate vote expected to be delayed by a week while the FBI investigation continues.
The primary purpose of the rally series is to help Republicans win a bid for the November election.
So, from President Trump's campaign, they said that these five rallies next week are aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majority, according to Reuters.
"Control in Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as possible as the campaign season begins", a spokesman for Trump's campaign told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Set at the Wesbank Arena in Willing, tonight's rally may attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to Metro News of West Virginia.
Saturday marks Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, a state he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrissey, who is running late in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come to improve the popularity of the polls", said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show courage in the fight to keep alive the hopes of the start of the individual matches on Sunday
After three one-off seasons, Saturday afternoon foursome may have been just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The turning point of luck is a completely fictional sporting concept, but players really believe in it, and especially in games like this.
Who would you say happiness is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now they're four, so we're lucky, I guess", Jordan Spit said after today's game.
The Europeans have an advantage, of course, a lead of four points and 12 games left.
The Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the squad although they have enough momentum, if nothing else then the form of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three out of four points.
Sleep was great and he sets an example.
Those loud shouts of celebration grew stronger during his game, with a key stroke leading to a four-to-four tie when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His 15th game-winning touchdown was interrupted by a similar cry, telling you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to dig deep and take care of your game", Spit said.
That's all any player has left now.
18 holes to score points.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but wonderful duo of Europe is four out of four and they can't go wrong.
They were the only couple without bad hits on a Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad hits on a Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on a Friday morning.
That series and the way it looks like their energy flows up and down this noisy group ensures that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will secure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's assumed that both are simultaneously in different holes.
However, the talk of European fame remains unjustified.
Bob Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the double, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A missed shot and two doubles out of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, though, there's no one who can help you out of the hole.
Couples and couples are so fascinating to watch from close range because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give each other, the advice they don't listen to, and the way the strategy can change all of a sudden.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus gained a significant lead on the final day, but the season of fours also showed that the U.S. team could fight although some, especially Americans, doubted.
The Europeans led 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's 10-6 lead in doubles and fours over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two wins while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead so far at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, struggling to retain the trophy they lost to Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the American team that had a lot of mistakes in the morning doubles and won the series 3-1.
The Americans held out more in the Quartet, winning two games, but they couldn't get the lead.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Mollywood after the sensational weekend, are the second pair overall to score four points in the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles they performed well, beating out the exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson DeShambu with an even more pronounced score of 5&4.
Woods, who has been through two swords on Saturday, at times played well, but now has lost 19 of 29 games in doubles and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the morning doubles, returned as partner to Henrik Stenson in the fours with a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not happy with their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a two-point mark for the Americans on Saturday.
They achieved a decisive 2&1 win over the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and came back later to beat Pulter and Rory McClroy 4&3 in the fours, but lost on the opening, two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have a certain team recovered from a four-point deficit in an individual game, although as title holders, Furyk's team had a fairly even score to retain the trophy.
Since it was the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to have stayed above them.
North Korea says there's no chance of disarmament unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and that there was no chance the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Health Organization's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken significant measures of goodwill last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites, and pledging to combat nuclear weapons proliferation and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an adequate response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such conditions there is no way to unilaterally disarm first.
Although Ri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to nuclear disarmament approach in phases, according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral, non-discussed nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim committed to work toward nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump gave assurances about North Korea's security.
North Korea demands a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States maintains that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to yield to strict international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on nuclear disarmament first and foremost, and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by force, even opposing the declaration of an end to war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can get us down on our knees is a vain dream for people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not mention the plans for a second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: "If the other side in this nuclear disarmament problem were South Korea, instead of the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have ended in such a mess".
Nevertheless, the tone of Lee's speech was significantly different from last year's, when he declared before the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korean missiles to the American mainland was inevitable after the angry President Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, much later praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps, but said that much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeline for it, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council's sanctions must continue fully and without exception until complete, ultimate nuclear disarmament is confirmed".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent funding for Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only hours later due to gangster demands.
North Korea has agreed to meet Moon this month over the disarmament of a missile facility and a nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
He said Kim told him that the appropriate measures he's asking for are the security guarantees Trump has given to Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend classes to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates to sleep more in order to combat the growing macroeconomic culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world's leading universities often know nothing about basic self-care.
Charles Chazler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course for what he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of poor sleep on learning.
"At the end of the show, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are you telling me this now, last year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me, he told Telegraph.
The course, which was first offered this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help with academic and athletic outcomes and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief health officer, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a student home where students press coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how poor sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routines.
On the other hand, participants learn about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart and stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe that they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke", Professor Chazler added.
The culture of pride in working all night long still exists, he said, and modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Having enough, good quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid becoming obese, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into fasting mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chazler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act as a course throughout the student city.
He hopes the next step is to require all graduates to complete a similar program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Chazler recommends that students consider setting an alarm when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which displaces the circadian rhythm, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The Manga's head has knocked Gerard's men down
The Rangers suffered another defeatful, sad day when the Dolly Mengo blow sent Steven Gerrard's dissolved team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Aybrokes wanted to record their first win since their 4-1 victory in St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's side inflicted a second defeat to Gerard's side in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the record-setting Harts in the Scottish Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' attitude lost inspiration and chances to level.
Now the Rangers have dropped to sixth place, and Livingston has moved up to third, and they're just behind Hibernian in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for the Rangers after linebacker Judge Callum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after being apparently hit by a remote object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that beat Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played the same 11 Livingston had won a point with Harts last week and would have been delighted with the way his well-adjusted stance stifled opponents at every opportunity.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball possession, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after the start when the first game of the Menga kicked Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Then a long-range kick from Kihan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only play openly in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should get a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Stephen Lawless collided, but Judge Stephen Thomson did not sign the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half, but former Aybrokse goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not tire of the head-stroke by Lassan Kullibali and the weak hit by Ovi Edaria.
Although Livingston's 34th minute start may have been a bit of a backlash, no one can deny that they deserved it according to their game.
Once again the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's strike.
Scott Alfred didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who cold-headedly chose Manga for a simple ending.
Gerard reacted during the half when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the wingman passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a block.
But Livingston managed to lure guest players to play the type of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Hackett capturing many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor was well positioned and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head in front of Litgow.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another penalty claim after he collided with Jacobs, but Thompson again refused.
Almanac: The user of the Geiger counter
And now a side of our almanac on Sunday morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we celebrate... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, it has become a major focus of science, the hyggers' counter has become a major focus of popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Colorado House, starring these seemingly unreliable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: This is a geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms releasing radioactivity into the minerals.
- Say, that must be jumping now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look at the compromised cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to look at the damaged cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize compromised cells as part of treatment.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and replacing them in a laboratory
You can see protein honor in many cancers, and then you can get it back into the body.
The trial vaccine has been promising in patients with multiple cancers.
In one woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize compromised cells, ovarian cancer disappeared within 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the lab so they can see a protein called HER2 in many cancers, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzowski of the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a vaccine that promises a lot".
HER2 go promotes the growth of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells works in treating a specific type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump comeback, carrying a drop with his motto, after a Saturday night live performance.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live broadcast on Saturday night, following a useless performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing the third song that night, called City of Spirits, which he wore a drop with the inscription "Make America Glorious Again", he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
"Often when I talk to a white man they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's a racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have emigrated from America a long time ago, he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault against Christine Blaisey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the West's fall footage was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with the ad.
West also complained to the audience that he had difficulty getting behind the scenes because of his drop.
I was laughed at behind the scenes.
They told me not to show up with that drop.
They were laughing at me!
Then they told me I was in the sunken site, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The news went on, "Do you want to see the bottom of the ocean?" He said he was going to put on his Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to do it with love".
His comments drew public outrage at least twice, and the evening show crew looked embarrassed, Variety reported, a man told the publisher: "The whole studio is ignorant".
The news was brought as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mack Miller, died a few days ago.
I know a lot of people were surprised by the song "I love it" dressed like a bottle of Perry.
The news was backed by the leader of the conservative TPSAD group, Candace Turner who tweeted: "For one of the bravest spirits: I thank you for your efforts and your support.
But the host of the show Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was his own, and that's absolutely wonderful.
But I have chosen NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) for believing that they embrace and spread an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So did we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, by which time he is now formally known as Kane West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
Co-rapper, Snoop Dogg, goes by the name Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to the artist from previously known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder in a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Balihkhammore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
The charges will be heard by the public prosecutor.
The star of the Game of Thrones series, Keith Harington, attacked a toxic male
Keith Harington is best known for his role as the skilled swordsman John Snow in the violent, medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often mean young boys feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture section, Keith said he believes something is wrong and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #NowSay era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has strong feelings about the issue.
"I personally have strong feelings, right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
What do we teach men as they grow up about the problems we see now?
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: "What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street that makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because obviously something's wrong with young men.
In the interview he also admitted that he would not be participating in the Game of Thrones sequel when the series ended the following summer, saying that it ended with battles and horses.
From November, Keith will be appearing in the remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which is a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that ever came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way she gave me my future family and my future life", he said.
Rose played Egrit, a character who had a love interest with Keith's character, John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14 percent jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, China's health authorities told a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grew by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people from the LGBT community is high.
Because of the conservative values of the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of the disease is due to inadequate sexual protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies data submitted by a member of staff related to a Republican Party senator as dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has asserted that the claims are of far-right sympathizers and web sites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill while the Senate hearing panel was holding allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, a nominated Supreme Court justice.
The information was released shortly after Kavanaugh was questioned by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post is linked to the Waters office and information about a member of Waters' staff has been published, Hill reported.
"These unfortunate accusations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie", Waters continued.
"The member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security are compromised as a result of these false and false accusations - is in no way responsible for the information provided.
The unfortunate accusations are completely false and are absolutely false.
Waters' statement quickly attracted criticism on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Flasher.
These denials are nerve-wracking, wrote Flasher.
This shows that she has no temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they should not be angry.
He must not be challenged.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and calm.
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also announced on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's a big deal", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the relevant institutions and police of the false allegations.
We will allow the perpetrators to be exposed, she continued, and they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all members of my staff.
The thought of Johnny English is attacking again - undermining Rowan Atkinson's espionage scams
It's now traditional to look for Brexit elements in every new British-related film, and that seems to apply to this reboot of the fraudulent, action comedy franchise Johnny English - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Born Again.
Will the careful self-mocking of the subject of how obviously we are to nowhere be the new export opportunity that the nation has?
Yet the big-eyed, much-groomed face of incompetent Johnny English was licensed to do things a second time - his name primarily denotes that he is a widespread comic creation, made for movie audiences in non-English speaking countries.
He is of course a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts to make a careful glamour somewhat resembling Clouseau, has drawings of Mr. Bean and part of the boy playing a note from the song "Cariots of Fire" from the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympics.
Its basis is the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once starred in the now-forgotten Barclays TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There's a moment or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor feathers hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somewhat superficial, especially since serious movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible also contain elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as inventive and focused as the silent jumps of Atkinson's character Bean.
The theme that's been going around the block is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated a super-secret spy network in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of the agent in office - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
In the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and combative figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown in political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best in this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is nothing special about the script that she would be working with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that since every active spy is compromised, she'll have to activate one of the retired.
And that means calling in Johnny English himself who now works as a private school teacher, but black gives classes to secret agents: there are some good guys here, when English offers a spy school that looks like a rock academy.
English is promptly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, about a submarine commander, a comedic role in which Vicky Pepperdine is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, to make a mess of everything at the Royal Secret Service are back in action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Bouletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd acts: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a mess after they mow themselves on the luxurious yacht of the Volta; and English starts a real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality hat to get to know the interior of the Volta house.
All the buggers were removed for the final sequence, but as polite and noisy as it is, there's plenty of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice moderate things.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can't help but think: can't the British film industry give him a role as Rowan Atkinson who will use his talent?
Labour denies they're planning on keeping the British working four days a week, but getting paid five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan that British people will work four days a week - but be paid five.
The party is reportedly wanting company bosses to use the savings they're making with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
The workers would enjoy a three-day weekend - but they would get the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea is consistent with the party's economic agenda and plans to make the country more workers-oriented.
The passing of the four-day workweek was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking member of the party told the Sunday Times: "The strategy review should be published before the end of the year.
It will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is an endeavor that is in line with the Party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party will not be the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party was betting on a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the aspiration was not accepted by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's strategy and the party does not consider such an idea".
Shadow Chancellor John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his vision for a socialist revolution of the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from the faceless directors and the profiteers in utilities.
The shadow office's plans also mean that current shareholders in water supply companies may not get all of it back because the Labour government could make deductions for unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to join the boards of companies and to set up Inclusive Property Funds with 10 per cent of private company capital going to employees, who can take an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy are giving a statement for 60 minutes about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change them.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updates the question of whether the bureau's findings could prompt some Republican senators to withdraw support.
In an interview published Sunday, 60 Minute correspondent Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would make them think.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"I think of course", Kennedy said.
I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the charges came out, and I said, "Did he do this?"
He was firm, determined, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, however, seems to be digging into a rock.
"My decision was made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking indictment is needed", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it vigorously", Graham added, thinking of Christine Blaisey Ford.
All the names she names could not be confirmed.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring celebrity stars with an impressive mission: ending poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people who will come to the large lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, a phone call, or some other useful activity that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Golbalan Citizen because he has 12 years left to complete?
Is the idea of a free concert really a way to convince people to want to take something or just another case of click activism -- people who feel they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million activities from supporters, which have been operating for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped to inspire world leaders to announce commitments and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and that will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and citations that resulted from their activities, of which $10 billion has already been sent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds raised directly benefit nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges are the Food Power, a UK-based partnership of investors and implementers dedicated to helping children reach their potential, which has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help the country with malnutrition after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a landmark", said Ambassador Tracy Allman of Food Power, to a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said over 5,000 activities were taken up related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the project, The Power of Ischranta, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, why do you think you can end extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long, hard road -- we're never going to make it.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists performing at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
America could use the Navy to blockade Russia's energy exports.
Washington could use the Navy if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
According to Zinka, Russian involvement in Syria - namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is because of the energy market, just like they're doing in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe", he said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade their energy to the market", he said.
Zinc addressed attendees at an event organized by the Energy Consumers Alliance, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the voice of energy consumers in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to increase investment and replace fuel", he said, while talking about Russia as an unfavorable downside to an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to back off the North Tech 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a slave to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nordtek 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, should double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is just an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that customers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude was met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of European energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy procurement", said Dieter Kemf, first man of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider whether to run for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the Holyoke, Massachusetts, city council, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman at the helm", she said, according to Hill.
After November 6, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.
Warren evaluated President Donald Trump's work during the city council meeting and said he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he's nominating for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the most likely Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University's Center for Political Research/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent support such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's nomination, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent opposing.
Other notable names from the Democratic Party discussing the nomination in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll officially make a decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin is talking about the post-traumatic syndrome of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally.
Track Paylin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he turned himself in in September.
He was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he came back, I know how other families are feeling torn apart by the trauma and the wounds that our soldiers are coming back with", she told a crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paine called the arrest a "lion in the room" and said that her son and other military veterans are coming back a little different, they come back reinforced, they come back and they wonder if there's respect for what they and their fellow airmen, and every other member of the military has given for the country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the city of Washington support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support a challenge to a new American policy that prevents asylum from victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition in court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who is challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner and the gang members abused her, but the US authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was locked up in Texas.
The State's attorney representing Grace describes El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, the origin of many of the U.S. asylum claims, as nations with persistent gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. public defender Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy ignores decades of legislation at the federal, state and international levels.
Federal law requires all asylum claims to be adapted to the particular facts and circumstances of the application and such provision violates that principle, according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, the letter's advocates argue that immigrant entry policy is harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs to offer the required workforce.
Public defender Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in a policy presentation on June 11.
Asylum was never conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palo because the death toll is doubling in the race to find survivors.
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she was caring for her baby boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Pallu.
Every minute, ambulance vehicles carry bodies.
There's no clean water.
Residents return to their destroyed homes and pick up their alleged items to save what they can.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Duy Harris, who has broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palou Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside, due to frequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the powerful quake in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, so I think Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of maltreating with propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-party ad in a U.S. daily newspaper listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke about the paid addition of the Tea Daily to the De Moyne Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections on November 6, China rejected the accusation.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election marked a move by US intelligence to Reuters, a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war in which they equalize import tariffs with each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were targeted at exporters from states like Iowa, which back Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, China's top agricultural exporter, said Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Brannstad wrote in a column in the weekly De Moyne Register, is now doubling the amount of bullying by propaganda ads in our free press.
In disseminating propaganda, the Chinese government abuses the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the Des Moines Register wrote Branstad.
"In contrast, in the nearby newsstand here in Beijing, you can find only a limited number of opinions and you won't see a real reflection of the desperate opinions the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the strong hand of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's most widely read newspapers rejected his offer to publish the column, though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are moving away from women's voices ahead of the midterm elections, due to the debate with Kavanaugh, analysts warn.
Because many Republicans do not watch or defend Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially from women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong and most Republicans have already stated they want to continue voting.
There's no going back from that kind of thing, wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, about Hill in a column published Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that pressure for an FBI investigation of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona Republican) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, Friday, in a Washington, D.C. news release.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted 'November is coming!' during a protest in the Senate lobby when Republicans, who control the legal affairs committee, decided to continue with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high", said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site.
People already say they're tall; that's right.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court justice nominee, analysts suggested that there could be negative consequences if Republicans continued to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote in the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it's about how the Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, for the news channel.
However, Americans are divided over who to trust after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, although a majority accept the first-mentioned side.
A new Yu-Gov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied in the testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's allegations, as well as at least some others, against Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh, in a drunken state, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses her Supreme Court justice nominee of showing her genitals at a party while they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The World Wide Web user plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrappt, is a company that's built on the solid open source platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of the start-up business.
Now is the historic moment.
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own online database, or POD for short.
It may contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify to all be available on one browser at the same time.
What's unique about the personal data warehouse of the Internet is that it's up to the user who has access to a particular type of information.
The company calls it personal data empowerment.
Inrappt's idea, according to CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process and appropriate skills for Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developer contractors for the project, and a community of coding volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inraptop website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to implement a complete change where their business models are completely upside down overnight.
We don't need their permission.
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrap's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Network Consortium of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Lately, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the debate over Internet neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrappt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the new era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross-bearer from World War I
The only Anglican priest to receive the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, the Honorable Bernard Van received his commission on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Belenglish and LeHacourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had received Britain's highest military distinction.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was an incredible symbolism that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the distinction.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Colonel Van led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin under very thick fog and heavy fire from cannons and machine guns.
He later ran to the shooting sites and with the greatest of bravery led forward, before attacking a cannon-nest himself and disabling three of the attendants.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather's work was something I know I'll never be able to accomplish, but it's something that makes us humble.
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was a great honor to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people.
Fans of Combined Martial Arts stayed up all night watching Belator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig.
Imagine you're up all night watching Belator 206 and not having the chance to watch the main event.
The San Jose roster contained 13 fights, including six with the main card that were shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gerard Mussey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in Britain were stunned when the channel switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed by the early hours of the fight.
One Twitter fan described the transfer of a child's cartoon elephant as some sort of sick joke.
"The law is that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to move to a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked for the broadcast.
♪ A pig's ass, yeah ♪
The president of the company, Belator Scott Cook, said they would work on a schedule that would include viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think when I think about releasing again, I think we can probably find a solution", said Cook.
But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we won't be able to find a solution on Sunday, our time, and Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we got a lot of messages on the transfer, and none of them were kind.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it wasn't. It was a legal matter.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We're going to limit the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and we're trying to deliver more for the fans and we're overreacting.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a desert island: Tom Daley felt inferior to his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he was in high school that everyone wasn't like me.
Speaking on the first show Discs on a Desert Island on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the long-running show Kirsty Young has taken a month-long vacation due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt less than everyone else as he grew up because it was socially unacceptable to have sympathies for boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority and difference were the things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist became a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without division and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "takes us by surprise".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such an early age - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it's hard to find someone of his age who has experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June, of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that all his views had changed.
If you asked me last year, it was all about "I need to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father refused to die and one of the last things he asked them was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't here to be in the front row", he said.
I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died I finally realized he was invincible.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I'd dreamed of my whole life - jumping in front of a home crowd at the Olympics, it didn't feel better", he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Pride of Heder Small - which he had been thinking about in preparation for the Olympics and was still getting excited about.

Mickelson, Con's not in shape. He was at the club during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this week when he plays the 47th Ryder Cup, but he'll have to change his form to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event, a record 12th time, was sent to the club by Captain Jim Furick during the Saturday doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the United States often represents, the five-time winner, he divided his time to curve and practice his game, the range, in the hope of correcting what was silencing him.
Never the best driver, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where long-range rough strokes are a regular penalty for negligence.
And if the pitch itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson, in Game 9 this week, faces the defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who is playing in a match with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who are down four points from 12 individual games, start off bad, Mickelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched my back and put his hand around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a celebrity and he's given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think it was like playing two games.
I thought about it more, but it went like this, and we thought we had to do it.
He likes to play, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldon's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup this week.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career where he never achieved the best results of his individual career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk said his presence carries something intangible with the team.
He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's sensitive, he likes to joke with people and he's a great guy at team meetings", he explained.
I think the younger players were having fun playing with him, like this week, which was fun to watch.
He offers much more than just playing games.
European Captain Thomas Byrne knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before individual matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a private position.
Dancer made his debut at a game at Waldera in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Ballesteroz had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they only crossed the finish line with their noses, with a minimum lead of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I remind myself we had a great lead at Walderam; we had a great lead at Brooklyn, when we lost and at Walderam, when we won by a short margin", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the class of 2018 win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this isn't over.
Go get ready for tomorrow.
Come out and play it right.
This isn't over until the game is over.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win the trophy, and the focus is on that.
I mean, I'm focusing on 12 players on our team all the time, but we're fully aware of the opposing side -- the best players in the world.
Bjorn added, pleased with the results of his players on the hard court: "I don't want to give an early assessment on that question.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We're having individual games tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you play individually, then you test all your golfing abilities.
That's the message that should be sent to the players, to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner and he has to give his best.
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will require players to play better individually than in pairs, with the exceptions being Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the spectrum on the final day, as he was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the "Medicine"
"I remember every word there", he said when asked how Ben Cran Shaw, captain in 1999, brought the players together before the last day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, like we saw in Medina.
When the momentum moves in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the midfield.
We're setting the line up properly and the order of the team is based on how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with facing Rory McClurey first and facing Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I decided to do this with the guys because I think that's how we're going to cover everything", Björn said of the individual game selection.
The new German warship is again delayed
The German Navy's latest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War-era warships, but that won't happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rhineland-Fulz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Whitemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing an army spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014 but problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Whitemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
They are known to contain powerful cannons, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Other important features include less maintenance - it should be possible, the latest ferries, to be absent for up to two years from home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships - which should enable Germany to have power over the oceans - will be outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 misfortune frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key software and hardware defects that rendered the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Whitemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was drastically overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Fulz weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - also became a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the new frigates are particularly important because of warnings of a declining German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, confirmed that the navy was missing ships that could be deployed.
The representative said the problem had worsened over time, because old ships were withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Whitemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
National mourning is listening to the secret life of the bats
A new survey of property in the Scottish Highlands is being conducted to discover how bats use the range to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will provide answers to the unique behaviour of flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The National Trust for Scotland scientists' study will follow the common and soprano lilies, as well as the long-eared brown lilies and the dowbenton lilies at Inverview Gardens in West Ross.
Special cameras will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the bats during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analyses from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the species of bats.
A map of the habitats will then be drawn to give a detailed picture of their behaviour in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to the bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect habitat loss and loss.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do fly adhesive tape and some chemical treatments of building materials, as do attacks by domestic cats.
The bats aren't actually blind.
However, their nighttime hunting habits have made their ears less prone to prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which manages more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organisation even established Scotland's first and only butterfly reserve on the Trive estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is the perfect territory for them.
"We have a great area for butterflies here in Trive", he said.
We have old buildings, very old two and very good housing.
But there's a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses that it is important to check for fleas before renovations are done to the properties because unintentional destruction of the bed can destroy up to 400 females and infants, and destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture, disturb, or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Butterfly Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about bats and about our other species, we just don't know how they live".
Ronaldo has denied the rape charges, and lawyers will sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations fake news, adding that people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Majorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Apparently, he then paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as false news.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, what are you doing?
What was carried out today is fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in front of his camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for mentioning my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a lucky man and everything is fine. The player added laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they called "unacceptable transmission of suspicions from private life", according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Scherz said the player will claim damages for moral damages in addition to an amount that matches the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident was reportedly in June 2009 at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a 99 percent good guy but gave up under that 1 percent.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed they had sex, but there was consent.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed from her injuries in hospital, but later agreed to a settlement without judicial involvement because she feared reprisal and was worried she would be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she's now asking to change the deal because she has injuries from the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus on a deal worth 100 million euros.
Britain will always regret losing carmakers
Britain will always regret losing its status as the world leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britain had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily halt production at the plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
We need a deal, Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border stagnation in the case of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March there will be a production halt at our factory", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will function when they leave the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
B-M-W, for example, says it's closing its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what carmakers call the logistics chain risks in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on a "time-by-time" system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU, for cars on order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a border crossing that the industry says could cause delays and parts shortages.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily inventory supply at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was sufficiently developed to avoid such border checks.
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only to succeed in the present, but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence not only from Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.
Toyota could not say how long production would be shut down, but it warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that its members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once I take those jobs off, they will never come back.
According to a government spokesman: We have put together a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, the White House said.
Donald Trump's important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be postponed for another week as the battle for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia and potential violations of laws by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby threaten Miller's independence has sparked discussions in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a tape recorder for Trump's conversations and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House intending to resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not like to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a collision with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be held this week, or it could be postponed for another week given all the things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see how things go, and I always try to keep the press informed.
Some journalists dispute the claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The conductor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings was not due to the unwillingness to the large influence of television journalists, though he added: "I would agree with the fact that they have a large influence".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is holding more question and answer sessions than any president before him", she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers".
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but if the press has the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States questions, it is far better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this more often, and you can see we've been doing it more and more over the last few weeks, and conversations with the president of the United States will replace briefings for reporters.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely attends independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why by his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of the press.
Secretary for Health with a letter to EU workers employed in Scotland's national health system on Brexit fears
The Secretary of Health wrote a letter to EU workers employed by Scotland's national health system expressing their gratitude to the country and their wish to remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, Member of the Scottish Parliament, sent this letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the costs of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: 'The negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued throughout the summer, with the aim of reaching the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of a deal.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and are of benefit to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, the defensive lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's game when the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, the head coach at Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before midseason.
"He came to the sideline of the playground and just collapsed on the ground", said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the field, then put him in a container and took him for further evaluation.
A spokesman for Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is still no information about the type/degree of injury and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecromby is a sophomore and is playing his first season in redshirt at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He made a total of five saves on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 saves this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when they buy property in the UK
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when they buy property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters.
The higher administrative fees will be charged to those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The ministry expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year, funds to be used to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay higher administrative fees when they buy property in the UK, and that these additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract young voters with his pledges to provide affordable housing and focus on high-income individuals.
The higher administrative fee will be charged to tax-free individuals and businesses in the UK, with additional funds to strengthen the Government's efforts to improve the situation of the homeless.
The additional amount which, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and the purchase of the property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects this move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which has led to rising prices and made it difficult for first time homebuyers to get involved in this process of buying housing.
Many affluent areas in the country, especially the capital, have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy was released just weeks after Boris Johnson requested a lower administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of offering high prices on land-holding properties but not using them and asked Mrs May to change the quotas for access to housing in order to remedy the shameful housing situation in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including tenant controls and ending evictions without a justified reason.
He also wants to give the councils more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to returning to the British dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for non-UK residents and foreign companies to be able to buy homes as easily as valued British residents.
The dream of owning one's own home for many people has become too far off, and the humiliation of the homeless too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to rule Scotland
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, said his ultimate ambition was to become manager of the Scottish national team in the future.
The 42-year-old Scottishman enjoys the challenge of reviving the North East club who are currently third in the Premier League with just three points short of the top club.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad and something always pulled me back.
However, such an opportunity could only be given to me if I was successful in running the club.
Some of Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardite, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic says he felt no discomfort knowing he should follow such established names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My success at the moment is assessed by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League".
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he is undoubtedly a member of the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task for this club to get there, but I'll probably think I've achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.
Ross worked as a manager for only three years, a career he entered after working as an assistant to the boss at Dumbbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of the coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to League Three and brought St. Mirren back from the brink of losing the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably a real crusade for me", he recalls taking on the "Alloa".
I honestly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I made enough money from it, and I enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There's a lot you have to go through on a Sunday.
I still go through some things in terms of stress and work pressure, but I just feel good as a manager.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I do, in this role I feel more comfortable than I have ever felt in my entire adult life.
You can hear the entire interview on Sportsound on Sunday, 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST (British Summer Time)
According to one study, the perfect time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to increased profits for British pubs which are currently in a very difficult situation but put greater pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that pubs and bars saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the business consultancy firm CGA said in determining these figures: The sunny weather and longer than England's expected World Cup participation meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when pub profits increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants declined significantly.
The 1.8 percent drop in sales of restaurants in June worsened even further during July.
Pubs and bars that sell mainly beverages saw much higher growth compared to previous years compared to restaurants where declines were noted.
Pubs where food is sold predominantly were also badly affected by sunny periods, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased 6.6 percent during the month, and sales of food by only three percent.
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling outside the home market.
It is no surprise that restaurants are still in a difficult situation, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales over the course of a year will be particularly striking as a supplement to current cost pressures.
The long warm summer could not have come at a worse time for the owners of the local grocery store, and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August would provide much needed rest.
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in new brands being released.

One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some as young as 11, has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents and teachers.
The survey, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears that such profiles will be posted with sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a headline profile that showed them to their parents.
One in five children, some of whom are only 11, creates a social media profile that hides it from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Instagram profiles, short for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has raised fears that such profiles are being published with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean headline profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret profile on the same day came across a teenager who was asking others to rape him.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is secret.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can't find them".
Elide Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Athletics team.
Elide Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those who are part of the sport's leadership to draw on her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and world athletics community has a great deal of respect for Elid and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly if she became a member of the board", said Beatty.
Doyle said: 'I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really make my contribution and help to the right direction of the sport in Scotland.'
The American who won the 200 and 400-meter medals at the 1996 Atlanta Games, despite winning a total of four Olympic gold medals and who now appears regularly as a commentator for BBC, was unable to attend after suffering a transient Ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't go.
Doctors told me that only time would tell if I recovered or to what extent.
The whole process was a pain, but I was able to fully recover, and I can go back and do agility exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
The breast pump advertising in which mothers are compared to cows has sparked a split opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company sparked a split in the Internet when it posted an advertisement that compared breastfeeding mothers to begging cows.
To mark the launch of what is said to be the world's most powerful breast pump, user-oriented technology company Elvie has released a humorous music video-inspired ad to showcase the freedom the new pump provides to newborn mothers.
Four mothers dancing in a cow barn full of hay to a song whose lyrics are like, "Yes, I'm breastfeeding milk, but you don't see a tail". And "If you haven't noticed this, it's not a whimper, these are my breasts".
The refrain continues: "Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, wipe my breasts".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlighted the dairy industry's concerns.
A really bad decision is to use cows to advertise this product.
They, like us, must get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them just days after they are born, says one commenter.
The Elvie's breast pump is discreetly fitted into the breastfeeding unit (Elvie/Mother).
Another commentary reads: "It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?
Someone else added: "Really inappropriate advertising".
Others, however, defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really funny.
I think this idea is brilliant.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow because of the cheating.
The ad is a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
It's a brilliant product, one of the comments said.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who milk themselves (often at their workplaces or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that flatters or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while the discrete pumps were being peed into their braces.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the pump of Elvie is completely silent, without wires, or pipes, and is discreetly fitted into the breastfeeding room, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies, and even leave the house while they milk.
Anna Ballarin, partner and RDR at Mother commented: Elvie's pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By putting the parallels between women who milk and dairy cows we wanted to put milk-pumping and the challenges that bring it to the spotlight, thus showing the incredible sense of freedom that brings the new pump in a fun and intimate way.
This isn't the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all headings.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the fashion track for designer Martha Jacobovsky carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly although border crossings at the monthly level have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the fact that the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared threatening their own stay in the country if they asked to be a child sponsor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albanes, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress last week that the agency had arrested dozens of individuals who applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally residing in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That's why we're continuing to pursue those individuals", Mr. Albanes said.
To speed up the processing of child cases, authorities have introduced new rules that some of them will be required to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say they voted for the previous standard.
Many of them will appear via conference video call, not in person, to take their legal status case to the immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children stay in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent attacks or attempted escape, say shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in the past few months.
Lawyers say that such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where because of its size, signs of a child's difficulty are more likely to be ignored.
They added that moving children to a tent city without providing them with enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could increase the trauma that most of them already face.
Syria has told the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Mu'alem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally staying in Syria on the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that they would be dealt with accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately without conditions", he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the war on terrorism was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to wage this holy battle until we clear all Syrian territories of both terrorist groups and all illegal foreign presence.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muallem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused some Western countries of spreading irrational fears that motivate refugees to stay out.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns", he said.
They're politicizing the issue that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria would not be provided reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was reached to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a tampon zone at the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement has clear deadlines and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including the fighters of the Nusra Front linked to al Qaeda, who will be eradicated.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will soon be made up of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to "examination of the members of the current constitution", and warned of the consequences of further interference in the same.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again unless impeachment and scandal terminate his presidential term early, as most liberals are likely to hope.
In what will undoubtedly be the most dramatic presidential finale ever seen!
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue among viewers.
Since 2014, the strike time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen says that Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up 1.7 million from the four-year period, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has reached the top cable ratings with about 3.5 million viewers in evenings when major news is being reported.
"It's like a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", says Neil Bauer, the executive producer of ABC's "Designated Survivor" for a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her she was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
He replied, "Because I think it's really funny", Mrs. Scovel told me.
There's a certain amount of fun in all the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can shape the future of the Roy v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can be reunited, and the well-being of the global economy.
Excluding all of this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you're no longer an uninformed citizen when you've been watching a panel of experts for six hours debating the use of the source of deep background by Bob Woodward for his book Fear, the $15,000-dollar leather jacket bombshell by Paul Manafort (Clothes with thick arrogance, as he called it The Washington Post) and the implications of the shocking descriptions of Mr. Trump's anatomy by Daniel Storms.
I, for example, will never be able to see Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what he does and what makes you feel like watching a reality show is that every night he brings you something new", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars for the Trump show's rotating team and daily reviews.
You can't afford to miss a single episode because then you won't be able to make up for it.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while filming on CNN.
He couldn't stop watching, at least not when Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in critical condition.
"I remember doing all those crazy shows in the past and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.' " Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Flow of foreign funds in the tightest midterm elections in the upper house race
Not surprisingly, the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania is receiving a large amount of funding from the reorganization of congressional districts from which two candidates are in the race for the same seat.
This recently renovated Pittsburgh suburb is being run by Democrat Rep. Connor Lamb, who won another district seat in last spring's special election.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th Congressional District, which largely overlaps with the new 17th Congressional District.
The maps were amended after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were being manipulated in favor of the Republicans, which is unconstitutional.
The race in the new 17th congressional district is a tough campaign finance contest between the major party sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the March 18 Pennsylvania Congressional District by-election, which was characterized by widespread media coverage.
For more than a decade, this seat has been held by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give little advantage to the Democrats.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, and then resigned.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners fired the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore", State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But only for El Salvador were sanctions taken into account, which received US aid of about US$140 million in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed the high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from making their way to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had stressed they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any consideration of El Salvador's punishment.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the mid-October conference as a sign of the importance the administration is attaching to the meeting, diplomats say.
All three U.S. officials quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any news of harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate that were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and who also spoke about the state of anonymity.
Learn about history
The next thing that could happen is the release of Special Counsel Robert Miller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, which there is currently very strong evidence in the public record.
Mr. Miller is also allegedly directing his investigation to the fact that Mr. Trump's campaign is linked to Russia in its attack on our election.
If the makeup of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to take responsibility in that body as he prepares to reappear before voters, and possibly before a panel of his colleagues.
There's a lot of uncertainty going on here, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, or his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler if the West opposed and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerating or delaying.
Americans now face several such turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump resigned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein is on the hot bench after this newspaper published that last year he secretly offered to film the president and speculated that he was unfit for the job he was doing.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in the Times is inaccurate.
What would we do if the new investigation of Brett Kavanaugh requested by the FBI was incomplete or inaccurate, or if he proved his innocence in the Supreme Court despite credible sexual assault charges and false testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the midterm elections for Congress to blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I believe that will not happen because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a logo of a swastika.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Dorance of the Rangers with an optimistic attitude towards the crash of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting the Rapid Vienna match on Thursday, and are therefore aware that after an untied match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a win over the Austrians will cement their position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Dorens, the midfielder who was hampered by a knee injury, was unable to appear in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to bigger achievements.
"That was a good point for us because 'Villarreal' is a good opponent", the 31-year-old said.
We entered the game believing we could accomplish something and came back with a winning score.
We might have given a little more in the end, but the outcome that was not resolved was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, and we gave our best in the second half and we were better.
We're having another big European night on Thursday.
I hope we get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we'll come back and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely a tough year given everything that happened, which was my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a positive factor about the venue.
The team's good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put the past season behind us and make it a success.
Women can't sleep at night because of this fear of retirement savings.
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the study conducted by Nationwide said they had discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not share your wishes with them in advance.
Work with your counselor and family and discuss where and how to get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to cover those expenses.
Your options for funding long-term care may include a traditional long-term care policy, a cash-based hybrid life insurance policy, which can help you cover expenses or secure your own insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Settle your legal documents: Avoid legal battles from the very beginning.
You can get a health care authority so you can empower a trusted person to oversee your health care and ensure that health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider authorizing your financial resources.
This way you would choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do so yourself.

A man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home from a trip.
The victim, aged about 40, was located in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officials described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British Summer Time) as an accidental act.
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are appealing to witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Paluu on Friday, officials said, with casualties expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, emergency responders cannot receive information from Donggala County, an area north of Palou that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palo.
Following are some key facts about Palo and Donggala, Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches for more than 300 kilometres (180 miles) of coastline in the northwestern part of Sulawesi Island.
The county, which represents an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
The Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency says that Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck and swept the western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years include:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the area near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mantawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached 10 meters [10 feet] and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focus earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing desolation and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause tsunamis, but over 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin was arrested on assault charges.
Pauline, 29, of Vasile, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a domestic violence report, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police officers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Paulin is in Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of parole if he pays a $500 fine, KTUU reported.
On Saturday he appeared in court, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked how he testified before the court, the network said.
Pauline faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Alaska Veterans Court is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, tampering with evidence of domestic violence and possession of a weapon under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son's violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died since the earthquake hit Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the area near Central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media is circulating videos showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for the Palo Beach Festival when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect in the New York terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saypov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare death sentence not carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck at the Home Depot in October to attack a bicycle lane on the West Side of lower Manhattan Highway and trample on pedestrians and cyclists who found him on the road.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will need to prove that Saipow intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, there is a possibility of a death sentence on both of these grounds of the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, which are typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of assault and motor vehicle destruction.
The attack required detailed planning and deliberation, prosecutors said, with Saipov's manner of carrying out it described as "grossly violent and distorted".
Sayfullo Habibulaevich Saipov caused, injured, damaged and lost the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleaves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erly, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho, the state's intention report said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since a death penalty case was prosecuted in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal case was executed in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saypov, born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also reported that he requested to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saifov, said they were obviously disappointed by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accept a guilty plea and serve life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saypov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A Tory party envoy says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today during the protest at the party conference promised to mobilize the People's Army.
Former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must feel the heat of Eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's MPs proposing that he be in charge of EU negotiations.
Conservative supporter Peter Bon at the Birmingham march said the UK would have been out of the EU by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing Ms May in terms of uniting her deeply divided members was highlighted by the anti-Brexit members of the Tori party who joined a special anti-Brexit protest being held in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to continue implementing the Checker's plan despite attacks by pro-Brexit faces, anti-Brexit faces and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue her efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force Eurosceptics and members of the Labour Party to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr. Bon told the pro-Brexit rally "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wanted to scrap the plan from the Checker's.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be involved and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would be out of the EU by now", he said.
The Wellingborough envoy added: "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the plan of the Chequers".
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: 'We have not fought world wars yet to be subservient.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bon rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate".
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Conservative and pro-Brexit party was also present at the march and told reporters: "I'm simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The plan of Checker's is not well received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well received by our party and our activists who are actually the ones who take to the streets and who owe our election victory.
Please abandon the Checker's plan and start listening to us.
In a message to Ms May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr. Farage told the assembly that politicians must feel the heat if they intend to pass on the decision that was made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he added: "I want to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country which has given us victory in Brexit and which will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit faces marched through Birmingham, before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group's meeting, a small number of activists showed up this weekend carrying banners reading "The Turks Against Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, was laughing at the Conservatives for the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference about the app the party was creating.
"These are people who tell us they can set up IT systems and all the technology needed for Canada plus, for borderless control, for borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to think hard about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll think about running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Massachusetts Democratic Party's representative was talking about her future during a city assembly in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, which was held using the format of a city council.
One of the presenters asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that included putting a woman at the top.
Arrested suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Sims from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims from the LSU team that occurred on Friday has been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m. eastern time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
"Weed Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, reports 247sports.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being present at the scene, possessing a weapon, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
As a 6'2" junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton closer to the world title after his team with its orders secured him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walter Botas qualified for Louis Hamilton on Saturday it became clear that the orders of the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
From the half-way point, Botas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton on the bench while defending his position in the first two rounds and invited Bethel to attack his teammate.
Bethel got in first and left Hamilton to deal with the turmoil at the end of the group, which was supposed to be a decisive factor.
Mercedes entered the box a lap later and came behind Bethel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action which forced the Ferrari driver to unwittingly leave the interior at his own free risk to stay aside after the double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round finished seventh.
He then led the majority of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered the boxing at round 44, but could not boost the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikonen came in fourth.
Today is a hard day because Walter did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman letting me through.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have their own pair in the race, Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasi Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at the West Virginia rally, the president did not directly reference Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were mean and ugly and dishonest.
"There's only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what's happening in the last few days in the Senate you can see anger, people who are angry and mean and reckless and dishonest", he said.
When you see the news and the leaks and they say, "Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
- Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you release this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you release the document?
Oh, no, I'm not.
I didn't publish it.
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... no, we didn't publish it, he added, imitating the senator.
A letter to Feinstein containing information about the charges against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford back in July, and it was published in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not publish her story", Feinstein told the committee, "The Hill publishes".
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I did what she asked.
But it seems the president doesn't believe her denial, so he was commenting on the same thing at the rally on Saturday: "I'll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use arguments to achieve their own ends.
They are determined to restore power by any means necessary.
You can see their wickedness, their mischief, they don't care who they hurt, who they need to kill to regain power and control, the president said as reported by Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for their loss in the Minor League Championship game on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants won the lead by two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowielier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney gained a lead for the hosts before Dwyer returned to lead the Giants.
Francois Boucher tied for Dundee ahead of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen to secure their victory with his two goals.
This was the third Minor League defeat of the season for Adam Kiffy's boys, who came back with a 2-1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides this season, with the Giants winning their previous three games.
Dwyer's lead came in the fourth minute, 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFall, whose addition was provided by David Rutherford while Bowielier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick start to the game, with Sullivan securing the home run lead with 13:10, before Matt Mercart assisted Cooney to a 15:16 mark.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Buschard returned with a powerful game and goal, with a score of 27:37.
Kawhi and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen for the first time secure the lead of Dundee in the late second period and he secured his team's victory halfway through the final period of the fifth period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game on Friday at home ground in Milton Keynes.
A flight controller died helping hundreds of people on a plane to escape the earthquake
A flight controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying hundreds of people to fly safely.
More than 800 people died and many disappeared after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong successive earthquakes continue to devastate the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But despite his colleagues avoiding saving his own life, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower at Muteara Sisi Al-Jufri airport in Palo Alto, which was constantly on the move.
He remained in his position to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft with flight number 6321 which was then on the runway would fly safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower the moment he thought the tower was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Johannes Syrait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia said his decision probably saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"This news broke our hearts", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to Donggala, Sigi and Butong cities is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many are not even accessible", said Sutopo agency spokesman Purvo Nugarho.
Waves reaching up to six meters devastated Palo, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Fast aid carries bodies every minute.
There's not enough clean water.
Minimum wage is looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is quick to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the national army: "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man has been reported missing after a plane crash in the lagoon.
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one person has gone missing after previously claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said they have not been able to locate the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials announced Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American traveler Bill Jans said the plane was flying very low.
"That's an extremely good job", said Jane's.
Jeans said he and the others managed to cross the water reaching halfway and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue by using a floating boat to bring people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none involved the airline Air Niugini.
Analyst determined the time frame of the night when the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors concluded by presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He pointed to the prosecution that he used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tallis to 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones indicating that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another misconception was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
Phone records show they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted Chambers' messages and calls, as well as her contact information from her phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is due to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to rule on the case later that day.
What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip hop trio wants to beat the negative attitude towards this genre by incorporating positive messages into their music.
Bristol-based The High Breed argue that hip-hop has moved away from its origins as music with political messages aimed at solving social problems.
They want to go back to its roots and popularize conscious hip-hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced their revival through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
New York nanny sues a married couple for being fired after sending a racist message
A New York nanny sues a married couple for being dismissed on discrimination grounds after mistakenly receiving a message from her mother complaining that she was still a black woman.
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually blackmail.
Lindsay Placebo-Flaxman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of work for new caregiver Giselle Morris, she learned she was black.
"The last one is a letter", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in the letter to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, and that twice.
After realizing what Placebo-Flaxman had actually done, feeling uncomfortable, she fired Ms. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing her job poorly and that she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines instead, the New York Post reports.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and seeking damages for the dismissal of $350 a day for six months, an engagement that would involve her living with her family, something she was originally committed to, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that these things shouldn't be done", she told the Post on Friday, adding that "I know it's discrimination".
The couple responded to the lawsuits as racist, saying that firing Ms. Morris was a reasonable move because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists, " her husband Joel Plasto told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to a person you have been indecent to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real.
Claiming the lawsuit constitutes extortion, Plasto said his wife gave birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in a very difficult situation.
You're going to attack someone in that situation?
That's not exactly what the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the social media couple, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington fear that readers will not be able to connect with the talking bear, the new letter reveals.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: "It's really hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very interesting that we now know all this about the huge success of Paddington.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the book from a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was both bitter and sweet after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of our family, she adds that her father felt silent pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and didn't want to be fooled at all", she said.
But because you felt Paddington so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you're proud of him even though success doesn't come from you.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was a creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was on her deathbed, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz.
Then Nad called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly diminished and they left her system.
She died early, which meant all her systems were giving up.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this was happening.
I could not scream, cry, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay home.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I nodded my head, and the tears stopped.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immeasurable compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her.
Sad women put cards on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries put up cards on Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Leeds, says that her son had great potential as a chef, as did an infectious smile.
Everyone remembered him for his smile.
People always said his smile could light up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died because it was a really dark place.
His brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid that it will have a consequential effect".
Mrs. Davis makes these cards to let people know that there are people out there that they can turn to and talk to, even if they're a friend.
Don't sit quietly, you have to start talking.
Mrs. Humphries, who is a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost her partner Mark to whom she was married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, so he didn't say anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of the Christmas day when the children opened their presents, and he didn't look them in the eye at all and make any contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma for all of them, but they had to find a way through it:
It leaves us broken.
But we must go on and fight.

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain since the FBI began its investigation.
'I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was asking for, namely a limited-time, limited-scale investigation, we might be able to achieve a little unity,' Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be dissolved in the context of the entrenched guerrilla situation.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is due solely to timing.
The midterm elections are due to be held in just a few weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to face failure, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush is calling the Senators, lobbying to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There's going to be a vote in the Senate where there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats at the moment.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the unresolved result and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has declined under Kim's leadership.
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Beong-seog, citing data from the Ministry of South Korean Reunification said that there were 1,127 border crossings last year compared to 2011 when there were 2,706.
Mr. Park said stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on people smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most North Korean refugees eventually gain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where the longest border with North Korea is located and which can be easily crossed compared to the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss topics focused on the stalemate of denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards achieving the goal - the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed the US sanctions on stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm first", Mr. Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The House minority leader called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that given his temperament he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted like that, they would call her hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his introduction, sometimes even yelling and licking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation" organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is evidence that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court because he has been shown to be biased against Democrats.
"I think she disqualifies herself with those statements and the way she attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"I'll say this: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only not fit to serve on the Supreme Court, but he's also not fit to serve on the court where he's currently in office", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible verdicts that Kavanaugh would bring against the Affordable Care Act or Roy v. Wade, because he was considered to be a subject of conservative justice.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to come to court and expect us to say, 'That's really great, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women should use it too.
It's really sharp criticism, months and years of anger gathering, which she can't free herself from without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Statham told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do I?
She went on, "I was a lot helped by a woman who was doing a job somewhere, and she told me that she cried when she was angry, but she was able to develop her technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you.
And then she keeps crying.
I think that's brilliant.
Tears are allowed as a blown-out valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office is when I once started crying in unrelenting anger and an elderly woman, a cold manager who I always had a certain fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you crying", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll enjoy the fact that they've been able to reach out to you.
Patricia Schröder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schröder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not consider running for president.
"That wasn't a well-thought-out decision", he told me 30 years later through laughter.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs".
Given the fact that the campaign was launched a long time ago, she didn't have enough funds, so she promised not to enter the race unless we raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, would give her only $250.
'Do they think there should be a discount for me?' she wondered.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, that is, gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism, she started crying.
"If you'd seen me, you'd probably think I had a nervous breakdown", Mrs. Schröder recalls the media's reaction to the incident.
You'll think that Clinics is my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.

How the trade war between the US and China could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire with the start of the US-China trade war was daunting, and while the battle is far from over, the conflict between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, gave his first warning earlier this year by taxing China's key exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation escalated significantly during this week with the introduction of new tariffs on US$200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods coming into the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly returned in kind, or recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth US$60 billion.
China has promised to give back to the United States with equal measure, and it's unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give up anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting its demands, but public bow to the United States would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing does well, the pressures of the US trade war could result in positive support for China in the long run as it will reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for a sharp economic downturn in either country is far more dangerous than previously determined by observers", said Abigail Grace, a research associate focusing on Asia at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country devastated by the long war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'alem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
Now all the conditions are provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alem said the Syrian regime welcomes aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe has achieved a significant victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe defeated Team USA at the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six straight European titles and has not won the European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the lead after the team of Danish captain Thomas Björn scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who faced difficulties throughout most of the tournament, threw the ball into the water in his first hole-in-one at the par-3 on the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5-4 to the lowest-ranked player on the European team, Torbjörn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the highest-ranked player in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have been the last Ryder Cup player.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European to win the most tournament titles with 25.5 points scored during his career.
I don't usually cry, but I can't stop today.
This year has been really hard.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I'm happy I could help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He now gives up the place to his compatriot John Ram, who in a week one-on-one defeated Tiger Woods, the American golf legend, by a score of 2:1.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching it as a game", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an incredible statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, ranking him behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the weekend trying to focus on the low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk after his team's disappointing game said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
At one point this morning we put a strain on the European team.
We fought.
- He's down for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the Professional Golfers Association of America and our Ryder Cup committee and move on.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
We've been elevated.
New information on the red tide: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows overall declines in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the Commission, conditions of uneven algae degradation have been observed in the area of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide, a consequence of the red algae's erosion, runs for about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas County to southern Lee County.
Red-bordered specimens can also be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but the numbers are still smaller than last week.
A red streak has also been seen in Pasco County.
During the past week, the following concentrations have been observed: average concentrations in or on the coast of Pinellas County, low to high concentrations on the coast of Hillsborough County, common to high concentrations in or on the coast of Sarasota County, common to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, common to high concentrations in or on the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation continue to occur.
No reported cases of respiratory irritation in Northwest Florida during the past week.
