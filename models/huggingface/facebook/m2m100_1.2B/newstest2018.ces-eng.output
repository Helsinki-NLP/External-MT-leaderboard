Civil Rights Movement Launches Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Benefit of Color People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri on the basis of the state’s discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
“The NAACP Travel Recommendation for Missouri, effective from August 28, 2017, calls on African American travellers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay more attention when traveling across the state due to a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently taking place across the state,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step on the basis of current Missouri laws, which make it harder to defend racist-motivated acts in court, as well as as the actions of law enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police just because of their skin color, they are attacked or killed,” said Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP for Missouri.
“We have received the most complaints so far.
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the United States.
The incidents the organization cited included racially motivated abuse of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he got gasoline on his way across the state and was arrested by police without being charged with committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement by the Missouri Supreme Prosecutor’s Office, which states that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared – they should carry money with them for a possible deposit or warn their relatives that they are about to travel through the state.”
According to the current figures of the FBI program for reporting hate crimes, there were 100 cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, making the state 16th among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows government officials to detain people on the basis of violations of this law, which, according to the ACLU, aims to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
She was killed by a chef.
After 12 years, she has no peace.
Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
The Croydon girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie in a restaurant where she worked.
The victim and the murderer had sex and smoked marijuana, then killed her.
The murderer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful criminal investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for murdering and raping model Sally.
He admitted in court only to the assault on the teenager and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police arrested him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend, Lewis Sprotson, fought a fateful night.
The murderer said, "He was seriously angry and after his attack the girl started screaming."
“It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver,” he said lying.
According to his testimony, the girl had to defend herself, if she could, but in vain.
Lewis struck her on the street.
Dixie’s version was proved to be a lie and accused him.
After the confession, Dixie spoke about his arousal and appetite for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drank alcohol and took cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and placed her hand over her mouth," Linda said.
Twelve years later, the family is faced with further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the last six months.
In freedom there are so cruel people who dig these graves.
“So our daughter is no longer there,” the mirror mother of the deceased girl Linda told the news about the disappearance of the urn with ashes.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
“The Czechs are neither prudent nor conservative,” says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic tools.
It was designed by Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started unobtrusively, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of unusual vibrators.
"Various moles and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me over lunch.
His friend and one companion decided to work with the German manufacturer of design erotic tools Fun Factory, which Martin was interested in, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to engage in another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he operates the Intimity boutique in the Prague Benedict Street, where he sells erotic supplies in the way luxury bags or shoes are commonly offered.
And why not?
They are also design objects.
That’s what you’re talking about at lunch, right?
Don’t be such puritans!
It was the Fun Factory store in Berlin, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that inspired the Intimity boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than what everyone is used to here.
No covered outlets, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in a perfume.
Martin and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka began to consider how to take the Prague store, where it should be and how it should be named.
The name was liked by both.
“It’s intimate and it’s also, I can say, gentle,” he says.
It was followed by the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went parallel to various visualizations of the interior.
Eventually, the variant won, which spread the store into a garden of delight and a bedroom dominated by the bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar Štěpánová from FormaFatal Studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn’t seem perfect because he wasn’t on the main street, but thanks to that, he sat down with the name Intimity.
It is intimate.
It is in the street next to the main one, so no one is bothering customers," says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed to enter such a business at all.
When I entered the Intimity boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
In addition, I didn’t even feel like I’d go to an erotic appliance store.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female servant in the store, not being shy about asking for help does not mean that the male foot is not welcome here.
Most men come here to buy gifts for their friends.
"Men usually don't know the right size and choose a larger one," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
Those are those prejudices, those experienced clichés that women need some great help, and that’s not true.
So a man in good faith chooses a unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men prefer black clothes, while women tend to wear pink.
The bestseller is a product called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face it must be clear that I don’t know which one is beating because Martin immediately explains how it works.
This is a clitoris stimulator.
There is an adolescent need in me to admire the serious tone with which the interpretation is being given to me.
As if it did not understand.
In fact, it does not understand.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
I did not think he would be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care that women began to become more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a We-Vibe vibrator for couples.
He completely overthrew the taboo that can persist in some men, and that in erotic aid they see competition.
“There are different options,” he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
In a love relationship, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain disadvantage is the category of attached vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, although they use them only externally.
In Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
Maybe it should be taken a little differently.
The question is what to offer men,” Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is primarily a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It doesn’t look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
A lot of attention is paid to functionality and experience during use.
In Japan it is completely different.
It arouses amazement in me.
I thought Japanese women would have a lot to do with erotic help.
“That’s the internet reality,” I explained.
The usual is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic tools are more associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just for the curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity boutique, sells worldwide, still accounts for approximately half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not very sensitive.
On the contrary, we are a very friendly nation.
Unlike other countries such as Poland and Italy.
The typical client of the store is between 35 and 50 years old and "has already had some experience with both sexual life and some utilities.
She will come for something nice, more quality, which would complement her partnership life, or for herself."To return, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeňek Šebelka care so that they convince each product if it is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to go into specialties such as bondage and latex, because we do not have room for it, but it is not suitable here.
Such things could dissuade those we are trying to target.
There are people who have always been embarrassed to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would hit them.
A lot of the products displayed on the shelves are really pleasant.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever award-winning was the aforementioned sea horse "and this triggered a change in the entire industry.
They began to refrain from cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-friendly materials, they began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that behind the designs of some are Czechs, namely the popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say that I am quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy those design items Whoop.de.doo from Anna Marešová, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for the Venus Balls by Anna Marešová.
She did a really huge job by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present – that erotic tools can be done differently, beautifully, with a story.
Annie’s story began as a school work.
Now it is a finished product, which is also manufactured here.
I wanted to have the manufacturing process under control and also wanted to know what materials and how the Whoop.de.doo products are made from.
Because it is not a bulk production, but a small series, it is definitely more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I’m going a little against the current, but I think it’s important to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It might well happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna describes the situation to me later, who and Martin agree that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or rejecting attitude.
Most people are confused.
Currently, Anna Marešová has a vibrator in the offer, on which you can make a personal message, and this year she also plans to make her own lubricating gel.
In the coming year, there will be more vibration eggs and other news.
Healthy Sex Limits
I wonder where the boundaries of what is right are.
Is there anything that Martin doesn’t want to do?
It is very difficult to define.
What seems normal to one, may seem completely unusual to another, so we are more determined by the range of brand manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a final question: What was the craziest request they received?
Just a week ago, an email came in, in which a lady asked for a masturbation tool for her friend with a nature of twenty-eight centimeters long.
So we had to write that, unfortunately, we have nothing like that.
The question still remains, hasn’t anyone made a joke with us,” Martin measures me with a suspicious look.
This also happens from time to time...
Injury to Karla Gotta.
Two cancers of Alzheimer’s.
His friend, Karel Štědrý, is struggling with a serious illness.
Karla Gotta’s best friend is struggling with a disease that will steal people all their memories.
“Yes, it’s unfortunately true,” the singer confirmed the sad news.
I know about my illness, and so far I am quite able to cope with it.
“I’m taking medicines that have the accompanying phenomena of the disease slowed down,” he added, thanking the loved ones for their support.
The whole family gathered together to make life easier for Charles.
Wife Eva tries to be at home, as much as possible, the daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Teresa come to the house of her father in the White Mountain, caring for the son Karel called Karlas.
He fought with cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him in his difficult treatment.
He has undergone 60 chemotherapies.
He was able to return to work after them and to the tennis court and to the ski slopes.
"I have been predicted by the astrologer that I will be here by the age of ninety," said Karel Blesku.
He is a warrior.
He still wants to sing.
“I repeat the words of the songs all the time so that I can’t forget them,” Karel admitted.
Actress Květa Fialová is currently struggling with the same disease.
Do you have an Alzheimer’s patient in your family?

Chile's parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the U.S.
In Chile, abortion is still prohibited for medical reasons.
“I regret that lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been debating in parliament for more than two years,” said Isabel Allende.
Chile’s Constitutional Court has 10 members and is expected to have a new president by the end of August, which is close to the opposition.
The abortion ban, initiated by President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violated the right of an unborn child to life.
MEPs postponed voting on the bill last month until it was reviewed by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the proposal was approved by the Senate and then again approved by the Senate.
According to the new legislation, abortion should cease to be a crime in three cases: if the life of the woman is in danger, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before women were granted the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the office of president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where abortion is prohibited.
Other countries include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now in prison for abortion and are serving up to 30 years in prison.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was spontaneous abortion, which the court described as murder.
Is there anything sacred?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
A clear sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could talk about it just as well as everyone else – see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, was sure to know what he was heading for when, during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on presidential proposals to drastically limit legal immigration, he set his symbolic seckle onto the Statue of Liberty.
It is worth adding that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this, the crowd of cruise ship owners and the imitators of the Statue of Liberty would blame him.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that a plaque with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the base in 1903, only 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller said, “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that has been added to the base, and you refer to, is not part of it.”
Miller is actually right, but as he said, this is not history.
These are, above all, the striking words of Emmy Lazarus, which resonate with modern times – inviting not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: “Let me come, whoever falls, whoever is poor, who can barely breathe, who is a poor worm in the midst of full cities.”
And it is precisely in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of a vast political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict over the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a poster with poetry on the base of the statue, knew well enough that she was putting herself into a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the connection between the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The merger of a poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wing followers have long sought to reverse this meaning.
Known commentator Rush Limbaugh – John the Baptist on Trump’s rise to power – argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually take anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He takes the fireplace of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The march does not light the way to the United States.”
Strangely, Limbaugh comes across an important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the perspective of an exhausted and damned traveler who often, after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in the heart to a new land.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And this is, of course, a perspective that Miller or Trump will definitely not recognize.
Their façade is not to illuminate the way, but to stir up hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish British team members
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletic Federation Director Neil Black said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be “a huge contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 World Cup in London, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that “something special is happening” in Scotland and that British athletics could learn from the Scots.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt – we’re going to work on it,” Black said.
“I spoke to people from the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they did.
The representatives of Scottish athletics think it has to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People on the streets also think so.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will strive for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was elected captain of the team.
“Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,” Black said.
Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a feeling of tremendous pride and motivation.
The passion and unhidden feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m obstacle race at her fifth world championship, said it was “unbelievable” that there are 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
She has set five British and two European records in the past year.
He will take part in the 1500m and 5000m races.
Another great Scotlander is Chris O'Hare, who runs the 1500m track this season, winning the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish team member Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team said she was “very proud” of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues got into the team, but in many cases they will also attack to participate in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about being the captain of the team is that I was elected by the other members of the team.It was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was elected by the members of the team is a pleasure,” she added.
“I’m very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It shows where I have moved.
They are athletes who will think about leading places on the stage.
What about my opening speech?
I think she succeeded.
We can be proud of this year’s championship because it’s on the ground.
It is important to take advantage of the support of our domestic fans and rejoice at the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I’ve got a second chance to race and I’ll enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office unless you can’t tolerate criticism from voters
My father knew of his criticism.
Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
This criticism did not leave him cold.
He did not try to silence criticism.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and fools and dumb people will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland’s governor, Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was sued this week by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The governor’s staff rejected the lawsuit as unfounded and many “who is interested” opinions appeared on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” said a lot of users.
Yet it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic country, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It can boast the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan is not awkward.
As it can be seen, the state is governed with confidence by itself and strictly follows its principles.
He also turned out to be proficient in using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his voters—not even the publication of his first nude-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy is an exception.
Blocking people who come to the governor’s website – which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by its employees paid from taxpayers’ money – is useless and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor by saying that the blocking of comments took place from the position of moderation.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers, or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post confessed several real people to whom posts were deleted.
And that’s exactly what they are—real people speaking to their chosen leaders; teachers, entrepreneurs, and pastors, no trolls.
As everyone stated, their comments were polite and respectful, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi lawyer Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I politely noted that I am disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the Washington Post comment section.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are marked by some people for promoting so-called collective efforts, instead of being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called “centric spam interest” would probably be called “defense.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require staff to be sent to the streets to collect and burn all the copies of criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing lawsuits by Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
According to District Judge James C. Cacheris, the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors chairwoman violated the First Amendment in Alexandria by blocking one of her voters’ access to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
At the time of Washington, the low cost of postal charges had virtually the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as a leader was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those times, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People, writing under pseudonyms like “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius”, wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people within the online project Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have accumulated in his office criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
A true leader has to accept it.
The Czechs have quickly taken advantage of free roaming, consuming more data abroad than at home.
In foreign countries, Czechs consume more of their tariffs than they do at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season dominates Croatia.
On holiday, on the other hand, they have more time to browse the web, under the sunshine, in addition, they mostly do not have the possibility to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and a smart phone in hand.
This is how a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, the majority of Czech travellers abroad have more data available within a flat rate than at home.
Therefore, it is not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum number of people travels over the winter, data consumption has increased 50 times this summer.
On the second place in the list of consumed data, Italy was then placed.
Most of the minutes the Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go to work and during the summer.
According to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, 800,000 Czechs visit Croatia annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
People here, however, exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
“The transfer of data would fit tens of millions of photos,” said Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users move in neighbouring countries.
The first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking tourism and an active holiday, for which we do not have so much time to browse the internet.
“Through Austria, the Czechs are heading to the Adriatic,” explained Cieslar.
While data operators have seen high year-on-year growth following the release of roaming charges, the growth in telephony is much lower.
The number of minutes called on roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany is dominant over other countries.
"Roaming calls are used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golf player Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative district of East Lothian over the next three days, which is hosting the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, succumbed to Paul Eales last year on his way to the final at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course. This year he will serve as the ambassador of the tournament in the name of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” said Rafferty.
“The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Eales will be defending the championship title for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
“I feel good about it,” said the southport golf player.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when the win meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr has joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th anniversary this year.
This event will be his first participation from the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I always like to play at home,” Orr said about Helensburg.
“You want to succeed and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoy playing again and I think I’m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”
The three players will also be joined by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance to the tournament is free. Parking fee is £5 per car with one passenger and £10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei is cooking dinner, she doesn’t use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses the pan.
In her wooden cottage, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, take out the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground – the house is not furnished – where she also performs her daily tasks, such as washing clothes in muddy water from a nearby well.
In a room without a roof, the toilet is filled.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields to cultivate.
Polygamy is common.
Working until late at night is dangerous: most men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
“After five in the afternoon, no one is allowed to wander around the village,” says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by public hand lifting before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Yakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city that you can get to it after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabira, and then a five-hour stomach swirling ride.
Public transportation does not work here.
The city, with 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, wool-plated roofs in shades of gray and rust.
Very few Indonesians, not least journalists, visited this place, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that is not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing those dresses,” Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-plated turban, a dark shirt, and a shiny dress.
“We used to wear only leaves.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and the child mortality and literacy rate is one of the worst in Asia.
It is also the country of gold.
The largest and most lucrative gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, USA, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced gold and copper worth $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua supports timber mining worth an estimated $78 billion.
This wealth, however, is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 investigation by the New York Times revealed that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for an officer.
Papuans calling for self-government are threatening this golden goose and are therefore harshly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in Papua’s tribal area during the 1970s were equal to genocide, the Asian Commission for Human Rights said.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — especially popular in rape and electricity execution — and brutal repression of peaceful protesters, according to another report.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources attracted colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christian, but demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura province for work.
“The indigenous people of Papua—mama-mama (women)—so lost their jobs.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, pledged to address inequalities and violations of rights in his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured and his trip to the presidential palace in Jakarta 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he will hear our call for justice,” You said.
In fact, just two months after Jakowi’s October inauguration, Paniai experienced a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a camp fire in the city of Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles emerged from the middle of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the blasphemy and tone he had spoken and later returned with four other soldiers, the local parish priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunk state pursued a group of children and beat them with their weapons, citing victims and witnesses.
One of the soldiers then shot a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later someone set fire to the nearby election commission building and the next day things escalated.
Around 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came up with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which they run in a circle and mimic the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Many protesters threw stones at the buildings.
With escalating tensions, the soldiers were ordered by radio: “If the crowd attempts to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” according to the weekly TIME in an official document, the content of which was never published in local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Enarotali Kego Koto district, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one ignored his words.
“When I turned, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME on the veranda of his painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who was the shooter, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people around and there were a lot of shootings,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME.
“I saw him dead... I kissed him.”
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only “securing” the station that was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said in 2015.
“It’s a question of life and death.”
Human Rights Watch said five protesters were killed and many were injured.
The news of the murder broke through the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his understanding to the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
“I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never be repeated,” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would establish an out-of-court mechanism to resolve violent acts in the past.
Immediately excuses began to appear.
“Most violent acts have taken place long ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task,” he said.
In an interview with TIME in Jakarta on June 5, Wiranto said he had no plans to take any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought to court.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than 1,000 deaths during the independent elections in East Timor in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have been settled so far, including the incident in Pania.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claim with mistrust.
“In the last three years I’ve been interviewed four times, but I haven’t heard anything so far,” Yohanes said.
“I am tired.”
A few years later, he still lives in fear.
“I’m afraid,” he says.
“I’m afraid that the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me.”
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many inhabitants of Paniai who are afraid of the incident to speak.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me,” he said.
The shooting has not stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The clash, in which one person died and 17 others were injured, occurred between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting the unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the building.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing stones at the members and the response was a warning shot.
Local residents, however, claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation,” Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded, told TIME.
“I haven’t gone out of the house for two days.”
The Deiyaisk Parliament called for the punishment of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous people of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that protects the rights of the Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders come from Paniai. These include Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the military in recent years has arbitrarily arrested and detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of “securing national sovereignty.”
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the inhabitants of Papuai as “a tragic and forgotten place”.
Oil to the fire brings poverty.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is equally inaccessible.
The inhabitants grow their foods: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian Rupee (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow to the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to start a business.
“Young people are moving out of villages due to a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Because of the isolation, Papua province is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists.
Earlier this year, two French journalists, Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp, were expelled from Papua for “lack of cooperation with the authorities,” all despite the fact that they were given such a rare permit to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and transparency and development.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious eastern regions of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa non-recognition and blacklisting," he said.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on the Indonesian in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread acts of violence” in Papua, including the shooting in Pania.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and the media is free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the involvement of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people shouted the slogan “we want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Another election is scheduled in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papuan people say they will not vote for Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbery army - are rolling in poverty, poor education, and the health system.
Gobai argues that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the rest of the Papuans, consider their vote a “debt” to be paid back to Jokowi.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims, the shootings continued the final symbolic act of resistance: they buried the bodies of the victims on the plot opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, it will at least not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said with his head down.
“What can we do?”
The French Navy has seized a massive shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment went to Australia.
The four crew members of the ship were arrested, probably from Lithuania and Latvia.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was pulled by police to a port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were going, and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate".
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large amounts of drugs heading to Australia,” Col Blanch, the chief executive of the agency, said.
The drugs were destroyed this week in Noumée.
Australia is an attractive destination for drug smugglers.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current situation is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, which attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem can be in the homes for seniors, the solution, according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavly Mádlová, could be infusion of a saline solution, which is mixed with a thin needle under the skin.
For now, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so older people generally take in less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two liters should be drunk.
“But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem,” she added.
There are often no doctors at home for the elderly.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
“I think it should also be gradually introduced there so they can get subcutaneous infusions,” she said.
In one day, up to two half-litre bottles of salt can be supplied to the elderly.
Lack of fluids can cause illness, headache and decreased performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can result in a stroke.
Blood will thicken and clog the vessel in the brain, there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Lying patients should not be covered with a pearl, maximum cotton plaid.
A problem can also be single-use blades.
“It’s more demanding from a nurse’s point of view, but the ideal would be to occasionally uncover the patient and let the skin wind out,” she said.
The Torch in Dubai has burned for the second time.
In Dubai on Friday, one of the world’s largest residential skyscrapers was in flames. firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337 meters high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire in the last two years in this high-rise building, which bears the proper name The Torch.
All inhabitants of the building were evacuated and no people were injured.
“We were sleeping and we were awakened by an alarm.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor,” Geroge, one of the residents of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around four o’clock in the morning (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing replacement accommodation for affected residents.
The incident could once again spark discussion about the safety of materials used to cover high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015 showed that the most damaged layers and external panels used for decoration or insulation were damaged.
British police said the insulation and coating system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in the June fire that killed 80 people.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carries banned items on board an airplane.
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously carried banned items through the U.S. Governmental Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoint on board the aircraft.
Less than one percent of passengers said they had discovered late that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. – and responded to by more than 1,000 respondents – showed that younger passengers are more likely to breach the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to trying to consciously travel with an object that is banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flight hours compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
The most common items that escaped TSA’s attention include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents deliberately carried a sharp object over the guard, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men also admitted that they deliberately carried illegal drugs on board the aircraft.
The company said it had conducted research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally carried unauthorized items through airport checks and how many did so intentionally.
It is no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized objects – whether consciously or unconsciously – travel by plane very often.
As the company has stressed, TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know what fluids and in what quantities they can carry onto the plane.
It is therefore not surprising that the TSA seized the largest amount of just banned fluid.
For some time, people thought that TSA would treat books in the same way as smuggled goods.
Fluids are allowed on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA Director Scott Pruitt on Delaying Obama Administration’s Planned Emissions Reduction Directives
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief Scott Pruitt withdrew his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan and responded to the needs of state environmental regulators more quickly than previous governments.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal filed against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
The deadline was set to October 1, when countries should start implementing the 2015 Regulation on the reduction of ground ozone levels.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma State Attorney General before President Donald Trump took over as EPA chief, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
The sudden Wednesday turnaround is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the EPA executive exceeded its authority in an attempt to delay the inclusion of the Obama administration’s plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of the ozone standards and reinforced the EPA’s commitment to cooperate with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
“During the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans,” Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation by means of court litigation and we take compliance with the deadline seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
The EPA statement, however, states that Pruitt may at some point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulations “are based on sound policies and the most accessible information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a wider revision of ozone rules.
The White House budget, approved last month, aims to postpone the implementation of 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow under legal pressure.
“The turn in the EPA’s views – following our court trial – is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman added.
To New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground ozone is created when common harmful substances discharged by automobiles, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are grateful for Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure we need to put on changing the thinking of responsible people and protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biodiversity.
“We must continue to fight the ideological drive of the Trump administration, which seeks to help polluters and special interests.”
He swallowed a man with acid, but he is not dangerous.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one point you are at home with your family and you laugh, at the other you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
The worst part is that you can do nothing about it.
A similar fate was encountered by Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was polluted with acid by an unknown attacker, who was eventually acquitted of guilt.
This is by Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros.
Andreas got up to open.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door to deliver Christmas presents to his family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man, whom he had never seen in his life, immediately, without warning, poured acid into it, saying, “This is for you, friend.”
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes crumbled on me like nothing and I only felt incredible pain in my skin,” Andreas said.
His family quickly transported him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Of the ninety percent, the face was affected, which the doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of the eyelids.
It’s probably the most painful thing I’ve experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his suffering.
Today, Christopheros has done twelve operations, which are far from the last.
The injuries suffered by acid attacks may require hundreds of surgeries and years of healing, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after challenging and long-term treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and struggle with deformation and deformation for a lifetime,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure that an unknown man must have confused him with someone.
The perpetrator believed he wanted to take revenge on a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the case thoroughly and then tracked out the attacker.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the amazement of Christopheros’s family fundamentally changed.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not seen as a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the last few years, the number of corrosive substances attacks has increased significantly.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs said it plans to set new guidelines for prosecutors regarding the classification of corrosive substances.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
However, the victims of such attacks do not give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often available in different stores because they are different cleaning products.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Service, the 80-story building was evacuated on time and no one was injured.
A Dubai police spokesman said the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to some residents, it was the opposite.
“It started on the 67th floor, so they told us,” one of the tenants said.
Also, according to another tenant quoted by Reuters, the fire erupted on the highest floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept .
We woke up, people were screaming.
“We ran down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor,” George described the events.
Another witness told CNN that the fires hit about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when the burning parts of the building fell on them.
About two hours later, the fire was managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
Witnesses said there was a collapse in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are approximately 680 apartments in the building.
No one was injured, as people were evacuated in a timely manner.
The Torch was built in 2011 and was the tallest residential building in the world at 352 meters.
The record was set by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He did not win anyway.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Serra, the sample of the 23-year-old Ippolita contained a varied collection of illegal drugs, ranging from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson’s disease and anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
The bodybuilder is now facing a four-year suspension and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, the Italian rugby player Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was the previous record number of sportsmen caught.
The three-degree player began taking steroids a year earlier, according to his words, when he fell away from bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in Czech Republic.
She hugged her ex-lover.
Lucka Vondráčková has barely entered the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one wheel.
It also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she had fallen into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouhý, with whom she had lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already longed for a family.
Lucia was only 19 at the time and she didn’t want to hang her career on a nail.
They separated, but friends remained to this day.
They also spoke at a press conference, where they met for a long time.
Both of them coincided in the blue color.
At first they didn’t pay attention to each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal’s jokes, until she hit her stomach.
They hugged each other and posed to the photographers.
Their meeting, however, was not a coincidence, because they will play together a loving couple in the new Primy series Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in Britain for preparing an attack.
A British court on Thursday sentenced to life imprisonment four members of an Islamist group called the Three Musketeers who, according to the prosecutor’s office, planned a terrorist attack on police and the army.
Four men, two of whom participated in a training camp in Pakistan and were previously convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
The authorities thought he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially-finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions meaning "unbelievers" in Arabic, and a pistol layout.
The incident occurred when a MI5 intelligence agent was installing a surveillance device in the vehicle.
“Recent assassinations showed the horror the defendants could have caused if they were not stopped,” said Sue Hemming, a deputy prosecutor.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 years can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, the men declared that they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by the MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the accused’s claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
It was 38.3 degrees Celsius.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Strážnica na Hodonínsku, it surpassed Thursday, which thus became the hitherto warmest day of this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
Unfortunately, there were no record temperatures on Thursday.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations over 30 years old were broken or balanced.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measurement stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, on Thursday, the temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica, Břeclavsk, Thursday’s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of the degree, and in Pohořelice, Brněnsk, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013.
It was 10 degrees lower in the west.
High temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia on Thursday.
After Strážnica, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
In the western and northwestern Czech Republic, for example, the highest temperatures for Thursday were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
“The temperatures started to rise there until later in the afternoon,” meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually resonate and more heavy rains may occur on Sunday.
However, high temperatures will remain in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions of dollars due to its visa policy.
For decades, China has tried to exercise its influence without the use of force.
It spends $10 billion annually on supporting language schools and building universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry to foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing that.
The state media speaks of a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, with about 80 percent of tourists coming to China from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is caused, among other things, by the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world’s most populous country, economics professor at Beijing University Christopher Balding in an article for Bloomberg.
One example of this is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free visits to China, while citizens of the other countries need to obtain a visa in advance.
Therefore, Chinese officials in the United States have crowds comparable to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs $140 but if you don’t want to wait for hours in line, you’ll have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic obstacles.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s GDP and lives in less than one percent of the total population, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often deepens the problem itself by using tourism to its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China in the spring restricted shipping to South Korea as part of a crackdown around South Korea’s missile defense system, the South Koreans paid for it and avoided China.
In May, the number of visitors fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan grew by 85 percent.
This affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the U.S. Federal Reserve, Chinese foreign travel could have left China for as much as $190 billion, while China earns about $35 billion a year from selling its currency to arrival tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a tourism deficit of $217 billion last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s total commodity trade surplus.
A small number of tourists thus inflict a very painful blow on a country that anxiously prevents the outflow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many parts of China, no one has heard about immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than one million foreigners living in China.
There are several different cities in the United States.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has a double.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants typically revitalize economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You can hardly find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is the simplification of the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and streamline the procedures for issuing visas.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the zoo there are deadly poisonous reptiles.
Plzeňské Kraljevstvo jedu can enjoy the offspring of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will only see all nine newly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
“The length is also rising,” said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The offspring of the other two species, the mortar and the red cobra, will gain strength in the garden's breeding ground.
We can’t say when people will see them.
“We don’t want to lose them,” said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian death-bearers are descendants of a breeding couple originating from a population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the death carrier from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care it is necessary for the death carrier to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
A hundred percent success was accompanied by the African swallowing cobra red.
A couple in the Zoo of Plzeň laid out four eggs of a total of four puppies.
“The incubation lasted 65 days,” Vobruba added.
In the wild, this species spreads poison on its victims up to a distance of four meters.
This can lead to permanent blindness.
The young of all three species are fed by mice in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, the young are still expected to lie out of the black mambas, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unchecked transcript of the telephone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The U.S. President accused him of publicly condemning the building of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like this in the press.”
During his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and said he would pay for it by Mexico.
A transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of opinions.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. deal on overseeing refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid" and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which was made under President Obama - he would look like a "drogged" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the U.S.
Trump told Turnbull, “This is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk has testified to the prosecutor’s office over Smolensk.
“He has something to fear,” said Mr. Tusk’s brother, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, chairman of the ruling PiS Law and Justice party.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczynski will not scare me," Tusk said, telling the country's current leadership that they are trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When he left the headquarters of the prosecutor's office, Tusk was waiting for a crowd that scandalized Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he has a clean conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not scare me."
He says he does not blame the prosecutors for anything, but he does not doubt that justice has to serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against rivals, opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was interrogated for the second time.
The former prime minister was interrogated at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time he was to be interrogated for mistakes in the autopsy of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies were replaced in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open the coffers and there must have been some reasons for this.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk someone very important in the EU," Kaczynski said.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would destroy Tusk’s chances of gaining the most important chair in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczynski said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take this into account.
Tusk was interrogated by the prosecutor's office for eight hours on April 19.
He did not testify as a suspect, but as a witness.
However, many saw his calls for interrogation as part of the obvious attempt by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political opponent by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Attorney General.
The call for interrogation came shortly after Tusk was elected as head of the European Council, which Kaczynski tried diligently but in vain to prevent, among other things during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo protested against the extension of Tusk’s mandate.
Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has also been arrested.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to re-vot the composition of the parliament from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This is due to a regulation that regulates the delivery of voting tickets abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared the update, which is currently under review.
Ten thousand Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed," the report said.
The decree contains two annexes, of which the first lists the representative offices to which paper voting tickets are supplied.
This group of authorities includes representations of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive voting tickets in the press version.
The list changes with the decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed.
The Czech Republic also canceled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no election at the consulate in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 due to the war in eastern Ukraine.
The embassy is located in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, Senegal, and Lusace, Zambia.
In Asia, the Czech Republic since the last parliamentary elections has expanded its representation with a general consulate in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of China's province of S'Chuan.
Voting tickets will also be available to registered voters at Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad had the opportunity to elect members in the polling stations at representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall draw the county for which candidates are voted abroad.
For the first time, it was in 2002, when the South Moravia candidates were selected.
In the next two elections, Czechs voted abroad among South Czech candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the city was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, approximately 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700 people, four years later there were 8,222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters went to the embassies.
Massacre at Moore's Ford Bridge: Activists commemorate racist lynching
The Mercury Ford of 1948 passed by watching the inhabitants of Monroe, Georgia and crawled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver reached the bridge, a group of white men with guns stopped him.
The leader of the group – a middle-aged man in a striped suit – long pulled out of a cigarette and stared at the front glass of the car.
The passengers inside trembled of fear.
“We want that n... and Roger!” cried the man.
“Bring him to me!”
The silence is interrupted by the scream of a young black man who is pulled out of the passenger’s seat.
Fortunately, this scene is merely a reconstruction of the events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws over “Roger’s” neck, the audience breathes out of excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have been returning to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has yet been convicted of the murders.
“It’s strange that not a single person has been arrested in all those years – even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction of the event.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event represents a dramatic challenge to action. Every year, he reminds the Monroe community that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be started.
On July 27, 1946, a forensic doctor covered one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to the FBI's files, which were obtained by NBC News, the lynching was supposed to involve up to 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding districts.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the suspects remaining in custody for decades, civil rights advocates say both the reasons for lynching — politics and sex — were known to all inhabitants of the city.
In April 1946, according to a decision of the Supreme Court, the black people of Georgia were granted the right to participate in the elections, which were scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the period of the summer elections that, according to the FBI, black farmer Roger Malcom during a clash had struck white-skinned land owner Barnet Hester - allegedly because of his wife.
In the town, according to Brookes, it was said that Hester had slept with Malcom’s wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison deposited $600 in bail on Malcolm.
He was accompanied by his cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Upon returning from prison, just before entering the Moore’s Ford Bridge, a group of suspects stopped their way.
“As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison,” the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcers, who not only participated in lynching but also removed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.”
Brooks spoke briefly about the matter.
“It was a massacre because of the right to vote,” he said.
“The murders had a clear subtitle for all local black people: ‘This is what you’ll do if you register and go vote.’”
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore’s Ford Bridge has been organized by Cassandra Greene for a decade.
Her performance is picturesque, engaging and appropriate, showing deep-rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn’t easy and it’s even harder to distract, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I’ve had to go through.”
The main trials of this year’s reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors — a dozen whites, the rest black — entered the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is assistant director.
He played the leader of Kukluxklana for many years, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
“I feel bad about it because it’s contrary to who I am,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to recall this part of history regularly because we don’t want to go back to such a time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, then Barnet Hester, are exercising their roles.
The show begins with a clash - Malcom quarrels with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
“Take me out of my land!”
Rashford cannot.
There is struggle.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
“What happened?” asks Rascona.
He is confused.
Was I too rude?
“No,” Greene remarked cheerfully.
“I just don’t think the white people said ‘n—r’ in such a tone.”
“That’s right,” said one of the black actors.
“You have to put more emphasis on R.”
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility will replace the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic. only to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona this time emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The shooting, the shooting, and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
With every word there is sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen spectators are wiping sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are almost the same number of black and white people in the public.
One couple arrived from Ithaca, New York, and many of the attendees came from nearby.
Each of them withstands the local humid climate for almost eight hours and Brooks leads them in crowd to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, murders could have been looked at with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is frightening.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to the victims’ heads, watch false blood and immovable bodies, and whisper something into their ears.
“They’re not dead,” the little boy grumbled.
A few minutes passed and Greene thanked the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, a man in a suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklana.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms.
“It’s okay,” a woman whispered.
“We know that your role is hurting.
You had a reason for that.”
Later that same day, the audience sits together with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks enthusiastically about the show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings about today’s show.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and watch those ugly deeds ... that are done by people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said on reconstruction.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still an up-to-date topic,” she added, “only called police clashes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom and enjoys dinner while talking about civil rights.
He said he was already planning a show for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring as it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to reflect on,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use read only shit.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is a modern form of art, often surrealism.
I remember with nostalgia the times of the long past, when the instructions for using anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
So, for example, my first gramofon contained only one paper, on which there were hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some components, all of which had some secret marks.
When something went wrong inside me after years, I offered that list to a shaman who wasn’t afraid to screw the backboard.
He advised me with a scratch what the labyrinth line paper is suitable for.
Yes, it was the usual aid in chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He playfully found the wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl plates again.
The new era brought new guidelines.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the overcrowded grep was simply stuck, required about ten pictures.
Particularly successful was the sketch with a description of how to insert one part into the other.
The process was two-part and no other method was possible.
Giving it the opposite required considerable effort with the need to break certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-driving.
The year of production 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the blinker bulb.
It was simple.
Three steps and the work was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instructions forgot to state that while the bulb right went to replace really only in three steps.
Separate the cover.
Turn off a broken bulb and start a new one.
3 Cover the cover.
The light bulb on the left had a problem with the location of the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the body of the car, I would find some sprinkle, screw, with which I would easily remove the cover, and then I would be following the points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
Probably leaves.
The cover had no place, no room for a thin hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I wasted half an hour of my life without any success.
The condition was further strengthened by my wife’s entrance into the garage, whom he called, and the words that she heard from my mouth were quite exceptional.
“What are you doing here?” she asked impatiently.
My response took about 90 seconds, but if I skip vulgar terms, there were only two publicable words left.
Change the lamp.
“Why did it take you so long?” she risks with a sentence that could be her last in a long-lasting relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis placed on the torture procedure of the author of the instruction, where the blessing of the burning iron on the hand that wrote the instruction, then the wiping of it so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to the wide range of instructions of the Witch Kladiva, including his commissionary burning on the top above the Losin Castle.
“What about removing that box?” the woman thought of removing the battery.
In pure despair, this happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that until the day when I was called by a colleague who was just discussing the collapse state after checking two officials of the State Drug Control Service.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who knows how to interpret wild stories with an unshaken voice.
“Imagine I’ve been fined for not having a hand washing guide,” he told me with a weak voice.
Gradually I got the whole problem out of it, which was that over the toilet toilet of the patients there was no picture instructions on how to wash their hands.
His argument to the commission officer that adults can usually wash their hands and that they do not need pictograms to handle the usual activities of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
“It’s not just that,” she told him.
He understood that the simple washing of soaked palms with running water is a primitive act at the level of a crooman, that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to tell you that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has eleven points in total, but at the end there is a joyful finding that a man has washed his hands exactly as he is ordered by the SUKL host.
Finally, I have to note that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity at the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there the problem does not arise, in the case of urination, due to certain differences of both sexes, it will be necessary to hang instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because to create the perfect procedure means also a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage in the prudent visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has wiped the corresponding opening throughout his life by a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson to Reduce Dividends and Reduce 3,000 Employees
Britain’s Pearson Education Group said on Friday it would dismiss 3,000 more employees and cut its temporary dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change its business model.
The next wave of redundancies, which CEO John Fallon said will take place at the end of 2018 and early 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to dismiss 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third cost reduction program in an effort to revive the falling trade due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann last month, said its outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in basic sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the city district of Qarabagh.
Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack this month – more than 30 people were killed in an explosion at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a statement, NATO said Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol with members of the Afghan army was attacked by a "local person with a home-made explosive device."
The statement also said that all the wounded soldiers are out of danger and are currently in the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram Air Base.
According to reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of which died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence undermines the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to help military units and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA re-evaluates decision to delay smoking rules in response to lawsuit
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration’s bill that ordered states to cut emissions, just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
EPA announced on Wednesday night its decision to forward the "Ozone Standards 2015" with the words that it presents the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our national partners and will listen to their opinions,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an EPA effort to delay ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen of most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA’s actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama – according to Trump’s words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have triggered countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups fearing the impact of emissions on public health.
EPA reports on its website that breathing ozone-containing air “can decrease lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Bubnár was injured and blood flowed!
This, a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in Czech conditions, hosted by such leading personalities as Master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainová and a number of others, and the event was not moderated by anyone other than Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to show up to the public and to present their music video clip to the song Sara, whose baptism was performed by the just named personalities.
Few people already know that the recording of the video, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and singer Ladislav Bubnar had to be treated.
It was his first major filming with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it did not go without a serious trapas.
The song Sara is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in the video, the singer’s juice had to indicate a blow to the faces.
At one point, however, he struck him so strongly and directly into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, immediately blood came from my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers complained that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav failed to react on time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe that it could affect the continuation of the filming.
The mentioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with a blow in it.
However, the failed version with blood was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at the meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most thrilling lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a Tuesday meeting.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN’s Los Angeles offices until Garcia – the unbeaten lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council – went down to the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s pearl-weight champion.
Following Garcia’s unanimous decision to win against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday’s Showtime match, both boxers got to the list of five best lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, “How is it, champion?
Good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN on Saturday at 19: 00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a “perfect test.”
“I’m a former champion in pear weight,” adds Garcia.
“Because of the match with Broner (67 kg) I had to gain weight, but I’m not that big.
I am very small at 63 kg.
I would like to go back to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko again has to gain weight in order to get a light weight ... then we can fight.
That’s what fans want.
Why not fulfill them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“The boxer would be good at this match.”
Lomachenko is expected to make his lightweight debut at the end of this year and next year to face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in a match against duel winner Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will compete on September 23 for the lightweight title in the Forum arena.
“The match should be in the style of paying for viewing, that’s what fans are asking for,” Garcia said, who later stated that he was open to the possibility of broadcasting the match through the TV station that comes up with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention.
Wait for the right opportunity.”
Garcia said he recognized Lomachenko as a "great boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko didn’t give Garci’s praise when he said the three-division champion from Riverside looks “very slow ... sorry Mike, but you’re talking about a knockout.”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then box.
Both boxers said they felt rising tension ahead of each other's duel.
“You won’t forget this match.
No other game gets so much attention.
And I’ll be happy to put it on fire,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I was waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.”
It will be a great match.”
The couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car was found on the bottom of the Volga.
The young Russians Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
In the end, the police closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
Twelve years later, the story ended sadly.
The wreck of their car was found by a laity diver on the bottom of the Volga river in the city of Čeboksary in Čuvašsk.
Thanks to the documents left in the car, police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived underwater for a decade, without them it would take police much longer to find out the identities of the found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The driver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He his find to the Ceboksar police, which drove the car to the beach the following day.
Investigators believe the death of the young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
The investigation is still ongoing and further details will be announced after its completion.
The latest results of the tests for determining the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were surveyed as older than 18 years old, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rttsmedicinalverket) began performing new tests earlier this year.
The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests conducted between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
80 percent (2002) were estimated to be over the age of 18, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency determined that the respondent was “possibly over the age of 18”.
In another 423 cases, it was determined that the respondent was “probably under the age of 18”.
Tests are conducted only if the age of the respondent is questionable.
According to Johan GÃ¶ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are on track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of asylum seekers who are estimated to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that “the respondent is 18 years of age or older.”
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
Criticism has also been given to the medical method of determining age, which includes x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, is engaged in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age when the person concerned has gone through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend the opposite,” he told Metro.
Forensic medical agency Agency's GÃ¶ransson defended the decision with the words: "In general, it can be said that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the person surveyed is just below the age limit of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the President of Mexico.
U.S. President Donald Trump in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto threatened he would not meet him if he would publicly say that his country would not pay for the construction of a wall between the United States and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to a report published by the American newspaper The Washington Post on Thursday.
Trump made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump took office, Peña Nieto denounced him non-diplomatically for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump repeatedly said in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to make rebellious statements.
Financing is supposed to work out and it will eventually work out.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to talk to you, gentlemen, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is the most important one.
The executive order to build the wall was issued shortly after Trump took power.
Mexico has rejected the construction and financing of a 3,200-kilometre-long wall, causing the relations between the two countries to deteriorate.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid by the United States.
Trump and his Mexican counterpart met for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also about Trump’s phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief said the conversation was ridiculous.
He was led to this conclusion by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States to accept people from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later accepted it.
“You can say that this is not the deal you’ve made, but you’ll have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost cheerful, for example, when Trump appreciated the Australian refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
“You’re worse than me,” Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation increased.
“I hate accepting these people,” Trump said.
I assure you that they are bad.
That’s why they are now in prison.
“They’re not going to be great people going to work for local dairy workers,” he said.
In the interview, he also said that the refugee could become a Boston terrorist in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after he arrived at the White House, Trump had telephone conversations with a number of world leaders, often several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbull eventually described as the least pleasant of the whole day.
He said he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The murderer was executed in front of the crowd.
Her father also watched.
The execution took place in the capital city of Yemen, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father's house, where he raped her and struck her with bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then placed near the mosque.
The violent death of a young girl has struck the whole country, facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-headed crowd that gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim’s father told the media about his feelings.
I feel like reborn.
I was relieved.
This is a new day in my life.
The other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd, shouting the slogan "Long live justice."
The rapist was taken by a police truck from which he was pulled.
The officers put him on his stomach.
One of the men turned his gun against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd celebrated every shot that was fired.
Mr Almatari told MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the country’s legal system.
“Justice, Allah and Sharia law have triumphed,” he said.
I stood on the Square of Liberation in Sana, waiting for the execution of the murderer of my daughter.
My family and I went to the martyrdom.
We took Ranino’s tiny body and buried him in a nearby cemetery.
I and my wife Jamileh are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered on the square would fall into hateful madness, and the murderer would be caught and lined up.
The execution was ordered by a court administered by Shiite Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 beating wounds immediately after his arrest, but his act aroused such indignation that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Rani’s family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the wound.
“Our family has no enemies and the wounds that ran Ranino’s body were terrible,” he told the media.
“The wound disappeared in the afternoon, the same day we it to the police, we told the newspapers and all our television stations, posters with her photo hanged everywhere,” he continued.
They all believe that the police received a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of the horrific act.
The girl’s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter’s body had been found.
She went out to play with other children from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but the wound was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and ran around the area, but we looked in vain.
Residents of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where Al Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the record of the investigation to the crowd present to reassure them.
The accused did not show regret for his actions.
Just before the execution, the police read the sentence to him, but the convicted man only looked at his executor.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but a lot of recordings made by the crowd appeared on the Internet.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Change
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday evening at the assembly of President Trump that he was switching to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Justice said.
“Today, after long prayer and reflection, I announce to you ... today, as a resident of West Virginia, I can no longer support you as a democratic governor.”
The audience exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow I will apply for the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has already promised an important announcement to the people at a gathering in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who, according to Forbes magazine, is the only billionaire in the whole country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
His assets are estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: “The overthrow of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of causing the rise of our country.”
“For the Democratic Party, which has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is the last drop for the already impoverished party without a leader, which is in vain striving to find a positive and unifying message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe apologizes to Russia for doping scandal
Former outstanding athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not the right time for Russia to return to the sporting world.
The head of Russian athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of the World Cup in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into force in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) showed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
“I think we’ve witnessed very honest answers and presentations today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the correct functioning of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been very successful and we have advanced to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the Crisis Staff to maintain the punishment that was thrown on Russia,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we have to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest athletes,” he said.
At the World Cup in athletics, which begins in London on Friday, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag who have complied with the strict IAAF rules.
IAAF Crisis Chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before being admitted back.
Tests for drug presence are still unsatisfactory and excluded trainers continue to run their activities, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board presentation ended.
CzechTrade was purchased by the company of František Savov, whom the state is prosecuting.
The public pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded by Mladá fronta Františka Savova.
Officials awarded him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade CzechTrade issued a public contract in April for four years to provide editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract for a total value of SEK 30.8 million was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta of entrepreneur František Savov.
He was accused in 2014 of tax evasion and is being prosecuted for evasion.
Savov has fled to Britain and the Czech Republic is asking for his extradition.
The incident was by the server.cz.
According to CzechTrade’s original criteria, the award of the contract should be decided by 60% of the price offered and the remaining 40 by the beauty competition, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion was very helpful to Savov’s company.
According to the information, Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
It was precisely this that pushed her in the result ahead of another candidate, publishing company Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Mladá fronta operated with a monthly amount of SEK 404,900, VLM offered SEK 324,350.
Unlike the Young Front, it received an under-average rating from the assessors in all qualitative criteria, a total of 62 points.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which falls as well as the server Aktuálně.cz under the publishing company Economia.
VLM submitted several objections to the tender result, considering its assessment to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition.
It considers that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the public procurement supplier on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the applicant and other suppliers," the proposal for the initiation of the proceedings filed with the UOHS this week, which was published by the server Aktuálně.
According to the general director and chairman of the VLM Board of Directors, Michal Klimy, the selection committee’s score appears to be an unreliable and 100% assessment of the project of the Young Front for all its members as extremely suspicious.
“Every independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious,” he said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public procurements before they are closed.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Contractor Profile and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the termination of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on its course," the media representative of the agency, Štěpán Dlouhý, told Dotyk.cz.
The young front responded with a statement, according to which it considers extremely problematic that the Economia publishing house has struck an article in Aktuálně.cz into a competition where it has its own business interests.
This was mentioned in that article.
She may have helped in the tender because she has been providing editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal for the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova accuses the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to SEK 770 million.
The UK has been seeking his extradition since 2014.
According to Savov, behind his criminalization is the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babiš, under whose influence the publishing house Mafra falls.
A London court last year rejected Savov’s appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any information from the UK on the issue of acquiring legal force of the judgment to this day," the spokeswoman of the Prague City Prosecutor's Office Štěpánka Zenklová told Aktuálně.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Mladá fronta, Savov was involved in the Cyprus-based Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Czech Budějovický brewery Samson, and the Cyprus-based company Maraflex, which profiles as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
He would also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist ran along the trails and the park, and ended up in the pits.
The motorcyclist attracted attention by careless driving on the streets, trails and park paths in Úšovice.
When the guard began to pursue him, he decided to flee in the direction of the Station.
“Police officers were pursuing the man with increased caution through the city when he failed to manage on one of the side roads behind Mariánské Lázně and entered the field with a motorcycle where he crashed,” said police spokesman Daniel Dvořák.
The accident also resulted in the emergency helicopter, which transported the injured motorcycle driver to the hospital.
Later, the police found that the motorcycle driver did not have a driver's license, the registration marks on the motorcycle were stolen, its production number was scrapped and the manufacturing label itself removed.
The machine may have been stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is under further investigation.
"The breath test was done to exclude the presence of alcohol in the driver on the spot, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman said.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting funding for European football clubs will not affect Neymar’s record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint-Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar’s transfer was not funded without large losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
There are several financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Given that the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatar family that has grown wealthy by selling energy, it can afford to bring Neymar into an already-star football family.
Clubs can spend enormous amounts on purchasing players, but on the other hand they must demonstrate legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the general costs of football-related business activities.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he became the chair of UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs in the hunt for new reinforcements ended up cheating and risking bankruptcy if the banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP rules redirected their attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 — to buy a club with potential and spend horrendous amounts on players y to build a global brand — was suddenly not so profitable.
During the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini had to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander Čeferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with FFP rules, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for Neymar’s redemption in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be dissolved to €44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the highest FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million) - which was later reduced to €20 million - and ordered to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is looking out for teams that may try to bypass financial regulators by increasing their revenue through companies associated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatar company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the value of the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the settlement of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it ruled that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
Part of Neymar's income at PSG could, according to some reports, be paid from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 officials have denied that Neymat should become the ambassador of the World Cup and that such a manoeuvre would be easily exposed by UEFY officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA did not initiate any investigation into the transfer of Neymar to PSG.
The source wanted to remain anonymous as he was not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, the Associated Press.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of €10 million and a turnover of €542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and the sale of shirts.
The club promises to increase sales by up to 30 percent.
Representatives of the Spanish league, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to ward off Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate the FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ by the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Teba told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the club by the Qatar syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares the same position of La Liga about funding the club.
“It’s the result of a possession that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“Once the club’s owner becomes a state, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club.”
Spartan defender Rosický: Change is painful, but we have to believe.
16,000 fans on their feet.
Tom Cruise is on the pitch.
Same scene as in Sunday's match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan defender started a game against the Red Star, made a few goals, but his fellow players didn’t target the black.
The flight team pumped with new multi-million supports so after the opening two-match in the European Cups ends.
Was it hard to do anything after the match in Belgrade?
We had to shoot four goals, which was hard for us.
We didn’t want to lose, we wanted to raise our self-confidence so that we could get back into the next game.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why couldn’t Sparta get into the match so long?
The game is terribly developed.
The opponent’s combinations were much better than ours.
We didn’t get anything, we fired one shot in halftime.
This is, of course, terribly little when you have to win two or three goals.
The second half was much better and we managed to play with them in the final third.
But you have to push the opponent more often into such positions.
Are there a lot of changes in the composition?
Of course, this is one of the pain when a new team is formed.
We have only played three matches and the composition is constantly changing.
The goal is for the coach to find the ideal eleven.
Is it encouraging for you that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
These are only parts of the game.
I don’t know how my condition will evolve and when I’ll finally be able to play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise it cannot be.
It is the same as injury.
If you don’t believe, you can’t go back.
Sparta has somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will get worse.
The fans came back in large numbers, but they left embarrassed.
What can you send them?
There was a wonderful visit here again, as well as with Bohemka.
I’m so sorry that we can’t make them happy with a better performance.
Show something that will come next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don’t remember playing like this 15 years ago.
Could a season without cups be an advantage for the league at least?
For now, we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so this is not such an advantage for us.
An entrepreneur will be sentenced to ten years in prison for tax evasion.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of businessman Jiří Toman, who is to pay ten years in prison for reducing taxes.
The estimated damage amounts to SEK 645 million.
Toman argued in the complaint that the justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges called the complaint unfounded, the CPC found out from the court's database.
The Court of Appeal is not another court.
"It cannot, as a fourth instance, judge the factual or legal misconduct allegedly committed by ordinary courts if it does not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution reads.
Thomas was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where he was, according to the resolution, at the time of the U.S. Court decision-making.
The imposed penalty is on the upper limit of the statutory rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court described the case as extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Service from 2005 to 2008.
The damage amounted to SEK 645 million only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage, according to the expert, exceeded a billion.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the entire amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise taxes in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company has traded, have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomír Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison for VAT machination in fuel stores.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The series “Summer to Survive” and “Comrade Detective” play a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for characters from the famous 1980s; for the dirty 1990s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced MTV’s comedy sketch “The State”); and, of course, for the modern era, specifically the year 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd fled to larger projects.
As a cultural artefact, it is a light parody and at the same time an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the point of view, it looks like someone is breathing away.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well – not only because of the absurd humor (an example may be the story of the creation of a speaking can of vegetables, narrated by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors have shifted away from the main funny points - middle-aged actors who play teenage excited children - and could not thus tighten themselves from previous events.
The “Ten Years Later” sequel, in which adults play adults, doesn’t push as much on the emotional plane, and the satire is occasionally sporadic, including a parody to the 1990s thrillers like “The Hand on the Cradle”.
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbooks, wheeled skates, and “a bunch of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main lines of the story are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn’t moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-held by Michael Ian Black).
As always, many side stories are the best part of a franchise.
Especially fun is to watch the forever young Rud with long hair alias Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old pepper.
The franchise could be kicked up by moments of random madness, such as the returning “Seven Up” series, until it reaches what I suppose will be a logical breakthrough: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” where in the final scene the whole band goes to the premiere of “Years to Survive.”
“Comrade Detective” on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different type of nostalgia: the revivalism of the Cold War series “These Normal Americans”, the film “Atomic Blonde: No Regret” and even the series “GLOW”, in which icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene collide.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanak, directed by Rhyse Thomas, is intended to act as a television stage: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – the stubborn Gregor and the idealist Iosef – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whom Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt have translated into English.
It is a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, this is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series has received many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
Comrade Detective, however, is too focused on a nasty propaganda drama – which includes a killer with Reagan’s mask – and it also looks like that.
Six long episodes are too disturbing and comedic moments are not enough.
With a shorter track, the propaganda satire in “Comrade Detective” could work, such as in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in the hall of which two thieves chew hamburgers folded onto a large pile.
A clear message to the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgia.
The ingenious Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture as well as theirs.
The Russian athletes were not able to wait for the lifting of the IAAF ban.
The International Athletic Federation (IAAF) has confirmed the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian athletes due to the state-sponsored doping program.
The vote in the field of the world championship, which starts on Friday, turned out as expected very clearly.
166 delegates voted in favour of the prohibition, while only 21 voted against it.
The main reason for the rejection is, first of all, the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of antidoping system, as stated before Congress, the head of the special investigative group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and coaches with a spoiled reputation still work in the country.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) does not comply with the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can now conduct tests under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
“While progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” said IAAF President Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015 and the Russian athletes lost the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro last year.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Cup, who have previously proven that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
They will not be able to start the championship in national colours and will not be able to play the Russian anthem in the event of victory.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by low economic growth and weakening inflation attracted by speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to remain “at a backdrop” in the context ofining interest rates – despite shrinking family budgets.
Political figures in the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two in favour ofining the interest rate at 0.25%.
In its annual inflation report, the bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that cuts to family budgets will continue.
At the same time, the bank indicated that there would be growth over the next few years due to Brexit-induced inflation, and also said that rents from mobility would rise more than expected on the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to boost the economy and was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the foregoing, a deadline financing plan is expected to come into effect from next February, offering cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15 billion less from the planned £115 billion.
Shortly before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term along with pressure on real household incomes and consumption burden.”
On interest rates, the bank said it would need to “strike the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “at a higher rate” than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year from 1.9% and 1.7% forecasted in May.
The forecast growth in 2018 of 1.8 percent remained unchanged.
Following the publication of the estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent to $1.31 and 0.4 percent to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the current situation came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth – GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
The growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report is a small consolation for households affected by rising inflation and miserable wage increases.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” income declines in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise “significantly” at the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to the high interest in British goods due to the weak pound, which will offset a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were lowered to 0.025% in August last year in response to a shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will take at least four years to fully unify prices and the economy.
Before the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which put increasing pressure on households.
Inflation dropped back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the bank’s expectation of such a change and expected inflation to rise again over the course of next month.
The bank said that the excess relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that the competition in the mortgage market will only rise once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook for the end of the year.
The market looks good for those who terminate existing contracts and renew mortgages – there are free options in offer as well as low rates they are gaining on popularity.”
NHS to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
Patients will get access to ‘transformative’ treatment to prevent HIV from September following a Supreme Court decision to fund the NHS drug.
The English National Health Service (NSH) has announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis pill (PrEP), which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients within a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial period after the Court of Appeal endorsed a Supreme Court ruling last year stating that the NHS had the funds to repay PrEP despite statements that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was taken by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Additional clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a HIV drug administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among the at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
The tested patients include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who will sign consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will bring taxpayers to £10 million and NHS England has signed a contract this week to distribute medicines after obtaining an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of efforts to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, Executive Director of the National Aids Trust, said: “We are witnessing a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually tested and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to improvements in the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement with pleasure.”
Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that they are accessible to every patient.
Now we have the test drug PrEP available and we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that we start testing across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and, together, stop the spread of HIV in society.”
Life on a High Foot: Intermediate and Smart Design Has Transformed This Small Apartment at Earls Court into A Spatial Home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - and is an outstanding example of modern design that utilizes the maximum available space.
“I previously lived with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood,” Joanne said.
I was looking for something at a reasonable price.
I stumbled upon this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him, and I fell in love with him the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone complete renovations.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout – in order to get to the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – Joanne wanted to add storage rooms and a spacecraft to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I wanted a high ceiling, large windows and plenty of light.
That was my request,” she said.
For this purpose, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based Duck & Shed design and design studio and used a four-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such a height as to fit two gaps over each other – the challenge for architects was to create an intersection on which to walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that it was in the right height above and below the ceiling.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on each other - and at the same time add to dramaticity.
In the middle floor, the beautiful living room is looked at by the old copper window frames in the Retrouvius design.
Mirrored furniture in gold, silver lines and retro luster Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is fitted with mirrors on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window into the next room.
At the entrance doors are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storing utensils and glasses.
The advantage of a living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the possibility to separate it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
The kitchen is nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, are the folding doors.
“We had to solve the technical side,” Erfan says of the reinforced forged doors.
“The doors are equipped with a counterweight so that it can be loosened very easily.”
With the smart use of space and storage spaces, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to it, what you are selling is a living area – or a valuation of your property,” Erfan said.
“The real estate agent essentially calculates the price of an apartment when entering the apartment based on the residential area.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while preserving quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t love electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won’t win your heart.”
As it turned out, the high-quality design and increased living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is dividing.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee repayed her in retaliation for banning its citizens from traveling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, citizens of the United States can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned citizens from spending government money on trips to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle as discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed the Conscience Retention Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide such patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that receive children from mothers after birth for adoption are not obliged to give them to same-sex couples for adoption.
Because of these conscientious reservation laws, California has banned the financing of its citizens’ trips to eight states of the union from its own funds.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposiums in Texas, for example, paid by their universities, because they are co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions such as Tennessee with financial support from their schools.
They must either get federal grants to travel, but it’s absurd for the federal government to fund citizens’ trips from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has lost its patience and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California’s policy of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but does not impose a travel embargo on California because of it.
It is being imposed in retaliation for California’s travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same applies to any member state that imposes a similar travel ban on another member state for any reason whatsoever.
At the same time, he urged the parliaments of all countries to stop this madness.
Now the facts, now the comments.
The situation is toxic.
Everything is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on reservations of conscience, as well as to decide what their money is going to and what they are not allowed to do.
What is wrong with conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why should he not offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why do they have to sell pork when there are too many pigs?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to pie a cake for a gay wedding.
She also refuses to cook Halloween cakes or alcoholic drinks.
Why punish him and not leave him alone and not order the corresponding cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system lies in the fact that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies in non-federal powers according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their inhabitants.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas, and seven other states to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
No one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don’t know of a situation in American history where states have done so deliberately on political issues, except in one case.
Even in the time of the struggle for the civil rights of blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was in the 1950s of the 19th century, when the political cause was slavery and the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between blue-democratic and red-republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally interconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin’s criticism was fined.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating the campaign rules ahead of next year’s presidential elections.
The court imposed a fine on him for inviting people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he intends to run for the post of head of state in March next year.
Kremlin’s current chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said police arrived at his home in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for urging people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The penalty is 300,000.
“Later we will cut them off from the judge’s salary,” Kremlin critics joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he was previously convicted of bribery.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the judgment to be politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, was also imposed on two members of the Naval election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are doing everything possible to defend Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five years in prison for robbing Kirovles forestry.
The verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in May.
The verdict is so authoritative that Navalny is not allowed to run under Russian law.
Brothers fight for an empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are now, more than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire, overtaking one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides on the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has driven a dispute over joint property and business assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business in 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly being discussed before the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers owned a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars.The family bought the first store in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the company for $85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money, and the De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping centers.
Paul owns approximately one-third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who, according to Paul’s words, is the “significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
Court records state that Colin owns $316 million in real estate, while Paul manages $176 million in real estate.
For Paul, the distribution of property and funds was a problem.
“Colin’s proposal sounded significantly in his favour in my eyes,” Paul wrote in a statement at the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reach a settlement, the Supreme Court held its first session.
The brothers are now also competing about who will control the existing business – from which Paul, according to his comments, Colin cut off.
Colin objects that this is not true and accuses Paul of mismanagement of some properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a successful settlement of the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of worship statements, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and advocates of both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
For the money earned by building the property, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family business with jeans.
Colin said that when he founded Westco “in his last year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old.”
Anna De Lutis said that along with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to the sons would go well.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated with $10 million at his departure and Luke with $26 million.
As Paul said, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back since then, despite being a former member of the AFL club’s board, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and Colin’s best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colina and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin only responded through a text message, stating that given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul decided to bring the whole matter to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, in one of the statements in court, Colin stated that he was trying to adjust to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that “he still hopes for a successful solution.”
On Friday, there was no hope.
“Our disputes will soon be resolved by a court hearing,” Colin wrote.
Heat in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers have water and summer clothes.
In the Na Chodovci school in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they only go out in the morning.
The school is under reconstruction and the trees have not yet been planted.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower the children in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classes, where the blinds and curtains are removed.
They try to cool the air with the air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
This is also important for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not even have open operation," said the director of kindergarten Miloslava Makovičková.
There is a glassed corridor in the school where the temperature is around 40 degrees Celsius.
We wind up in the morning after 6 o’clock, the windows are closed and we have glarens on the southern sides to protect ourselves.
“It won’t help much,” she added.
Better conditions are in the forest school Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees on the land, so we are under them.
"We have a beautiful nutscape there, there is a table underneath it, and we do various things there," said Barbora Kompanova, director of the kindergarten.
Teachers try to walk with the children into the woods, where there is a larger chard.
The children have water caps and various water games on the program.
"We have a hand pressure nebulizer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
Also, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská street in Prague Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep the children in the shade and drop them with water.
“We have a fairly tall garden, so they’re under the trees,” she said.
They go out in the morning and then only after 5 p.m.
Every child should have a head cover.
Teachers also remind children to drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice, and have drinks with water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad and a snack always fresh fruit and vegetables, sometimes brought by their parents.
“For example, today one mom brought about 10 pounds of melon for the kids,” Makovičková added.
Drivers are given water or summer equinox.
Prague transportation company DPP provides them with water, ionic drinks or summer smoothies on hot days.
The cabins of tram and bus drivers are mostly air-conditioned, DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková said.
In addition to air-conditioning, some of the trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger space.
High temperatures have not seriously damaged the tracks.
A small damage occurred in the hostel.
At current high temperatures, we primarily ensure that drivers have enough drinks at their disposal.
“Cold drinking water is available in all the loopholes, alternating points and roadways,” Řehková said.
In the carriages and in some alternating locations, employees have so-called sodobars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers are also given soluble ionic protective drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers during their daily shifts," the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters in the whole of the Czech Republic killed 108, which is twice the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, when the temperature in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in fighting the fire.
"There are wildfires in the natural environment as well as those associated with harvest work," said fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
The firefighters were not relieved by the evening weather change, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and rains.
There were 236 firefighters involved.
Especially the removal of wounded trees and branches.
“The biggest impact was in the Middle East,” Zaoral continues.
Firefighters were also helped in Stvolínka in Českolipsk, where 60 people were evacuated from a children's camp due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also given the work to the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and the night of Wednesday, ambulances arrived to a dozen cases of carbon dioxide poisoning from carbs.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon dioxide is a colourless, odorless gas that is released by imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and a feeling of fainting.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, it is necessary to leave the contaminated room.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to reduce president’s media diet
Many have tried before him and have always failed.
John F. Kelly can do that.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to curb the flow of President Trump’s information – including television news reports – in the hope of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here is part of a report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met with staff on his first day in his new position, he outlined a key problem Trump’s White House intends to fix: the misinformation that gets into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all information – whether on paper or on word – because the president could make a better decision based on the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors have cracked their teeth on checking Trump and his media presentation.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades — and now, as he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
“If Trump, as a candidate, was upset by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that many other media outlets were talking about him in a positive light, which was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on track – at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly monitors the media that praises him.”
and good.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter was once “under control” is ridiculous.
Per these campaign organizers know something others don’t know about – that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if someone didn’t check them.
The tweets that Trump never sent will most likely never be heard.
If his employees managed to keep him down at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly stop Trump from raising controversial topics.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by submitting Trump’s materials – which may, but may not be reliable – that support their worldview.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the inclination of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
Here is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative news from the media, especially news leaks, and tries to find their origin.
This happened in late February, when someone gave the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com – the provoking Charles C. Johnson website – accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of many leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson was permanently expelled from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not support his claims with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and subsequently withdrew them.
Trump read the article and began asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "seeked to implement a system to manage and document the information President Trump receives."
Would it work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to implement the same strategy.
For example, it turns out that he is a more efficient manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness won’t go away and his helpers are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will surely make Kelly’s mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate a trap and return to 'Millionaire Quarter'
Several of the most dynamic homeowners in West Midland are once again entangled with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the right to regain the fields behind their settlements.
Tourists have parked 20 caravans on a field near a thriving street in Solihull, which is nicknamed the “millionaire district.”
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after they were evicted in May.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated the field with the caravan unprotected gaps that served as the way.
Angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the city’s board of directors of Solihull, saying it “is unable to solve the problem.”
One of the residents, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: “They occupied the place on Monday evening after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones on other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of their inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now returned.
Last night there were more, and today there will be more.”
She added: “The Birmingham Board knows how to deal with this problem and uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and will not pay taxes until the board deals with the tourists.”
Another anonymous resident said, “It’s ridiculous.We just recently watched the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there were more, and this time they brought horses with them.”
A spokesman for the City Council of Solihull said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the land near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to solve the whole problem successfully.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police at number 101.
We will get the overall picture that we will present in court."
A woman’s car crashed in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
A government special transported the wounded Robert Žitňansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane he was under constant control of Slovak doctors.
The long planned flight went without complications.
Róbert Žitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels in early summer.
He was struck by a car and has since been in a serious condition.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace at one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economist is the husband of the Slovak MEP Jana Žitňanská from NOVA.
He did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple have three children together.
Italians Strengthen Against NGO Rescue Boats With Migrants On Board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships that arrive on the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean if the NGO does not sign new rules governing their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, significantly facilitating illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which has been operating for the first year, declined to comment on the case because of the accusations made by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosiosiosi.
“The number one priority for us is and will always be to save human lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the rescue zones at the moment,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all current allegations after we have gathered all the information and assessed the whole situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
The crew is suspected of carrying migrants on board the ship, which were handed over to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting occurred, according to the prosecutor's file, only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya.
The ship’s crew is suspected of breaking the law and bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area – out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable as they do not represent any “substantial change or obstacle” in terms of rescue operations.
The new Code of Conduct was rejected by Doctors Without Borders (MSF), the Nobel Prize winner.
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp decline in migrants disembarking in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen Libya’s coastal patrol and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we have begun to see a light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks to take place this month with Libya’s mayors on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
She had a silicone and cellulite from her overal.
In the hot summer days, you can only wear the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does the opposite.
On the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where the actors, moderators, singers and all those who have anything to do with TV Prima, just haunted, she wrapped her body in a mini overall.
And just a few regular moves were enough and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her butt.
Overall, he had cut her between the halves many times, and she had to cut her so high that she had to adjust it all the time.
There was no need for the attention of the photographers and photographers.
Michelle Carter sentenced for sending text messages prompting Conrad Roye to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two years in prison for instigating her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is sentenced to 15 months of two-year jail sentence and then spent five years on conditional release.
Carter was convicted in June for the accidental killing of Conrad Roye, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is upset.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was released until the decision was made.
She was threatened with up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood on the spot when the verdict was pronounced with tears in her eyes, her hands tied and her eyes turned to the ground.
“Her actions killed Conrad Roye,” the prosecutor told the judge.
She ended her life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t take responsibility,” she said.
“She showed no regrets.”
But Carter’s attorney said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental impairment have no significant impact on her behavior.”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “There will not be a day for me not to mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me – I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever.”
Roy’s sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was “pursuit” by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother’s wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
“The loss of a person I’ve seen since my birth is a pain that I’ll bear with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a valid law that punishes a person who helps another person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014 poisoned with carbon dioxide.
The case attracted the attention of the entire nation after Carter’s text messages were released that incited suicide.
“Either hang yourself, jump out of a building, or bite yourself, I don’t care,” Carter wrote in a text message just two weeks before his death, while Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote to him: “You have to do it Conrade” and “You just need to hit the generator and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter longed for attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to refrain from any commentary in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood on Carter’s side was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi will adapt up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the Audi announcement, the automaker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes that “there are more smart options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is the headquarters of BMW – considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have widely promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of automakers installing equipment to neutralize gases emitted by diesel engines is increasing, making it difficult for automobiles to compete.
While German automakers face careful inspections, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of mocking powerful automakers and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes, which in an effort to meet emission limits installed software in their cars that reduced emissions during testing, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics engine development at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is not subject to extradition, so he may face a trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi joined the German police’s criminal investigation into the Volkswagen case after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits – expanding the accusations Audi faces in the U.S.
Audi’s involvement in the investigation could have a bad impact on Volkswagen: luxury car makers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled to the sea from danger.
Unfortunately, the two men were unable to escape.
A 50-year-old man and an 8-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
“The plane crashed and they were dead on the spot,” said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
Two people were on board the plane, both escaped alive and police took them for interrogation.
D11 or not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic complete?
I’ll give you a guess.
Unfortunately, it was not built, although it was built in 1978.
Even if it’s not done, it’s constantly being repaired.
It cannot be built even if it has a building permit.
What is it?
Highway D11.
The construction of another section of it was stopped for at least a few months by the Children of the Earth movement.
We Eastern Czechs get the highway in pieces, like when cutting salams.
We’ll cut the wheel and then we’ll see when and if we get another.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite streams of trucks drive directly through the city of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonable as to.
But the last section of our dream highway was opened in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a hit since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové have recently begun to be built and archaeological exploration has begun on other sections to Jaromeri with the fact that the construction will begin at the end of this year, you could hear a loud banging of spots in eastern Czech Republic.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it was announced that it will not be built this year.
Maybe not next year.
The Children’s Country Club for Sustainable Transport from Brno has disintegrated.
The Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
The decision on building permits was contested.
In the breakdown, they demand a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the institutions concerned.
For example, the castle magistrate, the Ministry of Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Drawing Office.
So far from D11 we go near the village with the pronounced name Funeral.
So we go down, just go on the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and prefer to subsequently rank in the column.
The worst thing is that you can see similar stories all over the country.
A frightening, constantly clogged road to Benešov, the D1 or D8 motorway.
Everyone has a funeral.
What do the Children of the Earth want?
What is the importance of communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually unfinished in the existing system?
Read the new reflection.
Provence’s lavender threatens climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the southeastern region of France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to the dry climate and harmful insects, provoking horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in recent years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the lifespan.
They are also responsible for cyclones and crabs carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates.”
A lot is at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil made from it is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, less.”
A possible solution may be more efficient distribution of water and slowing the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
Murder of journalist highlights rising threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce regularly meets every Wednesday to discuss the news about the riots that are ongoing in the Sinaloa area involving organized criminals, corrupt officials, and ongoing drug wars.
Today, however, it is under the influence of recent events meeting mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the black board: adversaries, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to name each word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and prejudice.
Choose them from what - drug dealers, politicians, merchants and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence has continued and bodies have risen across the country; journalists are increasing: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 have been killed since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the journal Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to drug trafficking.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is all-pervasive – a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription “Justice” pointed to by the mediator hangs on the front of the building; two journalists – Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez – over 30 years old, carry a shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on the face, glasses on the nose, and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has so far sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime.
Journalists from Riodoca insist that they will report on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; even though they are destroyed by mourning and the mentioned territory is currently very betrayal.
Without information about the murders and without the prospect of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
“It’s foolish to waste time on such meetings,” he added.
“If you don’t get more information, you can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce’s headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloy.
He managed to escape a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, presumably because of the title of the article – which can be translated as The Twelfth River.
The gunmen then entered his car and stormed him near the scene of the crime.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors seem to spread rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill a vacuum.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is filled with two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “firefire” means that a single drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), the co-founder and director of Riodoce, still complains that he did not protect his friend.
Two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that fought the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The reconciliation may have angered the sons; the suspected gang members bought all the copies of the newspapers in the moment they landed on the shelves.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscation of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed it would never change.
In the journal Noroeste he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his shares worth $50 and set up Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning drug trafficking,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a good reputation for courageous and truthful news; the newspapers began to thrive.
Journalists liked to pursue problematic topics and publish texts without censorship – readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee for the Protection of Journalists’ International Press Freedom Award for his brave reporting on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said when receiving the prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloae is “a way of life,” Valdez said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or you have to play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What have you done in the face of death... why haven’t you told me what’s happening?’”
The employees of Riodoce miss Valdez. The man was known for his joke and unselective language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Was this routine the cause of his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
“They don’t like when you get caught up with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landings.”
“These things were forbidden,” said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that there is nothing wrong with it, take your hands away.
The problem is, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, that “the smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then that thing happened with Javier.”
The old rules, he said, as well as others, no longer apply in Sinaloae – just like in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling paths, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet; spyware was discovered a few days ago, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief from the forty-degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the Riodoce offices located in a four-storey building in the urban district of Culiacan.
Journalists are wondering if these police officers don’t belong to the 50 percent of law defenders who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It’s been a few months since journalists last traveled to the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three major events on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They are also aware of suspicious government spending that took place in the governor’s hometown.
Recently, there have also been several abductions at one of Culiacán’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor’s office.
Officially, no one announced the identities of the abducted people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were on the lookout when they were about to write about what every inhabitant of the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination of drug dealers and politicians.
One of the journalists read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption at senior positions.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents in the restaurant, including the incident in which one of Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s sons escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about this topic in Valdez’s section, which was the best source of information about abductions.
“Valdez would decipher the case,” said Villarreal (46), who is nicknamed “El Flaco” for his thin figure.
“Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.”
Valdez’s office turned into a warehouse of stamps and sticker for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Miriam Ramirez, a journalist, was struck by a few slaps and went on a demonstration in front of the public prosecutor’s office the following morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez was murdered in the western state of Michoacán.
Only the burned body was discovered, and the authorities say it was Adamea based on DNA analysis.
Many of them organize protests and march on the paths and buildings of the “SOS Press”.
The head of the newspaper, Bojorquez, is on a day trip to Washington to seek international support and justice for Valdez’s death.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, which took place a day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of tracking journalists and their murder for telling the truth.
Meanwhile, she requested transfer to another department for fear that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly stated that Mexican journalists are “overwhelmed” by organized crime, corrupt officials, and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, “Narco-Journalism,” he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces that cooperate with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
“You die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez said.
Murders seem to work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, which occurred six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my news.”
Next to the head was a keyboard and headphones.
Some branches have decided to shut down, such as the El Norte newspaper based on the northern border of the state of Chihuahua in response to the murder of reporters Miroslav Breach in March.
Others still continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled from their homes or even across borders.
It is a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are being pursued and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up on their work, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is heading to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It’s Friday midnight and the employees of Riodoce are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office – the latest edition sent to the printer – drinking a beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people were killed in a shooting between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlán.
The war is escalating, just as promised by many messages left in this area by members of the syndicate.
Journalists are publishing this news from their mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a single day will pass and the title will change again.
The police siren sound indicates another shooting.
Bojorquez throws a blatant glance at the police patrol to see if they are paying attention.
If they are afraid, they don’t show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their journal — whose mediator is the eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloe — all the employees of Riodoce follow his footsteps.
“How could we think of leaving,” said Bojorquez, “when on the same day that Javier was killed, an internist asked me to send her out into the streets?”
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however frightening.
Researchers have now revealed the conclusions of the first finds of an amazing creature the size of a rhinos, whose perfectly preserved remains – which experts have called the “Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs” – were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such an extent that experts were able to determine the red-brown color of its peeled skin and stated that the dinosaur had a “problematic past.”
A paper in the journal Current Biology said it was “the most preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaurs lived in the Crete period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers, who described him with the words “truly remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, it is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011 in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it closer.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kilograms.
Once the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be uncovered.
“It’s enough to shake your eyes a little and you’ll believe it’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
“It will enter history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved species of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered with armor and resembling a walking tank — was most likely facing a serious threat from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a system of masking used by many of today’s animals.
Experts say it allowed him to fuse better with his surroundings and avoid enemies.The system of masking suggests that he was the favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
News of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. Currently it is available for inspection at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with his team carefully discovering the fossil.
Thanks to the astonishingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and scratches throughout the body.
They uncovered a method of masking commonly used by today's animals in defense - the top of the animal was darker than its bottom.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of the researchers are surprising, as Borealopelta's size far exceeds today's animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that the dinosaur was such a multitude of predators that evolution has preferred masking over confrontation for survival.
Many of today’s masked animals—e.g. a deer, a zebra, or a ribbon—are much smaller and also more vulnerable to prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for their survivors.
“The sale of a giant and heavily armored dinosaur clearly illustrates the dangers that predators posed during the Crete period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the shells also revealed that the dinosaur’s skin was probably red-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and look for further insights about his life, including the preserved content of his stomach, to find out his last meal.
It is believed that the dinosaur after death fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank to the bottom.
The area of Alberta at that time had the same climate as today's Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in being completely covered in perfectly preserved peeled skin while being preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks almost the same as it was in Crete.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to shake your eyes a little and it seems like it’s just asleep.”
During the Crete period, giant teropods, meat-eating dinosaurs, walked through the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been the favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5 meter long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body of Borealopelta was discharged into the sea after being mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, during a drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, which is also complete from hips to hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
From his shoulders emerged two 50 cm thorns.
The researchers believe that this herbivore broke through the territory of today’s Canada until it ended up in the river that flooded it into the sea.
His submarine tomb kept his body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “Finding an individual that is so preserved can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I look at it, the more shocking it seems to me.
The fossil remains of this species are preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front leg with fingers heading upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.”
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: “Who’s the streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a fellow from St. Louis sat down on her bed in an Airbnb room and browsed Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
“The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body still lies on the street,” it read.
She wondered that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah constantly retweeted her posts on the wall.
The St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy shot by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown’s body lying out on the street, where no one took him for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her and her family.
She put off the phone to go back to him in the evening as she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and in his hand held a cedar with the inscription “Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!”
She watched live news — one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a clue in his hand, and on his other end a licking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, was holding a gun in his hand, targeting the crowd and shouting, “I’ll kill you all... animals.”
“That’s not normal,” said Ferrell.
“This is not the kind of murder we are used to and we can call normal.
I felt the skin all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately ordered a flight back and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided that they would go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes the new documentary “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and unbreakability, told from the perspective of people living in a community who come out on the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell established a dialogue with her daughter – dressed in a flower dress and the same flower head – on a topic they had discussed many times before – “the experience with blacks.”
“Do you remember when I taught you how blacks had to fight for what they believed in?” he recalls the interview.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“It didn’t seem to me that I’t take her with me,” Ferrell said later.
“Today’s events are the culmination of what happened in the past.
She had to see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but she also needed to know the difference between the different layers of black experience and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Despite being able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only hurt her.”
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was the South Florissant Road opposite the police station, which became a base for activists waiting for police officer Darren Wilson’s words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together, they prepared food in sacks and helped the Protestants.
A new type of activism slowly began to emerge in Ferrell’s eyes.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the later co-director of the document, Sabaah Folayan, during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "only document" the ongoing events.
Ferrell asked, “Are you working on a document, or are you trying to find a story that could be used?”
This kind of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to earn on pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an interview: “We’ve heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and that’s what we wanted to change.”
Folayan has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, a respected local artist who deals with prisoners of death.
His involvement in the project also involved Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by Whose Streets in the years following Brown’s assassination.
“Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it’s our resignation,” Davis said.
“It was important to me – how these people will be represented – because in the same way I will be represented.”
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences – in an attempt to show that the movement “is not about a salvation leader, but about bringing the community together,” Folayan said – it turned out that she was the most open to participating in filming.
The documentary “Whose Streets?” describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking of the first moment she saw the final version of the document.
“But I understood that in order to do this job and humiliate the Negroes, I had to open up.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created a #BlackLivesMatter campaign on social media in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin – call themselves strangers.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind preserving the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black women must bear the burden of these events.”
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that “the move is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.”
She insists, however, that “this is not a mere affirmative matter” and Ferrell is not the main protagonist of the document because of her views.
“It was the driving force and the source of energy,” she said.
“That she was in the front lines is no coincidence, because life on these intersections in the skin of a black woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for blocking the highway during protests.
The sociopolitical atmosphere in the area he calls home has been described as “disorder.”
Nevertheless, she has not continued in her endeavors, to which she has committed herself since she set out on the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose are our chains.”
There was a fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters arrived and a helicopter helped.
Near Český Brod in Kolínsk, between the towns of Bylany and Liblice, a field of approximately 15 hectares burned from 14:00.
The fire ceased to spread around 15:15 p.m. and firefighters declared a third level of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to the spokesman of the firefighters Ladislava Holomčíka, a helicopter helped to extinguish the fire from the air.
At 6 p.m., firefighters were able to extinguish the fire, causing damage in the amount of SEK 700,000.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the fire.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine.
The helicopter also carried out six water shoots.
"The place of the intervention we handed over to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holomčík said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from hair and mouth strips sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is titled A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before his departure from the post of President of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning’s DNA and using 30 portraits to depict what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the subordination of DNA – as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted – and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about herself as a woman since her youth. She was convicted in 2013 on the basis of twenty charges, including breaches of six spying laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were detained by the prison staff. Only one lower-quality black-and-white photo leaked to the public, where Manning, apparently concerned, sits on the driver's seat in a platinum-blonde pair she is now associated with.
In 2015 there were still positive reactions to Dewey-Hagborg’s 2012 Stranger Visions project.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects – such as cigarette tickers and chewing gloves – to create an image of possible images of these people.
And it was at that time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in jail and wanted to add a portrait to the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
Visits or photographs were not allowed, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned mum had been in friendship for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic titled Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and could attend the show in person.
In fact, a few days after the comic book was released, President Obama requested Manning’s release, a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a military prison in Kansas.
It’s really interesting that the exhibition takes place at a time when Donald Trump is waging a war with people seeking to disclose government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite resentment in areas he should support with his tweets.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the artist’s statement on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her enormous signature (the letter “i” in the last name is streaked by the heart) for the end of “self-dealing fractionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.”
On the opposite side are sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - a stone of the letters C, G, and A recorded with a pencil.
By adding 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“I hope that people will appreciate that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
“DNA tells many different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, placed in a separate room, is a single page from the above graphic novel.
It depicts Manning emerging like King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in her hand.
“Once they stop you from speaking, they win,” it says.
“Never be silent.”
“It’s a direct transcription of one of the letters,” said the Philadelphia artist.
“When I think of it, my skin is shaking.”
Manning hasn’t personally visited the exhibition yet—which was predicted in the comic book—but when it happens, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic imagery, sorted as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplos groups are recorded with a pencil.
“In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the shape of Chelsea and liberates her.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Searched for Murder
A national search is ongoing these days for a professor at Northwestern University and staff at Oxford University who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man who was found beaten to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment, police said.
A first-degree murder warrant was issued on Monday against men named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranley, according to the Cook County court file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died of several sting wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the man was found on July 27.
When they arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments, they found a victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau has been declared dead on the spot and detectives are investigating the case as a murder.
Lathem has worked as an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, university vice president for public relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been banned from entering the university’s school premises.
“The entire matter is now being investigated by the competent authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in a statement sent by email: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked by the fact and wanted him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he urged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“Police has information about their location and efforts to track down the suspects are escalating,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the Grand Plaza administrator, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to take place in apartment number 1008.
Police described the scene as violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim,” Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management issued a statement to all residents: “The police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
“We will complete the WADA plan in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the re-establishment of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“At present, part of the criteria for the new plan have already been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, the WADA plan has been updated,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA’s plan to comply with the Code – which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA – which was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, the code does not contain anything Russia should be concerned about.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
One of the above criteria, however, calls for public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about alleged government sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures were taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, so we cannot admit something that never existed.”
Vitaly Smirnov, Director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with RSport Russia, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely unreserved,” Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected Russia of imposing doping controls within Russia in November 2015, just before the doping scandal.
The organization, however, authorized the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “on the right track” to resume its operation.
The police charged three people, one of whom was a minor.
The police accused three men of setting up a fire on Wednesday in a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech on Frýdecko-Místecko.
One of the accused is a minor, all three are Czech nationals.
For a crime of general threat, they risk up to 15 years in prison.
This was stated by Moravskoslez police director Tomáš Kužel.
According to him, it was a deliberate crime.
"This is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the whole matter," Kužel said.
He said the police will discuss the possible arrest of the defendants.
Further information cannot be disclosed by the director.
“I can’t tell you more yet, because the criminal police and investigators and the prosecutor who oversees the matter are actually working on the matter,” Kužel said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Ghouta dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Material damage is estimated to amount to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
After the fire, the church was rebuilt.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is counted.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabova was also destroyed by a fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by an electrical failure.
Then there was a copy of it.
The state counts on the citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations used in the defence of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the substantive purpose of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is counted.
The Ministry of Defence, which has been commissioned by the government to process it, promises that it will increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is according to a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the branness.
According to the authors, the basic goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help increase the readiness of the Czech people to defend the state, outside of the performance of the duty of defense and on the basis of voluntariness.
The state would, for example, financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would enable them to increase their members’ abilities.
In return, it would obtain data on the people who are willing to come to help the country in times of crisis if necessary, and their abilities or material equipment.
There could also be accredited instructors who would assist the associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also counts to organize talks with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One possible option is to create a new office that will be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their capabilities only after the declaration of a state of danger.
“The whole concept must respect the gradual erasure of the previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats,” it said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that therefore it is necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not just military ones.
“The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or contribute to the protection of others, and not to hinder the performance of tasks for the armed forces of the Czech Republic by incorrect behavior.”
The adoption of the law would result in considerable financial costs.
The amount will depend on the chosen option.
For example, the Office foresees financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to SEK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination center was established, its operation could cost around SEK 60 million a year.
Additional money would go to pay or to build an information system.
The proposal also presupposes that the scope of the district military headquarters would have to be expanded to employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
Representatives of the ministry have said earlier that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive concerning the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees have expressed their mistrust in the entire process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, e-commerce owner of the San Francisco-based hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from the outside.
New HR startups are constantly emerging in the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, further offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that track your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said she has gained greater awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years thanks to Glint.
In addition to quick surveys and team-specific voting, Glint offers a company temperature map and a brief overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as a low-rated manager overview – allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize the need to take care of the workplace culture – in case it becomes another Uber – which is plunging into scandals after a former employee posted a post on his blog describing the company’s environment and harassing employees who dare to speak openly.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture research represents a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let’s Talk Payments website, which looks at technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Startup Convercent from Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before Uber scandals.
Among the 600 customers of Convercent are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also come under its wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “blitz” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If a Director-General is involved in the issue, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The public opinion court has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of ill-treatment of its employees or unethical behavior – and if the regulators do not act – it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, employee depletion, or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employee awareness of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate leadership.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to search for a telephone number or email to the management of the company, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a deterrent and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s chief executive, according to which there was previously no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it is guaranteed to quickly detect and resolve problems that have never previously reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from actual complaint resolution – such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair treatment.
"It's close to a holistic, overall view of employee experiences," said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday group overseeing risk management.
“At the same time, we protect shareholders from legal disputes by employees.”
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee involvement lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s collapse over employee ethics abuse, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “social media came to light” that companies began to realize that in the online world they couldn’t just hide their skeletons in the closet.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
Convercent raised a total of $10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in its February campaign and eventually raised $47 million in capital.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and $60 million over the course of the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing number of surveys clearly confirm that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to feel that they are received and appreciated and that they dedicate their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“When people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, a vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit if a company thrives and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is not surprising that there will be a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company requests feedback from its employees, big changes can occur.
And if the change does not happen quickly – in the worst case at all – it can provoke disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, chief consultancy at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
“Because once you don’t get things done, employees start asking, ‘Have they heard me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should it interest me?”
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to solve the problem in one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by the slow decision making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important insight into its employees and hopes to high employment rates in an industry known for frequent dismissals in the long run.
“Unless you strive to create a transparent working environment, employees won’t trust you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company collapses.”
Thursday was the warmest day.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic with 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in Strážnica na Hodonínsku.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the hottest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Thursday, there were no record temperatures.
The heat hit Moravia, and it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations over 30 years old were broken or equalized.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measurement stations recorded.
For example, today’s temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica, Břeclavsk, today’s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of the degree and in Pohořelice, Brněnsk, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records came from 2013.
High temperatures occurred mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strážnica, the biggest heat was in Dyjákovice in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyjí in Břeclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not beat the record.
By contrast, in the western and northwestern Czech Republic, the highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
“The temperatures started to rise there until later in the afternoon,” meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually resonate and more heavy rains may occur on Sunday.
However, high temperatures will remain in most parts of Moravia on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We had such a mess here.
Billionaires don’t get the same vote as every adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as stubborn as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of the Penta Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fryč, sponsors the Robejškovy Realists.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The accused corrupt and Czech gambling king Ivo Valenta has acquired the Party of the Private.
The Agrofert political movement, as the Andrey Babiš project has been named by the mayor of Kroměříž Jaroslav Němec, is a chapter for itself.
A billionaire has also been arrested.
It is Dalibor Dedek, owner of Jablotron security equipment company.
He goes into politics to do good.
But the entrance to the grandfather’s dress didn’t work well.
“I’ve never dreamed of small goals,” he said at a news conference.
This means that my goal is to get the ANO movement to get the mayoral movement to win 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo was rattled.
But my grandfather’s deception is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for the votes of the voters in the Mayor’s Dress, he continues to support Andrey Babiš.
He supported Babiš in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babiš is not a sharpened speaker and does not rule the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
He doesn’t go into politics because he wants to get better.
My grandmother is a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world that he has under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayor’s introduced him as a new reinforcement, he acknowledged his admiration for Babiš again.
And he said he wants the mayor to learn how to cooperate with the grandmother.
Some may appreciate that Grandfather does not change his views and stands behind him no matter what kind of dress he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babiš is sending to the Mayors to build his bequeath someone so immortal.
Others may ask whether Jablotron’s head and Agroferta’s head have not broken up in a bad business and are not looking for another way to defend their business rival.
But the first public appearance of Grandpa was not just about Grandpa.
He promised to send 10 million crowns for the campaign.
If they need more money, they will send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to say something like this.
Zdeněk Bakala, a judgment-recognized gauner, spent millions on all parties before the 2010 election.
The Political Division of the security agency Víta Bárty, TOP 09 and the Citizen Democrats have come together to thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than three million to a political party.
When he got into politics, he could at least learn the rules of the game.
You may not have to ask why we have such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics were crowned by a proposal for tax benefits for families with school children.
People with higher education come to us about fifty thousand a month.
Based on less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich.
The poor twenty.
In Dedek’s vision of society, the poor pay taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a social state, in which they do not participate too much.
We need to help the rich to avoid misery.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babiš can multiply hands.
Thanks to my grandfather, we can tell you that billionaires are not good people.
The question remains who to vote for.
People who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who have neither members of their party nor citizens and citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
Nobody wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And many times he will not help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent sea view, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
At the sale of the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers, the price went down by an incredible £8 million.
This was by Mirror.co.uk.
The booklet reads: “Hello, Donald J. Trump.”
Stay in a place like no other.
But even the connection of the real estate company with the American president did not guarantee an extreme price.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean residence by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price dropped to £13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
There is nothing to be surprised.
A stunning residence of 5 acres on the Caribbean island of Saint Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
There is also a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal prices of properties on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculations, he paid about £15 million.
The property was purchased for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With the new price, it ranks in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end up with two training sessions a day.
It’s about eleven in the morning, and UCLA’s American football players are striking at the side lines of the new school court.
Some of them take off their shirts and reveal a swollen back, an unfailing sign of the first day of a training camp.
For most members of the team, these few minutes of doing nothing add to a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training to study for final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that takes place next morning at 6:30.
“For these guys, the next three days are going to be a big deal,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said a moment before Monday’s overbought on Tuesday.
By removing two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday, when the final tests end.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled at 19:15 – to get stuck into the already overcrowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and training is limited during the summer semester.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled until August 20, with the formal preparations for the first match against Texas A&M, which will take place in September.
Mora has been told to support the decision of the NCAA, despite adding another item to the already busy diary of players.
“Three or four days the players are under a lot of stress and it’s very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when looking at the clear lines of the surrounding land from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by the players after harvesting the protective net behind the goalbar.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that once the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
“The land will be guarded by the security service,” Mora added.
“Security is being taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
Such materials are well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by the security guard, as well as the parking lot No. 8.
We will use our resources to the maximum.
I believe everything will go well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook Plans to Increase Fact Check to Reduce Fake News
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display findings under its original posts in an effort to fight the so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company says it will use up-to-date machine learning to detect potential hoax, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed news have affected last year’s U.S. presidential election.
French voters are flooded by a lavine of fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on social media networks ahead of the September elections if it does not remove angry posts quickly.
In a statement released in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was about to start testing a new fake news control feature in the U.S., France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party-verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and can make the right decisions about what to share,” said Sara Su, Facebook’s product news manager.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
Graphic Novel: A Castle in England
Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the Squeeze music video, where Margaret Thatcher also found refuge during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney, from his cozy place on the Bewl River in Kent, England, witnessed 700 years of tumultuous history that inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County - known for his passion for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
“The look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of the families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edward period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes’ first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by British Library documents – a project that was very emotional for him.
“I was intrigued by the fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,” he said.
This is his fingerprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When I look at the letter now, 300 years later, it’s like I’m back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and the Arts Council England and the possibility of staying in the castle for four months is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, browsing the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on the wall and the bottles that had been thrown in the corner for centuries.
He walked around the land and explored the ruins of the old castle, spoke with landlords, gardeners and sometimes also with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively large unknown, as the National Trust only gained access to the documents in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived on the site ten years later, the staff had only just begun to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described in words like “the aristocrats of many centuries throwing out their hands with the words, ‘Take it into the loft.’”
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps depicting possessions: “You may think the dispute over land is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case where two families were dragging over a breeze.
Leave that people!”
Some stories in the book use the castle as a bridge and dive deeper into English history, including The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
“I found a record of a 1380 uprising at the castle, which was in the book entitled Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually began in this area, and I thought the uprising was a good starting point.
It may have something to do with each other in the end.”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle – such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell’s family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about a 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was uncovered).
Rhodes’ favourite family is the Darrell family: “I was interested in the male generation – men at the time were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family have solved this by marrying rich or old ladies—I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to beat their heirs.”
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes seeks further adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stand in the Finnish wilderness, where he was sewing inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
This is a special place for Scotney.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I thought, ‘Now fucking go back to real life.’”
Washington changes green card terms
The media released President Donald Trump’s words about the new U.S. immigration plan, within which there will also be a change in the granting of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to decrease by 50,000 annually as a result of stricter rules on issuing temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers.
The law will reduce the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
“The new application process will give preference to English-speaking applicants who are rich in funding and will demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said.
Sex Robots are on the Rise – We Should Be Aware
Just as it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots appears on the Internet.
Yes is.
Sex robots are really popular today.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of their eyes, the shape of their nipples and the appearance of the robot’s nails.
“People are struggling with them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said.
Modern sexual devices are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch – of course, artificial intelligence imitates human behavior.
The user can “adjust” the robot to his image – from the color of his eyes and the shape of his nipples to the appearance and color of his nails.
Very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame the Stepford lady.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set various character traits to his replacement woman, including shyness.
And then there’s True Companion’s Roxxxy Gold sex robot woman that comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the “frigid Farrah” characterized by a shy nature and the “wild Wendy” with a “adventurous” nature.
“The Roxxxy Gold personality is configured to match your personality as much as possible,” says the True Companion website.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
He is humorous, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in a mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons - among which does not include the confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Worrying are rather inferior female character traits and violent narrates - e.g. frigid (read resistant) Farrah.
True Companion on its website imitates Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have a Roxxxy?”
Sex robots, however, are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture – a shift from ideal or gender equality to the desire for sublime sex with an optional attribute.
Most men, of course, don’t buy a robotic woman, and while FRRs talk about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the brink of public interest.
This marginal interest, however, can become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people are not strange or violent until they are excused by the free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are fighting for their rights and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very defamatory about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Servant's Tale is not what we see - hanged bodies and scratched eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The story of the maid represents a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should be as similar as possible to real women (although with the standards of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to touch and look like a real woman at first sight.
But when their “personality” happens, a robot can’t replace a real woman.
They can’t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history.Nothing that encourages their independence or undermines their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st century is servant.
NBA star on green.
Curry is fighting in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose in the professional golfers, despite the spaced first blow at the premiere start.
The double-winner of the NBA Most Useful Player Award played the first round of 74 beats at the Ellie Mae Classic Lower Series Web.com Tour in Hayward, California and will fight for a cut.
The Golden State player, who won a second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started a lot nervously and his first kick ended in a beverage holder in a golf cart parked at fairway.
Even then, he wasn’t as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four strikes over the pair.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, having to call the referee right after the first blow, but then it got a little saddle," Curry said, saying he was trembling.
It was very nervous to shoot the first shot in the tournament, but that was all I hoped for.
“If you told me I’d play 74 in the first round, I would take it right away,” he said.
If Curry manages to struggle with a cut, which will probably be set two shots under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
“I want to play better next time and now that I’ve got rid of the tremors, it’s probably going to go,” said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in the past at celebrity tournaments and mixed amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time at the tournament, which falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsorship exemption and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump’s Great Victory?
Mitt Romney is a sign of common sense.
An unmistakable sign of the Trump era are political divisions that divide American voters and, on a micro-scale, break up entire families.
During Christmas and Thanksgiving, American newspapers were full of advice on how to consult with relatives who voted for Trump.
We’re just waiting for our nerves to let go.
Less attention, however, is paid to Trump’s ability to shrink the family.
I’m talking about it because this week my cousin, a poet and fan of the Left who lives in Chicago, visited me in New York and who has long paid for a Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that confronting a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the family — including all the Republican brothers with whom she has talked about politics for years — is on the same wave.
Dinner at a family table is a good thing; but it shocks me that in a wider context it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we’re referring to the frightening possibility that his scammers might one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart, I recall Mitta Romney and his version of the crazy action – a dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we had awareness of his tax return) – both of which look very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin’s visits and took the kids to Central Park on the largest wheelchair run by New York’s Park Department – you won’t find a better use for your three dollars unless you need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the center cylinder is covered with glass laminate - clowns and animals shoot and look at their own shoulders in horror - a completely cloudy view and the cuddly music strangely resembles public transportation.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama looks, instead of breathing the atmosphere on you, and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn’t get over the fact that the Swiss Cottage isn’t actually a Swiss cheese – not counting the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage – but a subway station in London.
The Central Park wheelchair, however, gives a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-olds, as well as two mature women, will have great fun on it.
If I could evaluate the wheelchair, he would deserve the maximum of points.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale from one to five when paying with a credit card.
In the cafe at the corner of my street, it’s the same, with the difference that I can get a 15% drinking fee for something I buy behind the counter to rate.
Not only does this slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to rub into the favor of the buyer when it is not necessary.
The woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my credit card pass by five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was taken to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to hospital.
Last year he was treated for cutting wounds to the wrist, which he caused himself after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appeal against the original murder sentence.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in early morning on Valentine’s Day in 2013 with several gunshots through the door of a toilet cabinet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claims he confused her with a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the trial will take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could be sentenced to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a young man in captivity has given birth to a panda who coupled in the wilderness.
This is a huge success for the Panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genofond of pandas held in captivity.
An employee of the center, Chang Chung, told the New China news agency that the panda breeding is at high risk due to relative intersection.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas lived in captivity.
Only 2,000 survive in the wild.
Trying to pair captured pandas with the wild ones is the first step in helping the pand breeding to protect the species.
The fifteen-year-old Cchao-cchao was released to the nature reserve at the beginning of the panda mating season on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on her neck, scientists were able to observe every step of her.
She met Cchao-Cchao 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male pandas lasted one and a half minutes and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because the pandas are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
The males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, moreover, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even given that Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were arrested by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
They were released the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
The court said it could impose a fine.
Spilková is in fifth place after the first round of the British Open.
Golf player Klára Spilková figures after the first round of the British Open major on the divided 50th place.
The field in Kingsbarns, Scotland, went by with a score of one hit under pair, playing three birdie and two bogey times.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player thus has hope to go through the cut on the famous major for the first time.
Entrance to the competition with a subsidy of $3.25 million came out best to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the field record of 64 strikes, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Netherlands Food Safety Authority NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry-eaters, meaning 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that the risk poses only a limited number of types of eggs identifiable by specific numbers.
According to German authorities, the amount of the toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chicken from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities have also closed up farms, have not been imported to the Czech Republic lately.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in whose markets problematic brands of the insecticide have appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands last time in May.
Chicken from Belgium was last seen in the Czech Republic in June.
There is a lot of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of preparations against fleas, all and ticks.
It should not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the product to be highly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is wonderful, I will miss it, says the goalkeeper Sedláček and is looking for engagement.
I want to catch 10 years.
“I’m going to go back there one day,” said the 27-year-old Sedláček, who could start the season in the Zlín Dres.
It depends on whether he will get a job before the start of the new year.
What were the years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to do it in school, I would have to do it for three.
I didn’t catch much in the first year, I had an experienced goalman ahead of me.
I have studied.
The next year I started to catch.
Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought a new goalman, with whom I changed again.
Last year I thought I was going to keep going.
But in the first ten games we won maybe only five points, so the coaches started to turn it.
At the end of the day, my colleague got more.
But so it is done.
He wanted to play for next season.
How was life in Riga?
The wonderful.
It is a small Prague.
A beautiful, historic city.
I will miss.
I found a girlfriend there.
We’re together for the third year, and we’ll get married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is the KHL for the goalkeeper?
The first ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan who have to change their style of play against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I did not see any problems in the field.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the UK.
Do you have trouble traveling across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is mostly done so that you play four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do the Latvians view their club in the KHL?
as a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
They all fancy.
Even though it didn’t work, there were a lot of people.
Did the performance of Dinama in the KHL help Latvia to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Championship?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their results at the world championship have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarter-finals against Canada by 1:2.
This was an incredible result for them.
The NHL has reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are headed to the Czech League.
In Zlín, Roberts Bukarts went forward and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why are so many coming here?
They’re not bad players, they’re really good.
The teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew I’t go back to Riga.
Then we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn’t have a budget for the goalman, we didn’t agree.
Then it was classic.
We talked with different teams, but in the final they chose someone else.
So I’m training at home in Zlín and I’ll wait for something to appear.
Are you not nervous about it?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn’t know what would happen.
The situation is not the best, but I’m at home for a while.
I’ve gotten something in the KHL, so I’m taking it differently.
The question is when and where to sign.
How real is the possibility that the new year will take place?
Anything can happen.
We’ll see what happens in a month, what happens.
I can only wait for what the agent will say.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn’t the one I could choose.
I wait for the phone.
The government flight continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article with the care of the regular farmer? among others, about the camp in the years at Orly.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so let me remind you of the main passages of the article.
There has been talk of the camp for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it will probably be best to look at the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, we learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a gathering camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a Gypsies camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were 420.
A very sad history of the enormous afflictions of human beings caused by human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no doubt that these events need to be constantly recalled.
There is no dispute that this commemoration should take place at a memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pork was built near and on parts of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was uncovered in the Years.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised ransom and demolition, but so far it has not happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Memorial of Lidice.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to shut down the pork.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was only last autumn that the government approved the purchase of strawberry and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy pork.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably be marking those intentions if I go public with them."
Let’s see what the expert opinion brings.
Some estimates say it could cost hundreds of millions, while others say it could cost up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in whose modifications the state invested in 2010 almost ten million CZK.
Even if the entire transaction was financially funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is obviously not in danger, it would, in my opinion, be a waste of money.
Does the government have any priorities?
The memorial, a dignified place of worship, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wants can bow down to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this.
Let’s leave it as it is, and keep the southern place with the utmost care.
The person responsible for the assets entrusted, i.e. the money of taxpayers, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should be treated with the care of a regular farmer.
At least as in your own company.
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
But I still perceive from the perspective of the above facts the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as empty pre-election proclamations.
In May this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent arrival road, modified parking, replicas of wooden camp barracks.
In one exposure, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and with views of its own pietne place, which is created from stones located in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and crowns.
All the attributes corresponding to the significance of this place, as decent and belonging.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be impossible, for example, to preserve part of the foundations discovered and to make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
Minister of Culture Daniel Herman.
If he succeeds in the government to promote the purchase of pork for state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
But a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. inhabitants and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, however, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that promote intestinal resistance.
Leading the study, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the gut and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the dishes of the weights tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the scientists found the presence of immune cells supporting the body’s tolerance in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan – one of the building blocks of proteins – to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more immune cells they had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if the same proves to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a type of immune cell supporting body tolerance, discovered that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice bred separately had no cells.
It derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome – a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were tested using the DNA sorting method, and the researchers found six species of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the second group of mice lacked.
The mice that were kept in a sterile environment and lacked the intestinal microbiome – they did not develop this type of immune cells – were given L. reuteri bacteria – and they created immune cells.
To understand how the bacterium affects the immune system, the researchers cultivated L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid – without the bacteria – to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
The immune cells have developed into tolerant cells.
After removing the active ingredient from the fluid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us hold L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Everyone of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase the cell population.
Jose Mourinho considers signing his contract with Nemanja Matić and his transfer to Manchester United “genial”
Manchester United got a “genius” into their team in the form of Nemanja Matiće – at least José Mourinho thinks so after the backback made his debut in Wednesday’s match against Sampdoria.
Matić, who signed a £40 million contract, showed up in his first match by winning 2:1 in Dublin – the last presidential match ahead of the UEFA Super Cup, where United will face Real Madrid on Tuesday – and impressed in his role as a backback alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereir.
However, as he did not participate in the team presidential Asian tour, Matić had no shape and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, needs to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
“It takes time, but he’s experienced, intelligent, and has a brilliant mindset – he’s thinking football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get back in shape as soon as possible.”
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source this week announced that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists the club has done “fantasy work” and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank you to the club for helping me get three of the four players,” he added.
“Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I recognize that they did their best for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins.
He wants a lesson!
That promising picture began to be drawn thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zdeňkova Academy.
Ferguson immediately took a chance.
"Dear Zdeňku, I would like to sign up to your cooking academy because, hand on heart, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on the social network.
And since the two have been on top for several years, Lada has not forgotten to irritate him this time.
“In exchange, I can teach you the snack of diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to the water and show you why the fried cheese is your favorite.”
He takes his participation in Pohlreich’s new show really seriously.
It’s time to step up and learn from the master.
“The question is what the boss says,” said the Lightning.
Pohlreich did not comment because he was shooting new parts of his next show Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hruška’s participation in the culinary academy with the fact that he takes the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes outside of television.
Hruška planted a big blow to Pohlreich in December 2004 as his first cook.
In just a few days, it sold over 300,000 units.
The new program, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference for the autumn broadcast schedule, is a fake cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his students from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve works.
In the last part of his show Now Cooking the Boss in November 2014, Zdeněk left a cracked pear on the back of his trick.
If he had my face there, I would laugh a lot.
“I just laugh at that peach – the peach is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins,” Lada responded.
The culinary arts are thought of.
"To cook according to Ladi Hruška does not come into consideration at home, because I do not allow gastropunk at home," the boss clearly said.
I admire Zdenek Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken for honey.
In my program, but his recipes will definitely not appear," Hruška did not forgive himself.
He is a fool!
He’s not a cook, he’s a clown.
"Gastronomickej analfabet or fool," Pohlreich said about Hruškov at one lecture.
"I'm not twenty years old to be able to mow my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," Hruška said.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip right in the body. by just shaking his hand he can unlock the door from home and office and even start a car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and his index and is now offering the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
The procedure of implantation and treatment is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted to dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam also offers a service for replacing microchip-compatible door and car locks.The price of one lock is £300.
A married father of one child has integrated the technology into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple touch of his hand.
White House recovery cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a navy helicopter to South Lawn on the occasion of the U.S. manufacturing industry celebration last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records released by the weekly TIME.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the culmination of the July 17 program at the White House, which was a showcase of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials visited a product show from all 50 states.
The Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car, and a fork-shaped lifting wheel from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the helicopter to be present less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an “extraordinary” event, records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) — the unit responsible for managing the helicopter — said.
“I wanted to make sure you are aware of such a significant event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the Navy’s Deputy Air Force Commander, the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 about 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the show, which is scheduled to start at 15:00 and will remain on site until the entire site was completely cleared, which was scheduled between 18:00 and 21:00.
The e-mail also stated that if there was a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew would be sent for a return flight due to working hours regulations.
The original crew remained on the spot that evening along with the helicopter and with them also a unit of security personnel.
From the records – obtained by the weekly TIME – it was not clear whether the second crew was eventually sent as well.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government assets for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay,” the commander wrote.
“It sounds like you’re blocked,” the deputy commander wrote.
This “Made in America” show was designated by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even the official events have political subtext.
During his participation in the events, the president promoted the health care reform that was going through the Senate and spoke of an effort to keep the government’s regulations on track.
The use of aircraft such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
They use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane flew in the background at his first first meeting as part of the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed by complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is pleased with the ‘Made in America’ show, which showcased products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, the deputy press secretary.
The crew of the HMX-1 helicopters often train landings in the area of Washington and South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with the utmost accuracy.
While Trump attended the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 exercise landings near the White House.
The flight to the Made in America show was part of the current training of the crew, a state official said.
The helicopter unit flew on the same day for another eleven hours as part of “non-presidential support missions”.
The White House said no additional receipts had been paid from taxpayers’ money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not in any way interested in negotiations on the exposure of the helicopter at South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the show is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records show the time 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are much below that amount.
“It is very misleading to state taxpayers’ costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement,” Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, reimbursements for DoD expenses do not include staff costs, but include fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated the use of a helicopter for the show.
“The idea of the show that takes place this week is to introduce products made in the US,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defense of our state and to provide jobs for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact should be remembered.”
It is unclear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his flight to South Lawn. It can only be said with certainty that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire cars.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I own three.”
A young woman was stuck in a well near Máchovo jezero, the police broke to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday around 2 o’clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the water.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help with her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police patrols took to the place she described, but finding the young woman was not easy at all.
“Some of the police officers had to browse the rainbow wetlands hundreds of meters before they felt a solid ground under their feet,” Baláková said.
She was also missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction from which her call for help came.
“In order not to lose this connection at least, they agreed with her to count off loudly,” the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman in three-quarters of five in the basins in the locality of Borný.
She was on the verge of physical and psychological strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
An ambulance carried her to a Czech hospital.
A grandfather’s relationship?
A desired bride becomes a selling girl.
That is a bit of irony.
With his web project searcheslusny.cz as if a billionaire was essentially telling voters that STAN is suffering from a decent people deficit.
He also argued that the politically dissembled party of less well-known mayors and independent ones actually has no national program for parliamentary elections.
After an interview with her grandfather, she becomes a decent candidate, whatever her political opinion.
Once upon a time, it started like this, and it didn’t happen very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, which will eventually replace some mayors in the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, Deed also cancels the favourite argument of the head of the STAN that the biggest value of the movement is precisely politically verified and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians, according to surveys.
They are quickly replaced by unknown personalities.
The total breakup with the people, after which the STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the people's candidates.
But if only a few people suspected of the identity of the STAN, after the arrival of the Grandfather, a mere game of identity ends.
Not only was Gazdík long opposed to the ANO by Andrey Babiš, but Dedek, who publicly praises Babiš, said at the first joint press conference: "My goal is that the ANO movement, i.e. the Mayor's movement, will win twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Hopefully you didn’t mistake the move.
My grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and a billionaire is not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babiš, but he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been reminiscent of a reality show rather than a real political party for some time now, and Dedek’s help hand seems to have made the desired bride a selling girl even more.
For some time, STAN went with the TOP 09, then with the people and now for change is looking for decent people.
Hopefully someone will call.
Police dogs train helicopters on the bridge
Dogs specializing in explosives search and search dogs today trained to fly by helicopter near Lake Most.
A police dog must not be fearful and be afraid of flying, said the head of the police kynologists of the Ústecký kraj Petr Tomášek.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
Both adult dogs and those who are just undergoing training were trained at the Bridge.
In addition to the standard training to uncover sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for a lost figurant, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter arrives, the dog can go to work, so that he has no problem traveling by helicopter.
"So far, the helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," Tomášek said.
A dog who is restless or unable to start working immediately after a helicopter journey is disqualified from training.
“Most of them are then left by dogs, for example, in the garden,” added Tomášek.
The police have 76 dogs of different specialties.
German shepherds are predominant, but Belgian shepherds are also increasing.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is raising him himself, preparing him for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomášek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and unhealthy, he passes the first tests in 20 months.
"It takes about two and a half to three years to get into a sharp intervention," added Tomášek.
The length of service depends on the health of the dog.
It usually lasts for eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Narcos season 3 trailer: Pablo Escobar is out of play and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix’s hit series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is uncovered, the Netflix series is far from ending.
The confirmation from the streaming service has already been received for the third and fourth seasons - the first has already been confirmed by the first trailer and a list of other negative characters.
In the third season, DEA focuses on the world’s richest drug cartel: the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential masters, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company,” with the only difference being that they escalate violence and pay more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
UN says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
The elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, a UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, a senior UN Relief Mission official, said hundreds of women participated in local parliamentary elections, three women are running for vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women participate in them, as well as in all related processes related to the elections.
Presidential and local elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban has issued a number of threats against the electoral process, which is shifting international fighting to the other corner.
This year, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government has handed over its power to a peacefully succeeding government.
Haysom said that a strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewer makes beer again.
A good beer in a rebuilt brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lobč u Mšena back to life a few years ago.
The brewery first mentioned in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt to steam operation.
It was followed by years of flourishing, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
During World War II, the production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the building has served as a state ship.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope shone in the form of new owners, architects Jan and Pavel Prouzov.
They started repairing the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves and devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the building became part of the European Routes of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was renewed.
If you want to taste the great lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokořínska, visit the brewery.
During the brewing of beer, they use the Kokorin water originating in the protected landscape area, the salad from the lobby fields and the harvest hemp.
You can taste the traditional light bed, but also dark beers and specials.
And don’t miss a tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and in the second half.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia.
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
The unique construction was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and Žacléř, on the top of the terrain over the village of Babí.
It originally consisted of twelve bunkers connected by an extensive underground.
There was to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammunition warehouses, materials, a power plant, a machinery and a hospital.
The Munich Agreement ended.
In less than a year, the only huge iron concrete bunker was built and the underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of Stachelberg, who began reconstructing the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also visit this place.
The underground is available at 75 percent.
In addition to the infantry wing T-S 73 with exposure and underground, the site includes an armed object of light fortification, two unbuilt infantry wings, canyons and the nautical path of the Fortress of Trutnovsk.
Fresh food, a cozy terrace and stunning views of the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and magnificent Czech building has been listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian’s port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chotěšov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today forms mainly a powerful four-winged building of the Convent above a magnificent garden.
The list, which it got to, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of disappearance.
But the enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next year’s Evening for the Chotěšov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where, among others, Vladimír Mišík, Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see shermer performances and you will look at the places of the magnificent vast building, which are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this wonderful place.

Discover the plant with one click.
Students with the creation of herbaries and ordinary lovers of plants will be helped by the new free application Pl@ntNet.
When they are wondering what kind of plant they’ve just stumbled upon on a walk, this app will help them.
All they have to do is photograph the plant and the app will recognize what species it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education CEEV in Bratislava Horský Park in the framework of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who together with teachers photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application’s database.
The newly created French app is free to download from the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French programmers was to get as many people as possible to contribute to the app with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the app can recognize.
“Already children who hold a tablet or a mobile phone in their hands can go to the forest,” said Ivana Poláčková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which then in Czech and Slovak will be assigned under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the app into Slovak and Czech for the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute with an image of a plant that is not yet found in the database after creating an account in the application.
“The French will assess whether it is beneficial, and then add it to the database,” Poláčková said.
GMB worries about investment in McVitie's Glasgow factory
The trade unions are demanding assurances from the managers of McVitie’s cookie manufacturer about the long-term commitment of the production at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company has been silent about a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said it has invested more than £5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives will be “among the first to be informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the company’s construction manager, GMB’s Scottish unions expressed concerns that McVitie’s “will not meet its promises of financing and upgrading its production lines.”
GMB Chief Organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear answer from the construction manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the employees are mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work at the factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in areas from high unemployment and social exclusion.
From the point of view of labor, wages and profitability — and despite the outlook for Brexit, rising cost of living and falling slow production — the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately thriving producer like McVitie’s.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross received a letter from GMB yesterday and the company will make a statement as soon as possible as we value the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to our employees that as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “Over the past few years, we have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area, in production lines and operational efficiency.
We highly value the heritage of Tollcross and the site, and in case of any changes in the operation of the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately.”
PSG warned Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t allow in their attempt to get Neymar on their side after making a £189 million deposit, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but has this French team warned Barcelona of their record-breaking attack three years ago?
Ligue 1 is ready to beat more than twice the previous record amount for Paul Pogba's transfer to Manchester United, which paid £89 million for him last season.
After confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after taxation, he will receive over £500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar withdrew from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club that would be interested in taking over one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we’ll definitely reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences.”
It seems that Barcelona has crossed the imaginary boundary when it expressed interest in PSG defender Marco Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the Italian player to leave under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill with Neymar’s departure.
Who explains the sanctions?
Does political punishment have widespread rules?
Donald Trump rejects anti-Russian sanctions.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And the day before, Trump wrote that China is not doing anything with the North Korean threat and that it will not go on.
The idea of sanctions is like a slam from the boots.
These things cannot be thrown into a single bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela is really on its way to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is just not acting as the US president would like.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to summarize this so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, would understand what the sanctions policy consists of and what the system of rules is based on, the task would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only tells what President Obama has already planned, he has only given the implementation stamp.
Why such agitation?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the US election, he would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
A terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not being eased, but are being tightened.
Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
Could it be that the sanctions were approved by the UN Security Council?
There are no EU sanctions or anti-Russian sanctions.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has complained that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Are sanctions so weak that they do not endanger anyone?
The ordinary voter.
He has heard for three years that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
It is now known that this is an issue of EU energy security.
Voting is wider and wider.
Russia is being sanctioned for being too much where it is not.
China is scorned by the fact that it makes very little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All of these punishments or only considerations have their rationality.
Does anyone see a rule or a rule?
Andrei Babiš: I do not consider working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš married, crossed the republic with his visionary book and finalised the electoral program.
In addition to the parliament, all candidates have already been elected.
According to him, he did not interfere with them.
He even agreed that this Moravskoslezskaya should be led by the head of state and shadow minister of education of ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"If he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member of parliament or a lieutenant," Babiš said.
Many representatives and national politicians have been upset by their thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should manage municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Do you mean seriously?
It was not.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we are directly electing the president and I am convinced that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book I am not talking about disturbances, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
During the presentation of your book What I Dream When I Accidentally Sleep, I heard on my own ears that you talked about the cancellation of representation.
I do not remember.
I was talking about direct elections and a reduction in the number of representatives.
With nine million inhabitants, New York has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 deputies.
And the mayor is blamed for building little and not preparing large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same applies to the government, which in our history was ruled by only two people, Klaus and Zeman.
I’m not saying they did it well.
The Prime Minister is not moderating the debate, he is moderating the debate.
This cannot work.
Do you want a majority system?
It would be ideal, but it would be hard to implement.
On the agenda is a change to the Senate.
We have also proposed a moving mandate of ministers and an adjustment of the Rules of Procedure of the House to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of deputies, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to show up at parliamentary meetings.
It is not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
This is what your opponents fear.
That as a dictator you will rule the government, control the House of Commons with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will rule the whole country.
It is not.
There is nothing wrong with the number of members.
French President Macron has announced the reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57 thousand French people per legislature, while in France it is based on 17 thousand Czechs.
But nobody accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic won the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making any dramatic changes.
For those who have a majority in parliament, it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the movement.
We just need a team in government that will work for the people, not for their parties or resorts.
I don’t understand why we didn’t agree on raising the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services.
Why did they override me and add 21 percent to the members of GIBS, who already take 60,000?
Would you like to do that as prime minister?
The prime minister has to intervene when ministers behave inexpensively, confuse the government with a travel agency and for the money of the state would like to do business like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers should not argue within the government, they should argue outside it.
In the cabinet must go ready material, there is no place for coalition break-ups, force voting and business, there is to decide.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers are mostly party-oriented?
There is a constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and drove Babiše out of government.
Every prime minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has managerial abilities, such a plank gesture is not needed.
It measures everyone equally and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would nominate for Finance Minister?
I don’t think about it at all, because we probably won’t be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even though I don’t know what I’ve done so horrible.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayors have acquired the entrepreneur Grandpa who would like to cooperate with you, and the people may win the wing of Jiří Čunka who is inclined to you.
I do not think.
ČSSD leads Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not rule out a coalition with ANO, in the ODS may be pushed by Václav Klaus Jr., who will also not be against.
I leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomio Okamura, for example, in the area of economy.
Are they considered as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn’t say that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, he candidated as a puppet of Víta Bárty for VV, then earned money for his company from the dawn, there was a coup.
He is of course a distinct personality.
A bit brown.
If I take his program, there is a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, that can be agreed with.
I do not ask you about that at all.
I wonder if it is acceptable for you to be a person who has xenophobic opinions, speaks at demonstrations and wants to leave the EU?
We don’t think about working with Mr. Okamura, I can’t imagine it.
He went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I don’t know, but voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the other in sequence, but God knows who will be the winner and who the two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on the coalition government agenda.
Let’s go back to your attempt to manage the state as a company.
But the government simply has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka has let everything go away, never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his doll, and I think that’s why he fired me.
As soon as he did, he controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister has delivered a resolution written by the management of the ČEZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how to vote at the general meeting of the ČEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff in the Supervisory Board and change the top management of CEZ?
If I’m the prime minister, I’ll see.
I am not yet.
It is rumored that it has already sent signals in your direction.
I would like to exchange a good deal for an even better one.
After the election, everything will go on.
I know nothing about it.
I don’t have any humble or pink lobbyists, I’m a separate unit and I don’t deal with this at all.
Answer directly.
If you become the head of government, will you seek to replace the leadership of ČEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions you criticize?
We want a transparent society.
For years, he has done what he wants, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
Let’s look at Mr Schwarzenberg’s comments.
Although he has to be in the CEZ majority, he never led him, he was there only in number, which is wrong.
This is a trivial matter for me.
ČEZ is to take Dukovany, value them, put them in a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or find a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her programs are running a permanent targeted campaign against me, but I don’t have and will not have any competence to throw anyone out.
To control yes.
I do not want to control anyone.
I just say that citizens pay about 7.2 billion per year for public broadcasting and television fees, but they don’t actually know how these institutions manage.
Why do they not know?
The House is approving a report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the CST and CST.
Look at how the news is being discussed, the superpower pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary commission on leaks from investigative files and to lex Babiš.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalousk push me out of the government, which played a TOP 09 percentage, but the ČSSD took it.
They fear disruption of their corrupt system, so they talk about threatening democracy by Babiš.
No one is immune.
What do you say about the articles describing how the first deputy chairman of ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek builds his power background by placing his son in the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts for his relative lawyer Květoslavo Hlín with city and state firms, such as Prague Transportation Enterprise or Czech Railways?
We have an ongoing dispute.
I don’t like it and have blamed him for it several times.
Faltýnek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at substantially lower rates and is reliable.
I’t behave like that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelta, no Kratochvílov, no Březina.
If there were any signs of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like that happens, we’ll get rid of anyone, it doesn’t matter who it is.
