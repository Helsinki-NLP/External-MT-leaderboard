How sweet!
When I'm in a bad mood, I start singing.

I think you like him.
This magazine costs only two pounds, including delivery.
I'll miss you.
I sat on the bench next to Tom.
They love each other.
Come by tomorrow.
What insects did you eat?
I saw Tom get hit by a car.
Tom can go.
Tell me where the wine is.
You can do this.
I'm very sorry to hear that.
I know what a stapler looks like.
I can't confirm that.
Mary will guarantee it.
I got on the wrong bus.
I declined the offer.
Mary has already done what she had to do.
I watched Tom.
Did you reserve a table?
Where'd the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use all of them.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not wealthy.
I didn't think you would understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about we go on a picnic?
We couldn't buy concert tickets until we got money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom isn't very good at tennis.
I am a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
Tom needs you here.
We ran out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in the country cannot enjoy the village life.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, a Coke and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There's a problem with my account.
Tom gladly agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Are you all right?
You may be the only one who can do it.
Who's wrong?
Your singing makes professional singers blush with shame.
You know Tom is lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom is a jerk.
He was great.
Tom knows that Mary didn't do it.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
I was bitten by a dog last week.
Do you want me to ask him?
Tom and I aren't afraid of Mary.
Try the paddles!
You're lucky to have such a good job.
What do you have in your hand?
We are busy.
It's time for dinner.
It's unlikely that Tom will forget how to do that.
Do you drink?
Will Tom do that with you?
Are you awake?
The meeting began at five o'clock.
Mary said she likes to do that.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew Mary wasn't busy.
I've only been to Tokyo once.
I got an electric bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary so much.
I wonder why Tom was planning to do that.
The attendance of all members is mandatory.
Are you uncomfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree too.
I was lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who are you planning on doing this with?
We're happy with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sami will find out.
A witness who saw the whole thing with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who heard it all.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is finished.
When I entered the room, she was playing the piano.
You are very kind.
Where are your manners?
They did not give up hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom ironed his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We should call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party was going?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn't want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
Okay, I'll have a bite.
I don't want any more.
Do you know what colors she likes?
I don't think Tom will be here today.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you are.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She began to play an old song.
Why are they speaking French?
That's not true.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
Spring is coming.
She speaks two foreign languages.
It's too much.
Tom says that I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back to the beginning.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We have to invent a secret language.
Are you planning to stay long?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My children are at school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you'd like to buy?
I am old.
I'm thinking of you.
I was just doing my job.
Where did all these machines come from?
I live in a giant bucket.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn't know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I'm a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Tom speaks French quite fluently.
John captured a tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it out myself.
Tom wiped his face with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
This is a bracelet.
I have plenty of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need facts.
She couldn't defend herself.
Tom is leaving Boston next month.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss each other.
Millions of people die from hunger every year.
I was wondering what Tom wanted.
The letter had the wrong address.
This is the last train.
Who will fight?
I found a meteorite.
I'm not happy at all.
It's all in chocolate.
They have converted to another religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He is a strange person.
I just got my hair cut.
Mary said she'd never learned French.
I'm thinking about buying a new car.
We are to blame.
You are so sweet.
It'll cost about fifteen dollars.
I knocked on the door.
His theory is worth considering.
We're ashamed of Tom.
Help came too late.
This is not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.
I wrote these books myself.
She is a tennis player.
That's how Tom became famous.
You had a good time, didn't you?
You were singing.
I did everything perfectly.
I like to write.
Kyoto is an exceptionally beautiful city.
I'm going to be sixteen next month.
Do you think there's a chance that's going to happen?
Face your dreams.
What time will your last lesson be over?
I came to say goodbye, Tom.
I like this dog.
I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn't tired.
Tom and Mary are doing that.
We have to help Tom.
It's been a long day.
I was upset about it.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom will go to Boston.
Who said you could do that?
Why did you buy the flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Keep your voice down.
The sun shines by day, and the moon by night.
I got a hard-on for her.
You were right earlier.
I hope Tom can help us.
You have the right to be happy.
What's your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
This is a banana.
Tom is likely to be punished for what he did.
Mary is your girlfriend?
London was covered in fog.
I'm very glad you're here, Tom.
Tom is weak.
I told Tom to come to Australia.
Do you usually travel abroad?
You have to be flexible.
I believe you will win.
She went to the airport to see him off.
Get out of here.
He's in the kitchen.
Please, please, please.
They won't tell us.
Work slowly
The capital of Brazil is Brasília.
What I really want is to sleep.
I still have to pay my phone bill.
Tom knows how to cook.
But the music makes him nervous.
What languages are spoken in America?
You deserve to rest.
These are fresh.
Tom has huge eyes.
The merry-go-round has seven colors.
I don't think Tom should be doing this.
He is grim today.
I wish we could spend more time together.
Listen to his honest opinion.
Aren't you on duty tonight?
Tom has never had to learn much.
How's your wife, Tom?
I accept your offer.
Bill has many friends.
That would be unfair.
It's either you or Jane that's going to go there.
If I were you, I'd ignore it.
Tom will be here right now.
These are the most expensive shoes I've ever seen.
It's a Greek name.
Do you think I'm joking around?
I was very tired today.
I'm being truthful.
Happiness does not come from owning many things.
The news spread throughout Japan.
Tom pointed to the side of the mountain.
The taxi is here.
I heard him come down the stairs.
This is mine.
How wonderful!
Can you read Cyrillic?
I know Tom pretty well.
I shouldn't have come here.
Tom is neat, isn't he?
I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you something for me?
I would never have been able to do it without your help.
I always have coffee and greens for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.
I'm the best one.
How did your exam go?
Can I pay later?
Did that just happen?
Mary didn't bring an umbrella with her.
Did you hear me?
In truth, I did not tell the truth.
I'm going to bed!
He doesn't like eggs.
I found the money.
I don't understand why he did that.
They are all tourists.
Can I borrow some tweezers?
It's your life.
Tom said he wanted a drink.
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she didn't do that.
Patrick doesn't know how to write.
I was too shy.
I went into detail.
Tom said he didn't want to do that.
Let's go to the oceanarium.
Do you know what the problem is?
Where is Boston?
I need your opinion.
Don't worry. She doesn't understand German.
Is she hiding something?
Tom said he was interested.
I have a good appetite today.
We are comfortable in our new home.
There are only two things in the world that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity. I can't be sure about the first.
She said: "I am very happy".
Tom is interesting to talk to.
You reap what you sow.
What were you looking at?
Can we go faster? I'm running late.
We're not just football players.
All the meat is rotten.
I was born that way.
Tom and I were running at the track.
He came home late at night.
The UK's National Health Service has today updated its coronavirus advisory.
You're going to have to do it.
Tom and I drink the same thing.
He could not resist the urge to smoke another cigarette.
There's a secret passage.
I don't want to argue with you.
Let me in.
She's unconscious.
I thought Tom would refuse to do that.
I love you all.
What floor do you live on?
Tom was a bit confused.
He signed a check.
Hi, how are you?
The password is "Muiriel".
Did you hear what Tom said?
Tom reads novels.
Take out the trash.
You're my friend.
He has two cars.
They realized.
It's all right!
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
Can I borrow your scissors?
Thank her for her help.

Sami is a smart dog.
I can't delete the photos from the camera!
I was shocked to learn that I had won.
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she should do that.
All dogs are animals. But that doesn't mean all animals are dogs.
People who can think of only one way to spell a word obviously lack imagination.
I'm sure he'll succeed.
Tom didn't do that.
Where is the nearest subway station?

You're not hiding anything?
How are you?

I think you've said enough.
I'm the customer.
I'm very greedy.
You are crazy.
Tom won't bother Mary anymore.
Just answer it now.
I had a suspicion that Tom was homesick.
Tom hasn't done that since last year.
Are you done complaining?
Aren't you Mary's husband?
Do they speak English?
No one has seen Tom.
The police continued their investigation.
I think I know what Tom would do.

Let me have a cigarette.
You're just a guy.
She has big tits.
We are cool.

Hurry up, and you'll catch the train.
It could be cancer.
I wonder if Tom will actually do that.
I don't like ice cream.
I don't want to sell the car.
I just want to measure it.

Where's your teddy bear?
How are you, Tom?
Maybe this year we'll finally win the Eurovision.
Where could Tom do that?
I think you're wrong.
I'm being careful.
Do you have a passport?
I managed to forget my wallet.
Cats are hunting mice.
You can go.
Tom said he wouldn't mind doing that for Mary.
Where's Tom going?
I'll call them myself.
I made Tom do that.
Why would Tom want to do that?
Birds can see the Earth's magnetic field with their eyes.
Do you need a car?
This is Tom's signature.
What really happened here?
Oh, my God!
I'm not wearing anything.
Are you planning on doing that somehow?
Am I making myself clear?
I'm free this afternoon.
Tom is probably being punished for doing that.
No matter what, Tom is happy.
There's no need to rush.
Are you satisfied?
At first I didn't believe him.
The phone is not working now.
Tom is with his friends.
What were we afraid of?
Please come in!
Get in there.
Tom could be fined if he does that.
I know you're not an idiot.
I am the strongest.
That's really crazy.
Tom is my older brother.
Tom told Mary that he had seen John in January.
You always get up early, don't you?
She keeps contradicting herself.
They live in the same state.
My dog follows me wherever I go.
Thank you for your help.
Tom said he didn't want to die.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Tom is already studying French.
The land was passed down from father to son.
There is no rose without its thorn.
I hope it's not them.
Don't drink too much, all right?
You're in for a surprise tonight.
You'll never be alone.
Why should we not do so?
There's nothing to celebrate.
I like to watch TV.
He left his family.
Are we going?
You shouldn't get involved with Tom.
I shaved.
I'm the boss.
Tom did well.
You have to be back home by nine o'clock.
Tom and Mary danced all night.
Tom admitted that he did that.
Tom can't drive a car.
Tom spent the day with his daughter.
Each student has his own desk.
We were ready.
I'm worried about being sued.
My family lives here.
Tom is listening.
I got away with it.
Tom speaks French well.
I know I'm learning a lot.
I went fishing on Monday.
Mary loved her dog.
The party's over.
The unicycle has one wheel.
"Daddy, look there, the shark!" "It's a whale, Tom".
I know you're hiding something.
People always say I'm very nice.
I'm a botanist.
I think Tom knows something.
It was my mistake, not Tom's.
The meeting went quite well.
The wind blows from the ocean this time of year.
I saw Tom smile.
Come on, let's get out of here!
I am sure he is an honest man.
Tom has a surprise for Mary.
I never mentioned it.
Go and kill that punk.
This is our car.
Hi, this is Bashir!
Tom bought Mary a rose.
I'm ashamed that I did that.
Do I need to go to the hospital?
In her spare time, she makes dolls.
I think Tom sings country music better than anyone I know.
He drinks a moderate amount of coffee.
What does Tom want to do?
I can't pay them today.
She doesn't care what she's wearing.
Have you seen his new movie?
I'm good at that.
Why did he resign?
Tom said that Mary had left.
I don't have enough money to buy this.
Mary said that she wasn't sick.
If you want.
We have suppliers.
My unbiased opinion is that it's a terrible movie.
You are very elegant.
As you wish.
I could change.
This is important.
Are you trying to be funny again?
Tom doesn't trust us.
Tom has it.
Tom was barefoot.
I did everything I could.
If you see a mistake, please correct it.
We tried again, but we failed.
I wanted to talk to my lawyer.
I'm not sure I'm ready to do that.
I think Tom and Mary are right.
You must help her.
You can't cry your way out of a bad situation.
He did his homework by himself.
It was a hot day.
I need a vacation.
We want to climb that mountain.
Tom missed his lunch.
You speak English well.
He loved his parents.
Let me go talk to Tom.
Tom isn't very organized, is he?
I'm looking for someone who speaks French.
How often do you do this?
I hope you'll come back.
Tom wants to be a baseball player.
Love cannot be bought.
If you didn't want to come, you should have said something.
I'm ready to work.
What theater is this?
Did you see the bee?
Mary said that Tom told her.
Tom wasn't a very good witness.
I went to visit my grandmother.
I hate weddings.
I heard the front door slam.
I can't keep up with you.
Mary is a wonderful dancer.
My grandfather is from Osaka.
I want a massage. I need to relax.
Tom is such a lucky guy.
Why are you doing this, Tom?
I think so.
Did you get any sleep?
I was very sincere.
I'm not sure who did it.
What do you think Tom will be here?
Is it going to snow tonight?
Does it interest you?
Are you seeing anyone?
I live in Milan.
When has she ever done anything for me?
I ate an orange.
The square root of two  is an irrational number.
He's small.
Didn't you know this would happen?
Bad thoughts lead to bad actions.
With a tennis fan?
Tom is not wrong.
Do you have a return on this bill?
Tom seems a little embarrassed.
We can't do without water.
I can't get my head together.
Tom came to talk to Mary.
She lives in the village.
I would never give up.
I speak French fluently.
Tom didn't waste time on that.
Knock me down.
You are disgusting.
I think I could help them.
I'm going to work.
He is very drunk.
Tom claims that he's satisfied.
How do you feel now?
How many boys are there in your class?
These are big apples.
Choose your gift carefully.
I'm going with her.
Why would you do something like that?
The richest man in the world could not buy her love.
Where did they go?
What do you want from me?
I need new tires.
No news is good news.
Why are you late this morning?
Computers save us a lot of time.
Don't interrupt what we're saying.
You're obviously sick.
You've been to London three times.
I will be back.
Tom didn't see you.
I walk slowly.
After the movie, they went to sleep.
I started coughing.
We'll get married in June.
I wonder if Tom left Boston.
I threw the dice.
The book was missing a few pages.
I picked up a coin.
I have to go to a meeting.
Tom never breaks his promise.
We have to protect ourselves.
You know Jamal and Sara don't get along.
Each student has his own desk.
I spent twelve hours on the train.
I'll regret this later.
I'm not convinced that Tom is telling the truth.
It's none of your business.
Do not go.
Tom is not hungry.
I learned to milk a cow.
I'm fed up.
I wish I were rich.
The news made her very sad.
I have plenty of time.
Happy new year!
You'll see for yourself.
I never killed anyone.
How do you pronounce your name?
She holds flowers in her hand.
Have you talked to him yet?
We're used to it.
The old man is over 90 years old.
This coffee is so hot that I can't drink it.
Where'd you get this?
Are we finished?
Are you from Boston?
You've known her since 1990?
You're good at this, aren't you?
These apples are delicious.
Can I take your coat?
I don't share your optimism.
Tom is special.
You're not a doctor.
I was afraid to say no.
She has red blood.
What's wrong?
I owe you ten dollars.
Listening to music is my favorite way to relax.
We were ready to attack.
When is the celebration?
Did you help?
Are you a cop?
Tom didn't do anything we told him to do.
You didn't see him.
I know that Tom has told us a lie.
Tom heard that Mary got married.
I learned a lot.
How much is this umbrella?
They both grew up.
What's wrong?
It can be done.
Tom thinks Mary is exhausted.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
Everyone in Tom's class got the flu.
Do you remember the first time you heard the Beatles?
Is Tom hurt?
I want you to come to my party.
There's no toilet paper.
Speak is silver, silence is gold.
Please sit here and wait.
I love this shirt.
Drink water from the stream.
I'm usually busier than Tom.
I moved last month.
Tom must still be angry.
I'll go to the airport.
Don't listen to her whims.
I'm glad Tom is going to help us.
Tom will be here any minute.
I'm glad they're both on our team.
Where can we get off?
Do you like chocolate milk?
I always keep my word.
How long does it take?
Tom, are you all right?
She's a bad student.
I'm sure Tom and I will see each other again.
He suspected nothing.
I asked her out.
Are you Japanese?
Tom looks scared.
When did you arrive in China?
Do you approve of what Tom is doing?
Tom showed Mary the house.
It's nice to meet you, Tom.
This is the perfect opportunity!
I wonder if Tom told Mary that she had to do that.
I don't expect them to win.
I fell asleep.
How is it my fault?
About Switzerland, have you ever been there in winter?
I didn't know Tom knew French.
It got better.
I am learning the Vietnamese language.
I'm going to meet Tom.
Tom wanted to pay off the loan.
Try to look at it from Tom's point of view.
The window opened.
No one thinks so.
I took off my shoes.
Help me with this.
Tom couldn't find a place to park.
You will be happy.
Tom looked pretty sore the last time I saw him.
Is Tom still dating Mary?
You didn't even smile.
Have you ever been to Madrid?
You think you're funny?
I usually work from nine to five.
Let me do it with you.
Mary watched a romantic comedy.
Get him!
Someone knocked on Tom's door.
Tom is such an asshole.
Would you like some more mashed potatoes?
Tom was sitting.
Tom has a beard.
I have three questions for you.
I have met Tom a few times.
Do you use a word processor?
Tom and Mary do a lot of things together.
Please move.
What are you doing tonight?
Why did you paint the bench red?
No, it's not my house.
You speak French fluently, right?
As you wish.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
You can't speak French, can you?
You're not like that.
Let's go home now.
I said hello to Tom.
Tom took off his wedding ring.
I'll arrange breakfast for you.
Tom was listening.
Who broke this window?
Your ideas are a bit outdated.
