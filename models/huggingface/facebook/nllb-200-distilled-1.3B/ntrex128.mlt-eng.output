AMs from Wales are afraid of being seen as a fool
There is consternation among some AMs following a suggestion that their title should be changed to MWPs (Member of Parliament for Wales).
This was raised because of plans to change the name of the assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
MAs across the political spectrum are concerned that this will make them appear ridiculous .
AM Labour said his group was concerned that it sounded like Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In the Welsh language  twp means fool and pwp means fool.
Plaid's AM said that the whole group was not happy and suggested alternatives.
A Conservative from Wales said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but noted that there was a slight verbal difference from MWP to Muppet.
In this context the letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the pronunciation of the letter e.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, said: The final decision on any descriptor of  what Members of the Assembly should be called will of course be a matter for the members themselves.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 empowered the Welsh assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the widely supported proposals to call the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the title of AMs, the Commission favoured Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but MWP received the most support in a public consultation.
It appears that the AMs are suggesting alternative options, but the difficulty in reaching consensus could be a headache for the Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of  AMs and the design of the committee system.
AMs will have the final vote on the question of what to call when they have a debate on legislation.
In Macedonia, public opinion is left in the hands of a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set up with the aim of finding a solution to a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on what the name of its northern neighbor represents .
President of Macedonia Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a consequence of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells stop ringing as churches in Harlem are being dismantled
"Historically, the elders I spoke to say there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr Adams.
Today, there is none".
He said he could understand how the bars disappeared.
He said, "People are socializing differently" today.
"The bars are no longer the centre of local activity where people go on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders think, and will end up back where they started".
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment blocks with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the rest of the local shrines.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he said, "and so they won't be disappointed when the day comes for these churches to close because it is likely that many of these people who come to live in these condos will not become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem became a white metropolis - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original Methodist Congregation of white people left in the 1930s.
A congregation of black people practicing the nearby religion took title to the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a congregation of black people under the Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted the hiring or promotion of black people.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, was proud to call the carillon "the people's bell".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it something else: "cultural treasure" and "unique historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to have a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's was no different from anyone else.
What has happened at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated story of experts and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders, others from the Episcopal dioceses.
The vestry - the parish governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese would seek to pass on the costs to the vestry, although the vestry was not involved in hiring the experts and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while he's fishing for oysters in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was taking a bath in California on the opening day of the fall season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. at Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was playing with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then went to the rescue with a group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the excitement of catching a fever, but then he realised he was screaming, "Serve me!"
You hurt me!'
Cut him and open the whole clavicle", Hammel said realizing the moment he reached the boy.
"A cry for everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The shark species responsible for the attack was not known.
Lifeguard Capt. Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security purposes.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
 Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing against Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with shelf corridors similar to those of a beauty department store with specialist assistants.
As part of substantial revenue in the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow as sales of clothing and home goods decline, larger corridors with beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and the idea will be rolled out to more stores next year if successful.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets were looking for ways to use shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwaves and household goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double the amount of beauty goods it is offering to 3000 items, including firms such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing product ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will have more space in branded areas similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range to make the majority of products vegan-friendly - something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will examine concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, while the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food daily in local convenience stores means that supermarkets are having to do more to persuade people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury's, said stores will increasingly look like "department stores" as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food product.
Sainsbury's has been placing Argos stores in store categories and has also introduced a number of Habitats since it bought both chains two years ago, which it says has boosted merchandise sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over how to share the revenue from the grocery stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold the £281 store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million, three years ago.
He said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare firms including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsburys, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit every need and the attractive environment and convenient store locations mean that we have become a destination for beauty products of interest that challenge the old way of shopping".
Peter Jones 'very angry' after Holly Willoughby cancelled a £11 million deal
Peter Jones' Dragons personality 'very angry' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home products and accessories brand, Truly.
The pair business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's firm, Goop.
The This Morning presenter, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons personality Den Peter Jones very upset that she cancelled being part of their business of a high-earning last-minute lifestyle firm - to focus on her big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "very angry" when the hugely popular television personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his small business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that its new deals - worth up to £1.5m - meant there was not enough time left to dedicate to their home products and accessories firm, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop firm and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
As Willoughby, 37, appeared on Instagram to announce she was leaving with Truly, Jones left Britain and went to one of his private villagers.
A source said: "Truly was by far Holly's first priority.
It was to be her long-term future that would fill her for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave left everyone completely surprised.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was almost here.
There is a stockpile of product at Marlow's headquarters that is ready for sale".
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning presenter, who is among Britain's most profitable personalities, could mean a cost of millions to the company due to a large investment in products from candles and candles to clothing and household goods, and the potential for further delays to its launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couples travel together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as presenter of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night, a source close to  Jones said "We don't comment on his economic affairs".
A Difficult Meeting 'But Then We Found Love'
He joked about criticism he would receive from the news media for making a comment some people would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give in so easily?
Trump said in a voice that imitated that of a news anchor".
"I gave up nothing".
He noted that Kim is interested in another meeting after Trump boasted that their initial meeting in Singapore in June was a big step towards North Korea's denuclearisation.
But the denuclearisation negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea would not see a "corresponding response" from the United States to early steps of North Korea's disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the US is pushing ahead with sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
He said, "We're doing well with North Korea".
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were being killed.
Now we have this very good relationship".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results - the end of rocket tests, assistance in the release of hostages and the return of American veterans who had remained back home.
And he defended his unusual approach while talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake in Indonesia Destroy Island, Kill Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that they were not needed.
Even after more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, it was very clear that they were not asking for international assistance, so it is a challenge", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is organising a team to travel to Palu, it is unclear whether foreign personnel can operate on site.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Considering that Indonesia experiences frequent earthquakes, the country is still not well prepared for the great fury of nature.
While a tsunami shelter has been built in Aceh, you rarely see them along the coast.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite an alert being issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of times, travel between Indonesia's numerous islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics more complicated.
A hospital ship was stationed in Lombok to treat the victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's crumbling infrastructure, the center of his election campaign, and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's administration has been crushed by a lack of funds as he faces re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of this faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other types of weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool brings the points to the same in the last minute vs Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was 27 yards away from Chelsea's goal as his team were losing 1-0.
He hit the ball slightly to his left before shooting the ball into the net.
The ball  up a lot from the box as it ended up in the right side of the  up the net.
Eventually, the ball landed behind Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped to try to catch it, and fell into the net.
"I was trying to get into that position, to get into the ball and players like Shaq always send him forward as much as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming at me and I touched the ball once and didn't think much about it and tried to shoot the ball".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 into the half after a goal in the 25th minute from the very good Belgian player Eden Hazard.
The Chelsea striker handed the ball back to Mateo Kovacic, before he went running towards the midfield and then quickly into Liverpool's midfield.
Kovacic delivered the ball quickly in the middle of the field.
He then shot the ball very beautifully, which brought Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and sent the ball into the net with his left foot and passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday afternoon in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia's tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were reportedly trapped under the rubble of the building that collapsed due to Friday's 7.5 magnitude quake that caused waves up to 20 feet high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in rubble from the collapse.
Police arrest a man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am this morning with knife wounds at Grayson Mews in John Street, by a 32-year-old man who has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged people in the area who saw or heard something to speak up.
Investigative detective Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in the early stages but I appeal to anyone who has been in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, particularly taxi drivers, who may have caught something on the dashcam footage to contact us as they may have information that is vital to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside property.
This afternoon friends who think they know the woman arrived on the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still ongoing as police said they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to re-enter his apartment but is being informed by the police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he became aware of a tree.

Cromwell's statue of Parliament becomes the latest monument to be touched by the argument about rewriting history
Her removal would be a form of  appropriate justice for the destruction in a similar fashion to that of the Taliban, of many of the English religious and cultural artifacts carried out by its fanatical  Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the present debate over the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the evil Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent depiction of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure many believe is still to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament against outside pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual figure who is recognized as representing one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated".
Killer Pig Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a severed, blood-stained artery near a mat in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a hoggery on 30 May 2005 in Xining of Qinghai Province, China.
Allegedly, he travelled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of  Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered a door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that inside the shell was a pig with blood on it.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had attacked and killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodied and mutilated", said the cousin, who referred to him by his nickname "Wu", as quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was restrained from attacking others, while police gathered evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg was kept by a Welsh farmer with his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After a pig from an Oregon farmer attacked and ate him in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but the taste of blood can act as a "cause".
"They're playing.
They work, they're very curious... they don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to show them the appropriate amount of respect", he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will bring heavy rainfall to the southeastern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring floodwaters across northern Mexico and the southeastern United States in the coming days.
Rosa brought 85 mph winds, a Category 1 hurricane, at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, it is forming a trough over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm it will begin pushing strong tropical moisture northward into the western United States
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain in parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching trough will create heavy rainfall spread over the South-East in the coming days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerously rapid flooding, debris flows and the possibility of desert avalanches.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates to approach 2 to 3 inches per hour in parts, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain are expected in parts of the West, especially over much of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible with conditions rapidly deteriorating due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is not a good idea to go out in the desert on foot under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become dangerous rivers and storms will bring very local winds and dust.
The trough will bring some rain to parts of the Southern California coast.
Total rainfall of more than half an inch is possible, which can cause small flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the region's first rain of their rainy season.
Some tropical rain showers begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain spread across Four Corners on Tuesday and continued until Wednesday.
October may see some sharp temperature changes across the US as the Arctic cools, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There will be a big example of dramatic temperature differences from the US Centre on Sunday.
There is almost a 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to develop and spread again.
Much of Central and Eastern America is expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures in the 80s spread from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northwest.
New York City could get up to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast is indicating high possibilities for above-average temperatures for the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched Thursday's highly entertaining testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political fight continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular programming with shocking last-minute news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent certain that Kavanaugh abused her while under the influence of alcohol and tried to strip her during a post-secondary-level party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday saw it.
The company was averaging the amount of viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other networks that showed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen generally finds it difficult to calculate how many viewers are from offices.
To put this into perspective, it is an audience size similar to that for a deciding football game or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose viewers strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, topped all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daylong hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was right behind him with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, protesters caught him on camera on CNN and CBS on Friday morning shouting at him as he tried to climb the elevator to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood there with his eyes down for several minutes as he was being aggressively criticized, live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to a country?
They said, "You have power when most women have nothing".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying, before the elevator doors closed, he would have more to say at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were live-streaming, hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee the following week, which the Democratic minorities have long been urging.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was powerful, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of taking advantage of Brexit policy
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of taking advantage of politics and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In one interview after another with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson expressed his attack of the so-called 'Chequers' Plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs was "completely insane".
Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson after LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on a charge of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, reports CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His bond was set at $350,000, reports The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner's office issued a preliminary report on Friday, which said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department credits the Louisiana State Police's homicide task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and area citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletics director Joe Alleva thanked area law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "lost" and "shocked" after Wayde's death.
"That's what you worry about all the time", Wade said.
Volcano shoots ash on Mexico City
Ash spewing from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after activity in the craters increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring various sounds and tectonic movements.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash smoldering through car windshields in Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity at the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with separatists from Catalonia ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police, and as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held back by riot police were doused with eggs and dust paints, creating a cloud of dark dust on the roads usually crowded with tourists.
There were also small clashes during the day and the police had to use the lights to control the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not apologize" to fight unionist demonstrators who chanted, "Spain Forever".
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries received in the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the independence-seeking region a year after the October 1 referendum deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists from Catalonia.
Voters chose by a large margin to become independent, although turnout was low with those opposed to secession boycotting the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were killed last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped out overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was carried out but had to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope in the prospects of Catalonia gaining independence.
"Last year was one of our best.
I saw my mother and father crying for the joy of having voted but now we are gone", he said.
Despite a vital and narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties are looking to maintain momentum this year with many of their best known leaders either in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial because of their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest on his phone in support of the police, said the clash was caused by politicians on both sides.
"There is more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"By standing as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashed into house with force
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car broke into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 BST.
Investigative detective Bob Blemmings said the damage was caused to the stairs and the building itself.
A crossbow may also be used to shoot at the car at any moment.
Menga's goal wins game 1-0 for Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston wins the game
Livingston, who had been promoted, was sacked by Rangers and Steven Gerrard lost for only the second time in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot made all the difference as Gary Holt's side were level on points with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side have gone winless away from home in the Premiership this season and next Sunday will play Hearts, who are ahead and eight points behind.
Prior to that game, Rangers will play Rapid Vienna at their home ground in the Europa League on Thursday.
While Livingston continues to go undefeated in the division in six games, with head coach Holt having not missed a game since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against clumsy visitors
Holt's team had long since moved on from winning before scoring a goal, with his direct style of play causing a lot of problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but he delivered the ball in front of the bat, then Alan Lithgow could only deliver the ball with a wide ball after he slipped to receive the ball from a header from Craig Halkett near the bat.
The home side were happy to let Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that it was the visitors who could give them trouble at certain times.
And that was how the crucial goal was achieved.
Rangers allowed a free-kick and Livingston took the opportunity, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to help Menga, who touched the ball and put it into the net from the centre of the box.
By this point, Rangers were dominating possession, but they were finding the team's defense playing on their own ground, impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble,
That style of play continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to catch the ball.
Scott Pittman failed to score as Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow shot the ball wide after dismissing another Livingston player.
Balls were always in Livingston's box and were always removed by their players, while two requests for a penalty - after Halkett's attempt on substitute Glenn Middleton, and another after the ball was touched by a player's hand - were rejected.
Phenomena from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland inside the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they were excellent, they continued to exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Their style of play and personnel have not changed much since their return to the main battle, but most credit should go to Holt for the way he has put the team together since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Head coach Halkett was very big in his games, putting together a hugely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in the lead.
However, Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they were playing very well at times under Gerrard, there was a lack of standards this time.
Their last chance with the ball was not good - they only managed to break the defence of the team playing on their own pitch once - and it is a signal for Rangers, who find themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan received mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) crowds gathered and sky was blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at mending relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then left for Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to block a large crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators - many of them Kurds - also raised their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome them into the country.
The protests against each other reflect the separation of a visitor who is a hero to some German Turks and thought to be an autocrat by others.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the south-east of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics attended, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred a few months after another cyclist died after being hit by a car while riding on Childers Street, about a mile away from the accident last Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Road closures and bus diversions are in place and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers are thrown into disorder
Six prison officials were arrested after a disturbance at a high-security men's prison, the Prison Office said.
The disorder started at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialised "Tornado" officers have been brought in to deal with the disturbance, involving eight prisoners and located in one of the sections.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A Prison Service spokesman said: 'Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to address an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and may spend more time in prison".
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison governor received treatment in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year riot officials were called to the prison to address a serious disturbance in which staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding (Dry Areas may benefit)
A tropical depression is rare to hit Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves out of the Western Desert, leading to risks of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already established a flash flood watch for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late on Monday in the rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service noted in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950"!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the AZ border".
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Arizona's Mohawk Rim.
Other areas of the Western Desert including the central Rockies and the Great Basin are likely to have an inch to 2 inches, with possible isolated totals up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of rapid flooding, the Rosa rainfall can be a positive thing as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious issue, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial as the west side is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to drought monitoring devices, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reports.
First, the route of Hurricane Rosa leads to the peninsula of Baja California de México.
Rosa, which will remain a very strong hurricane on Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and will move northward at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is meeting colder waters in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
It is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or early evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be heavy, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"A total of 3 to 6 inches of rain are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possibility of no more than 10 inches, weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then move through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rosa or its debris is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening flash floods and landslides in deserts, and avalanches in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested after attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured on Excelsior Terrace in the Midsomer Norton area, at around 0400 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he remains in a "stable" condition.
Seventeen-year-old teenagers, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area of Avon, Somerset Police said.
Officials appealed to anyone who might have a video from a mobile phone of what happened to speak.
Trump said Kavanaugh "sends the green and fury of the Democratic Party".
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and shocking tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "send the green and fury of the Democratic Party during his nomination process".
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying an allegation by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on its allegation.
On Saturday, the President said that, that day, the "American people saw the bravery and quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable public service record", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination while speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not contesting, but in fact, I am contesting", he said.
"That's why I'm running everywhere and fighting for very good candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership assistant told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, with death toll apparently rising
At least 384 people were killed, many washed away as huge waves washed down on beaches, after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when a six-metre (18-foot) wave came crashing down as darkness fell, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in between.
The tsunami followed a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not get up to run immediately and ended up with casualties", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster mitigation agency during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't just come out, it pulled cars, trees, houses, hit everything on the ground", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting shore.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
A powerful earthquake continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released from Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
They said the geography of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow beach, could have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of a collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people had been killed and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said that disasters and damage could be greater along the coast 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
Communications "were totally dispatched and without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the wave had arrived in time for the warning to be issued.
In a video of the amateur shared on social media, a man on the roof of a building can be heard anxiously shouting tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a huge amount of water came crashing onto the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused severe power outages that reduced communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities said the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport reopened only for relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll is well over 800.
It is a very serious situation.
While World Vision's staff from Donggala arrived strong and healthy in the city of Palu, where employees were hiding in armed tarpolin shelters in their office yard, they passed through a devastating scene on their way there, Mr Doseba said.
He said, "They told me they saw many houses destroyed.
It is a very serious situation.
As aid groups began the unpleasant process of disaster relief, a few complained about the fact that foreign aid workers with deep skills were not being allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad may only enter if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a provincial-level disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'O.K., this is a national disaster,' we can bring in international assistance but there's no status yet".
On the second night in Palo after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the still missing were still hopeful that their loved ones would be the miracles that brighten this natural disaster story.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a drain.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other detainees at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As a superior person in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight", he said.
Mr Gendon recounted how, in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated among the paragliding community, he sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, marked only that they had left, but not that they had arrived.
"I think that means the messages didn't arrive", he said.
They let them take $26,750 while the ATM was being refilled in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was cashing out an ATM at the amusement complex and was preparing to deliver more cash, Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the statement.
While busy with his work, another man "came running after the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he said: "The man formerly known as Kanye West
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while and used the moniker as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show which was cancelled for "emotional reasons", said the show's creator.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously stated that the word has religious significance to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, while discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Then I, you, I we, she, we.
From Kanye meaning "the one and only", to only Ye - simply a reflection of what we have good, bad, what confuses us, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are".
He is one of a number of famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
As a former collaborator of West, JAY-Z, also performs with or without singing and capitalizes.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he will "never use the military to restrain the Mexican people".
Troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square on 2 October 1968, killing about 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were being established throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by giving monthly subsidies to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
The United States should double the funding for IA.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in this area, says AI investor and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after several parts of the US government made AI notices, even though there is a lack of a formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research is a good start, as all other countries are far behind the US, and we are looking for the next revolutionary step in AI", said Lee.
Doubling up the funds could double the chances that the next major AI acquisition will take place in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that won the top-rated player of American Othello, and later was an executive with Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee recognized previous US government competitions in technology such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Lee said researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
Lee said, "It's not China that's removing academic leaders; corporations are doing it.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university inspirers to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen its AI efforts.
He said, "I believe that the green card should be offered automatically to people with a PhD in AI".
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
Lee said that the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funds to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations issue money to US researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of an Artificial Intelligence Select Committee.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, US legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence saw no action for several months.
The people of Macedonia vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a step to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked its offers of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbourhood in its north represents a possibility of possession of its territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether turnout would reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum vote reads: 'You are in favour of membership of NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece.'
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a reasonable consequence for Macedonia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us, said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there was no report of irregularities as of 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only  16 percent, compared to  34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change giving it the opportunity to join NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was throwing a small pole and preparing chairs in front of tents armed with those who will boycott the referendum.
"We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to enter proudly on our own terms, not by commanding others", said Kavadarkov.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not accept us as Macedonia, we can play for others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asian integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe the vast majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a result in favour of the name change would be "a confirmation of our future".
A poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum - an amount below the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, turnout must be 50 per cent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it will represent the first serious blow to the government's pro-Western ideology policy since it took control in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, passes through all of Brighton's defence for the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look very easy.
The striker from Argentina received a ball from midfield at the start of the sequence.
He went through three Brighton defenders before running into the open.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four players with green blocks.
He fought one defender before escaping much further to the edge of Brighton's box.
Then he distributed the ball on his left and found Sterling.
The English striker first touched the ball in the box to re-deploy Aguero, who used his right foot to push the ball into the right side of the net by evading Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
"Aguero is sending me some foot problems", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about the fact that he was going to play 55, 60 minutes.
That is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep into Brighton's territory in that action.
He passed the ball right to Leroy Sane on the left side very nicely.
Sane touched the ball just before he led Sterling to the basket.
The Sky Blues striker touched the ball and put it in the net just before it slid into the territory he was not supposed to enter.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in a spoiler vs. Rockies
As Nationals were eliminated from the possibility of competing in the deciding game, there was no reason to make an effort to restart.
But highly competitive player Scherzer hopes to be the starting pitcher on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications that the Rockies have a chance to play in the deciding game, which is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies managed to get a chance to compete again with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win their first division title.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can have a chance to win knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is crowded and the other team is probably playing at the highest level of any point I can face this year.
What would you like to compete under those circumstances?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start Sunday, but are allegedly inclined to let Scherzer be the pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, had a practice session on Thursday and will be pitching on Sunday when he is usually resting.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation concerning his selection for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"In November, everything we have done will be threatened.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is a very big -- I'm not contesting, but in fact, I'm contesting so I'm running everywhere fighting for very good candidates, he said.
"We're seeing this very horrible and radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happening right now", Trump continued.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you can see the green.
They don't care who they hurt, who they want to fly to get power and control, what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them".
He said the Democrats have a mission to "resist and obstruct".
"And I've seen this over the last four days", he said, and he was calling the Democrats "angry and green and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred to ranking Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein on the Senate Judiciary Committee on her behalf, and received a lot of negative outcry from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Have you got the Document?
Uh, uh, what is it?
No, uh no, wait, first of all- her body movements were not positive at all- the worst movements I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a broad group.
Does not tolerate anyone who shares his views
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I didn't take it seriously.
After all, I am the most recent Labour MP to be dismissed - because we have shared our views.
My colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she fought against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censure motion criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday stated that "I want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Council meetings on Friday evenings were exactly like this.
Unfortunately today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a more compassionate and kind policy that has long been forgotten if, in fact, it ever really began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each opinion is judged on its acceptability to the leadership of the party.
This started shortly after Jeremy took over, as colleagues with whom I thought I had a similar political view began to expect me to change my mind and take positions I had never agreed with in other situations - whether on national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak publicly - and, frankly, it makes no difference what I say - they come after me on social media with a demand to remove me from my post as an MP, denounce the politics of the centre, and tell me that I am not a member of the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
Yes, I know I've had better luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face many sexual or racist abuse every day but never hide from the comments.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the fact that abuse levels have become normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad group and with every motion of no confidence or change in the selection rules, the game becomes narrow.
I have been given a lot of advice over the past two years that encouraged me to keep my opinions to myself, not be so vocal and then everything will be fine".
But I did not enter politics to do so.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's negligence that left my comprehensive school classroom in a literal disaster, I have sought to improve public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I never hid my politics, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been, in any way, confused about my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I can say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public services, I cannot understand the desire to devote my time and energy to loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in truth, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether Labour Party members or not: I am proud to work for you and I assure you that no amount of threats to remove me from office or political expediency will discourage me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr, who have not lost once, rise to the top of the standings
Two attempts could have changed the outcome slightly, but there was no doubt that Ayr had earned the win in this exciting day's game of the Tennent's Premiership.
They are currently first in the standings, the only team out of all ten not to have lost once.
In the end, it was their superior defence, as well as their ability to seize opportunities, that helped the team, which was playing on its own ground, win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We have been through trials in our games so far, and we haven't lost one, so I'm happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Give Ayr credit, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did".
With Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try converted by Frazier Climo, Ayr were winning, however, a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was given the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to try and Jason Baggot made an unconverted try.
Climo extended Ayr's win with a penalty, before, just halfway through the game, he scored a goal and converted an individual try to make the points 17-5 for Ayr at half-time.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's attempt, converted by Baggot, narrowed the gap by 5 points.
The game was then stopped due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who came off the pitch on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued to take points after a try from Stafford McDowall, converted by Climo.
Then, Ayr's chief agent Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and once again, Melrose came out aggressively when he made an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, after a period of heavy pressure.
However, the home team attacked again, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for his no-ball action on Climo, from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ball to the ground on the back of Ayr's advancing group.
Climo converted, as he had done once again almost from the starting zone, after Kyle Rowe picked up the ball that met David Armstrong from inside the box and sent Gregor Henry, who played on the wing, for the fifth try of the side playing on its own pitch.
The still game personality seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game personality Ford Kieran appears to be ready to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was named as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old who plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next series will be the last of the programme, and it appears that Kiernan is planning for his life after Craiglang.
According to the lists in the official registers, he is the director of  Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was seeking to get involved in Glasgow's very successful restaurant business.
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, surrounded by land, hopes the court will reopen passage to the Pacific
Seafarers stand guard at the naval headquarters armed with ropes and chains in La Paz.
A public building shall have an ocean blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: "The sea is rightfully ours.
To recover it is a duty".
Across Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of Chile's lost coastline in a bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still vivid - as is the desire for Bolivians to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope is perhaps at its highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the international court of justice on 1 October after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and serenity, and of course is looking forward to the outcome with a positive mindset", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICTY decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will find, in favour of Bolivia's claim, that - after decades of irregular talks - Chile is obliged to negotiate and give Bolivia a sovereign sea port.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year - also has much to lose in Monday's decision.
"We are very close to having access to the Pacific Ocean again", he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and that little will change if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory, and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ECtHR's ruling comes only six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favouring the Bolivian cause, the last four years may not have been helpful.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken up by the current Bolivian administration", said Zárate.
Morales' hostile rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean start, it suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will, at some point, continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision-making was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as political aid.
'Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
"The sentence is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its first nuclear weapon if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri had spoken on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the US to deliver on promises made during a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the rivals.
He makes his comments as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on his way to restarting nuclear diplomacy that has been stalled for more than three months after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a vain hope" that continued sanctions and the US's objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever make North Korea surrender.
Washington is concerned about whether to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first significant steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons that the country likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest collection of massive headwear to hit the stores.
If you want to add to your collection of shoes or cover the sun completely, you can stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of bizarre and oversized headwear for their Spring/Summer 2019 collection on the runway that crowned the fashion set at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical shoes are very popular on Instagram this summer and these designers have taken their amazing creations to the stage.
Valentino's most striking item was an extravagant beige hat decorated with a wide, rust-like edge that completely covered the models' heads.
Other very large accessories included jewel-covered wristbands, a magic hat and even pineapples - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation resembled a diving apparatus complete with a snorkel and goggles, while another resembled a melted ice cream cone.
And if you continue in this way - good luck.
Fashion watchers predict that huge bonnets will soon appear in the mainstream stores.
The huge shoes come after the release of  La Bomba, the two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label responsible for the impractical hat that was widely seen on social media has raised another big creation on stage - a straw basket that is almost the size of the model wearing a shirt they were carrying.
The dark orange raffle basket, surrounded by thin raffle sprigs and a white leather grip, was the highlight of Jacquemus's 2019 Spring and Summer collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see big caps and sea baskets in the flagship stores next summer - since the designer has made such an impact, it will be very difficult to ignore the demand for very large accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of excellent exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and for their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a personalised school curriculum, we are seeing modern languages remain a popular and desirable choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If a man speaks in a language he understands, he understands with his mind.
If you speak in his own language, he understands with his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year's recent examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the ranking tables with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of  68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages achieved an A-Level.
Data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools, showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A-Level in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students also achieved A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now, as a subject choice, being held in the same regard as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that of the reasons given by employers for sending people to fill vacancies, 17 per cent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly imperative to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more prospective job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career you choose, learning another language will have a real advantage in the future as it has the potential to last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 per cent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation and, at 15 per cent, French is the only language spoken in double figures.
This is why investing in language learning is now important for today's children.
Knowing more than one language, particularly in developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, each school will learn different languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are seen as most important for the UK looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
It cannot be denied that languages remain very important for the future of the country, and this should be reflected in education, in a global business environment.
Indeed, modern languages should truly be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
The faut bien le faire.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
On Sunday, LeBron will play his first game against the Lakers in San Diego.
Sports fans of LeBron James didn't wait long to see him start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the opening preseason game on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes to be played has yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that, likely, James will play a limited amount of minutes.
After the practice session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule before the Lakers start of the season.
"At this stage in my career I don't need pre-season games to prepare myself", he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump's five demonstrations scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote suspended for his selection to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how do you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via a live YouTube stream.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have become intense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an early Senate confirmation vote suspended for a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary purpose of this wave of demonstrations is to help Republicans face the November elections to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump's campaign said that these five demonstrations next week are aimed at "empowering volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
Congressional control is so important to this agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach the challenging campaign season, a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to be named told Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's rally could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is losing the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to push him into the poll", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA determined not to give up as they head into Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could have been just what she needed for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a completely invented sporting concept but one that players truly believe in, and never more so than in competitions like this.
So where do they say the momentum is now?
"They were six points ahead and now they are four, so I think we are taking this as a bit of momentum", said Jordan Spieth as he left during the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with 12 more to play.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel they have a few flaws and have a lot to encourage them, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each boast three points from four.
Spieth was accurate from tee to green and leading by example.
That heartfelt shout of celebration grew as he continued his round, making a crucial putt to bring the fourth game even when he and Thomas were two down after two.
His 15-point game-winning putt was met with a similar roar, the kind that tells you he believes the American team is still there.
You really have to go deep and worry about your own game, said Spieth.
That's what each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed Ryder Cup champions.
The strange but cute couple from Europe are four in four and considered perfect.
Moliwood were the only pair not to bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeyes on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and nine o'clock on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this lively crowd establishes that they are the players who are offering a challenge on Sunday, and there is no more popular player to seal a potential European win as the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both on different holes.
But we are talking here about a European glory for which it is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were quickly finished off by Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and two doubles on the front nine drove the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they never got close to exiting.
But on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are very fascinating to watch up close because of the peer interactions, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and the way strategy can change in a second.
Europe played better as a team so they came in late and took the lead on the final day but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the determination that some, especially the US side, were doubting.
Europe leads by 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes games ahead of the United States by 10-6 points.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made the effort with two wins over Tiger Woods who found it difficult to take their score so far ahead at Le Golf National by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, ready to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American side that went wrong in the morning's fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resilience in the foursomes, winning two games, but could not come to the score difference.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points from Sunday's 12-game one-man playoff to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first new European for the season to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed Molliwood after a sensational weekend are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After dominating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs they then worked excellently to beat the not-so-optimistic Woods and new American player of the season Bryson Dechambeau by an even more empathetic score of 5&4.
Woods, who struggled in both matches on Saturday, showed occasional moments of brilliance but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, a morning fourball star, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are ranked first and third in the world.
But not everything went as Europe had hoped on a beautiful day, with a few weddings in the south of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time major winner, and Justin Thomas set the limit for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They secured a brave 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the opening two holes.
It was only twice in Ryder Cup history that a team came back from a four-point gap entering the singles, although Furyk's side holders needed a draw to retain the trophy.
However, having been second best for two days, Sunday's counterattack looks like it will be more than they can do.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without a vote of confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening its distrust of the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "considerable goodwill measures" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pledging non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we do not see a corresponding response from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will by no means disarm ourselves unilaterally first.
While Ri repeated familiar complaints from North Korea about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearisation in which North Korea was rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement made it significant that he did not reject a thoughtless unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between an acting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea had been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation first and increases the level of pressure through  sanctions to achieve their aim in a coercive manner, and even objects to  the declaration of the end of the war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can break us is the dream of people who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our lack of confidence.
Ri did not mention plans for the second Kim-Trump summit that the US leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: If the party to this denuclearisation issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President Trump called Kim a rocket man on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courageous steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timeline for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't make a difference".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday told the UN Security Council that: Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without pause until we achieve fully and finally verified denuclearisation.
The Security Council unanimously strengthened sanctions on North Korea from 2006 with a view to halting funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, after being criticised by North Korea within hours for making "gangster-like" demands.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to disarm a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States takes corresponding measures.
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has succeeded in getting all its undergraduates to sleep more in an effort to combat the growing macho culture of studying all night and staying awake on caffeine.
An academic found that university students in the top spot in the world often have no idea about the really basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally a girl came to me and said, "Why are you telling me this now, when I'm one year old?"
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which started for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleep traditions help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall wellbeing.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of university health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students had severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a student bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, trays, trainers and books to be taught about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a sleep-time routine.
In another section, participants are told how prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risks of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
Then, a campus map, interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know that it will not change students' behaviour immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of being proud to stay up all night studying still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that students get enough, and good quality, sleep should be a student's secret weapon to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - including to prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, which makes them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California, studying chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to insist on a course around campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to do a similar study programme before joining the competing institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when they go to sleep, as well as when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which can balance your circadian rhythm, leading to problems sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeats Gerrard's men
Rangers suffered another period of disappointment playing away as Dolly Menga's strike delivered Steven Gerrard's split side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to record their first ever victory as they travelled from February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Hold's side only caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager to leave his side eight points behind the big leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership, Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and the Rangers' roster of players lacking inspiration never seemed to catch up.
While Rangers now drop to sixth place, Livingston rise to third and only behind Hibernian on a goal difference.
And there may be more trouble for Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after apparently being handed an item by fans of the team playing abroad.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in Ayr's run to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and was content with the way his well-trained form constantly hampered their opponents.
Rangers could have dominated possession but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They had scored just two minutes from the start when Menga's first-half lay-off sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal but the midfielder took his big chance.
Keaghan Jacobs' strong free-kick then found skipper Craig Halkett but his defender partner Alan Lithgow could only kick from behind.
Rangers gained control but there seemed to be more hope than belief about their game in the third final.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have had a penalty on the fifteenth minute mark as he and Steven Lawless fought but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Combians' appeals.
Rangers managed to score just two goals in the first half of the match but previous Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely bothered by Lassana Coulibaly's head kick and Ovie Ejaria's light strike.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute could have been when the other team was playing better, no one can deny that it was only deserved for their efforts.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage Jacobs' good set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm to pick Menga to end the action.
Gerrard reacted at the brake by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the change almost provided an immediate impact as the winger drove into Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block.
But Livingston continued to draw the visitors to play exactly the kind of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett catching long ball after long ball.
Holt's side were able to extend their lead in the final stages but McGregor held on well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow went into the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late request for a penalty as he argued with Jacobs but once again Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, as 136 years today, and we are going to remember... the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to identify and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the  Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science ever since, the Geiger counter has become a cornerstone of pop culture as well, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", which features those unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "Are you from the slums?"
Rogers: That's a  Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these hoods, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that give radioactivity to minerals.
Evans: You say, she's definitely popular now!
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention in his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see abnormal behaviour in cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to see abnormal behaviour and kill it
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize abnormal behaviour cells as part of treatment
The method involves extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are grown in a laboratory
They can then see a protein common to many cancers and then inject it back into the patient.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize abnormally behaving cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory to detect a protein common to many cancers called HER2, then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of  several types of  cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and teaching them to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West made a verbal attack in favor of Trump, while wearing a MAGA Beretta, after his appearance on SNL.
This Did Not Go Well
Kanye West was booed in the studio on Saturday Night Live after a confusing performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for re-election in 2020.
After singing his third song of the night, Ghost Town in which he wore a Make America Great beret, he began speaking out against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I've often talked to a white person and they say, "How can you please Trump, that racist?"
If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America", he said.
SNL began the program with a sketch of the comedy starring Matt Damon in which Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee about sexual assault claims made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to get West to come over when he posted it.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that they had caught up with him after the story about his barber.
Boil me after the quatrains.
"Get out of the city, " they said".
They boil me!
Then they say it's lost", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: "You want to see the lost?" and he went on to say that he was going to wear my Superman hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.
His comments sparked at least two roars from the audience and members of the SNL cast seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio fell silent".
West brought him on as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with his performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the president of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who wrote on Twitter: To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR STANDING FOR THE FOLK.
But host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West was simply who he was and that's a beautiful thing.
But I have NOT chosen to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is free.
So much else we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now what was previously known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The previous rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the now-defunct music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder on a knife attack in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington speaks out about toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, spoke out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such on-screen roles mean that the youngster often feels they need to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to  The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and had doubts about how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones cousin Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he has a strong interest in addressing the issue.
Personally, I feel I have a strong interest, at the moment - where did we go wrong with masculinity?, he said.
What are we teaching men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we have now?
Kit believes television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity through its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is natural and what is taught?
What is it that is taught on TV, and on the streets, that makes young people feel that they want to be this certain side of a man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
Because it's very clear that something has gone wrong for the young man.
In the interview he also admitted that he will not be making prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that "there are wars and horses".
From November Kit will appear in Sam Shepard's new production of True West which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a wizard.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on this programme, so that way I got my future family, and my life from here on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reported a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmission of diseases come from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a staff member disclosed GOP senator data, says "dangerous lies" and "confusing theories"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat asserted that the claims were being spread by pundits and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more lies by the so-called ones", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released allegedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information of a member of Waters' staff, the Hill reported.
This baseless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie, Waters continued.
My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the disclosure of this information.
This baseless allegation is completely false and a complete lie.
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This refusal is one of anger", wrote Fleischer.
It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
It must not be resistant.
He shall not doubt the prosecutor's motives.
It should be calm and serene.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also mentioned his voice on Twitter.
"This is a great thing if it is true", he said on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities about these fraudulent claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, he continued, and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions which are harmful and dangerous to each and every member of my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson, a weak spy imitation
It has now become traditional to look for Brexit meanings in any new film from a British perspective and this seems applicable to the return of the Johnny English action-comedy franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came to life again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
The ironic self-satire on the subject of how obviously bad we are, is the opportunity for a new export of the country?
At any rate, the incompetent Johnny English with his big eyes and unusually moving facial parts had his license renewed for a second time to do everything wrong - that name more than anything else shows that he is a widespread comic creature designed for the territories of non-English-speaking cinema goers.
Of course it is the stupid secret agent who despite his strange pretensions to his sweet charm has a little bit of Clouseau, a bit of Mr Bean and a lot of that man who contributed one note to the theme tune of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
It is also originally based on the traveller and international mystery man who Atkinson once did his part in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, having left chaos behind.
There's a good moment or two in this last issue of JE.
I loved the moment when Johnny English was approaching a helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the edge of the shield was held to his helmet for a moment.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is apparent, but the humor feels rather poor and oddly redundant, especially since film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt as if it was aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's strange unfortunate accidents were not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's wordless film joke in the person of Bean.
The perennial topical proposition now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated the highly secret web network of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, much to the disappointment of the agent on duty - unfortunately a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the icing on the cake for the imperialistic and troubled prime minister, already suffering a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her best in this Teresa May-like character but there is not much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that any active spy has been compromised, she'll have to bring someone back.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, now employed as a teacher in a fancy building, but giving unofficial lessons on how to become an undercover operative: a good joke here as English offers a School of Rock-style spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for emergency meetings and joins his former partner of great patience, Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, with a submarine commander, a role of a single woman played by Vicki Pepperdine, in which she is somewhat of a drifter.
Thus the inseparable pair who always mess everything up in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action, when they meet the character of the seductive and beautiful woman Ophelia Bulletova played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the thumb of a sweet tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farcical fun-loving behavior: dressing up as waiters, setting fire to a high-rise French restaurant, creating chaos to board Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins total anarchy as he tries to use VR headsets to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's home.
Certainly all the breaks lead to that last sequence, but friendly and animated as he is, he has a little idea of children's television.
Something rather moderate.
And like the other Johnny English films I couldn't help but think: can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really deserves his talent?
Labour denies it is preparing a plan for Britons to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that would see Britons work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
Allegedly the party wants the corporate bosses to pass on the leftovers from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them another day off.
This would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend - but still take the same pay with them.
Sources said the idea would be at odds with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in favour of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: Expect a policy review to be announced before the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight but a  four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the worker as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, with the Green Party promising a four-day workweek during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration is currently not being endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day workweek is not a party policy and the party is not considering it".
Opposition Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "anonymous directors" and "beneficiaries" of utility trusts.
The opposition chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not take back their entire stake as soon as a Labour government can make cuts based on perceived misconduct.
It also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create Ownership Funds to give 10 per cent of private sector firms' equity to employees, who are willing to take annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed a final vote on his Supreme Court nomination by a week, raising the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Right, and sure", said Kennedy.
I said I went into the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after that allegation came out, I said, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.
Graham's vote, however, seems difficult to change.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it must be a very big charge", he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know a thing, but I know this: Brett rejected it strongly", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And every person who mentions it cannot verify this.
She is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new change.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and Did Something to Reduce Poverty?
Next Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive list of stars to appear and another equally impressive mission; to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a representative group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or actions such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or some other meaningful way to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - people feeling they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million actions by its supporters, supporting a number of different causes.
It says these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are equivalent to more than $37 billion that are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 commitments and announcements from its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that secure funds have so far directly impacted almost 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of  investors and implementers committed to helping children grow to their full potential,  pledging to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history, The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to invite the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
Answer to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website asking what makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?
Global Citizen replied: It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed, because we are more powerful when we are together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists to appear at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US uses the Naval Fleet to block to hamper Russian energy exports - Home Office
If necessary, Washington could use its Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including the Middle East, US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke alleged that Russia's expansion in Syria - especially, where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe, he allegedly said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means of addressing this.
The US has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open, and, if necessary, to blockade, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to addressing Russia and Iran, noting that they are effectively the same.
The economic choice over Iran and Russia is, more or less, fuel gear and substitution, he said, referring to Russia as someone with a single currency with an economy that depends on carbureted fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to pressure Germany to pull out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump, has made Berlin the "silence" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers, said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position attracted an adverse reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from Europe's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will be tested whether to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she will "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a board meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering leaving.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman in the highest office", she said, according to The Hill.
After 6 November, I will consider carefully whether to run for president.
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the council meeting, saying he was taking this country in the wrong direction.
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Waren's own constituents do not think she should run for election in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts "probable" voters said the senator should not run for office, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent supported the exit for the election.
The poll showed more support for exit for election than previous Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential exit for election and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names that have been discussed in regards to potential exit for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin refers to Track Palin's PTSD at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being registered in September
He was arrested and brought in on a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"What my son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, I can relate to other families who feel the ramifications of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers come back with", she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the obvious problem that nobody is addressing" and said of her son and other war veterans, "They come back a little different, come back stronger, come back wondering if there is that respect for what other soldiers like them and air personnel, and every other member of the military, have given to the country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence assault on a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new US policy denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District on Friday filed a friend of the court case in Washington to support a policy-defying asylum seeker, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said that her partner and the children of gang members abused her but that US officials denied her asylum request on 20 July.
She was held in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States, as the nations face pervasive problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
On Friday, in a statement, District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said the new policy ignores decades of state, federal and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum claims be adjudicated on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ground violates this principle, said a friend of the court case.
Lawyers went on to argue that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the US economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion, Sessions said in his policy announcement on 11 June.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts desperate in Palu as death toll doubles in race against time to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly dire.
"It feels very intense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she held her feverish baby son in an evacuation centre in the hapless city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents seemed to return to their destroyed homes, searching through their flooded belongings, trying to salvage everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, devastated by the 7.5-magnitude quake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his liver and shoulder, remained outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are being treated outside due to continuous severe shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related how he felt the violent quake move the floor of the hotel on the fifth floor that he was using with his wife and daughter.
There was no chance to save ourselves.
I was crushed by the debris, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in the area for a wedding.
I heard my wife cry for help, then silence.
I don't know a thing about her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page ad in a US daily trying to sell the reciprocal benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has seen them pass rounds of tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and the longtime former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now duplicating this bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free expression and free press by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register, wrote Branstad.
In contrast, on the newspaper stand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited circulation voices and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China's troubled economic trajectory, as the media is under the constraint of the Chinese Communist Party, he wrote.
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers had avoided the offer to publish his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans are alienating women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh debate, analysts warn
As many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh while he faces multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts have warned that he will see an adverse reaction, particularly during the next midterm elections.
Emotions about this were very high, and most Republicans are already officially showing they want to lead with the vote.
These things cannot be undone, Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Ariz.) last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
Women will not forget a tree yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate chamber as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to run with Kavanaugh's nomination despite a statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be at a very high level, said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst at the news site.
People are saying they were already high; and they are.
But they can be higher, particularly among women voters who cast ballots in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, while disliking the president, often do not vote.
Even before Ford's public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested an adverse reaction could follow if Republicans lead with the confirmation.
"This has become a complete disaster for the GOP", said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not just about the committee vote or the final vote on whether to put Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans handled this situation and how they handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news station.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who believes in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's statements, with little support for the latter.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's statement, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Ford's statement.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's ouster, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunk and attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals to her while they were at a party when they were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is going to launch a new business that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company building on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people they have permission to access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee made it clear that the intent behind Inrupt is world domination.
We must do it now", he said of the new business.
This is a historic moment.
The application uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal data online store or POD.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
This is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and all at the same time.
What makes the online personal data store unique is that it is completely up to the user to access any type of information.
The company calls this personal autonomy through data.
The idea for Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is that the company brings resources, process skills and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform brought in by IBM, some contracted staff developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We do not ask their permission.
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new site built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even while launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am a huge optimist for this next era of the web, added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebrated cleric of the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was commemorated in his village 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel the Reverend Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won Britain's highest military honour.
On Saturday a memorial stone by his two nephews was unveiled in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was to be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize win.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Kur led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a lot of smoke and fire from on-site shells and machine guns".
Later he rushed to the line of fire and bravely led the line forward before he shot himself on the spot and knocked out three of the crew.
Lieutenant Kur was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never get to but something very humiliating".
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a garland behind the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honoured to have played a role in this parade" and added that the courage of a true hero was being shown by the support that will be given by many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead of ending up with Peppa Pig
Imagine that, having stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 packed up to end up missing the main event.
The listing from San Jose included 13 fights, including six on the main card and was being shown live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying up late especially for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the change to a children's cartoon as a kind of a "blank joke".
It is government regulation that at 6am that content was inappropriate so they had to switch to children's programmes, said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communication at  Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
Pig pepper, yes.
Belator company president Scott Coker said they will work on their schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
I think that when I think about rehearsal, we can probably work something out, said Coker.
But right now it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning and we won't be able to make it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned on there were a lot of messages going on and not all of them were sweet.
We were trying to fix the solution, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that next time it won't happen.
We're going to limit it to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to get more to the fans and instead we went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until secondary school that not everyone was like him.
Speaking on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give hope to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he became less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the ongoing program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of illness.
While appearing as an outcast on Laverne's first programme, Daley said he felt less than others growing up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said: "To this day, those emotions that you feel less than, and feel different, have been the real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "something", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when his sexuality eventually became known.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile promoter for LGBT and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without ramifications and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man - US film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - it was a surprise to him.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year but said the age difference was never an issue.
After going through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find anyone his age who had experienced similar beautiful and harsh experiences.
The couple became parents in June, to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you ask me last year, the important thing for me was that I wanted to win a gold medal", he said.
You know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 aged 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the things he asked was if they already had tickets to London 2012 - as he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you'd be here to be in the front row", he said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally recognized he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dance in front of a crowd of countries at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", he said.
It also inspired his first song choice - Heather Small's Proud - which was compatible with him on the run to the Olympics and still catches the cold.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who is out of shape, remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to avoid a less-than-exciting major stage.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event a record 12 times, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Rather than being the centre of the action, as he was often for the United States, the five-time grand champion divided his day between enduring and working on his game from a distance in the hope of rectifying his anxiety.
Never a right-hander even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not ideal for the difficult course of Le Golf National, where long-distance shots are often punished by misses.
And if the course alone isn't heartbreaking enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, faces defending British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points off the start of the 12-game single, start well, Mickelson's game could prove to be a very crucial point.
Furyk expressed confidence in his husband, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back and put his arms around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I saw more, but that's the way it worked and that's the way we thought it would go.
He wants to be out there, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has barely reached the milestones of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought few intangibles to the team.
He's introverted, sarcastic, humorous, likes to make fun of people, and a very nice guy to have in the team room, he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed criticizing him, this week, which was a fun thing to watch.
It provides much more than just games.
European captain Thomas Bjorn that the big front position could disappear quickly
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a badly-shod front position before the final day's singles in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side led by Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans but finished with a narrow margin of victory, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but by a narrow margin", Bjorn said, in the press, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to be 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that it's not over yet.
Tomorrow you will go with your soul and your body.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It's not over until you've got the points on the team.
We have a goal, and what we're trying to do is to win this trophy, and the focus will stay there.
I always said, focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well what's on the other side - the greatest players in the world.
Happy with how his players played on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I never go too far in this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow is about the individual performances we see, and that's something different to do.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out individually, you're then tested for your full ability as a golfer.
That's the message you want to pass on to the players, that you come out your best tomorrow.
Now, leave your partner behind and he wants to leave and bring out his best, too.
In contrast to Bjorn, opposing number Jim Furyk will be looking to get his players to play better individually than when they did as partners, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have gained three points from four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of those last days that could change everything, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending up losing as Europe performed the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember at least one word of it", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, prepared his players for the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get to that start quickly as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum reaches one side, it puts a lot of pressure on those middle parts.
We made our list properly and put those guys in a way that we felt, you know, we were trying to do some miracles tomorrow.
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the fight back and face Roy McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I went with this group of men in this way because I think it covers the whole road", said Bjorn about his singles choices.
Germany's new war postponed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was due to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era frigates in service, but will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new flamboyant Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problematic issues after delivery have hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy back in 2007 will replace the Bremen-class frigates in service.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, an anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile display as well as some cautious technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to operate the newest frigates up to two years away from home ports.
However, continuous delays mean that the state-of-the-art vessels - which allow Germany to project power offshore - will already be obsolete by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for this, but the German media cited a number of crucial software and hardware flaws that made the ship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel will be operated by a crew of approximately 120 seamen - only half the workforce on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the vessel appeared to have a significant overweight which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The  7,000-ton  Rheinland-Pfalz is understood to be twice as heavy as similar class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including crew training - is also becoming an issue.
This is said to have reached a staggering €3.1bn ($3.6bn) - up from the initial €2.2bn.
The problems of the newly exposed fleet become especially important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy currently lacks deployable ships.
The official said that the problem had grown over time, as old vessels were being commissioned but no replacement vessels were being provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust mentions the secret life of moths at night
New ground research in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how night herons use the landscape to forage.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats as well as brown long-eared night herons and Daubenton in the Inverewe Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track night butterfly activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out a mobile survey using handheld detectors.
Expert analysis of the sounds of all recordings will ascertain the frequency of night calls of the moths and which species are doing what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a nature conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for night herons and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of pastures and how best to maintain forest for night herons and other associated species.
The population of moths in Scotland and across the UK has declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting their homes and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can poisoned paper to catch insects and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Night sparrows are not actually blind.
However, because of their night hunting traditions their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to identify insects and obstacles in their path when flying.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes night owls very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out surveys, home inspections and sometimes rescue.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only night butterfly reserve on Threave land in Dumfries and Galloway, which hosts eight of Scotland's ten species of night butterflies.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
Here in Threave we have a very good area for night owls, he said.
We have the old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
But there is much more about night butterflies that is still unknown, so the work we do here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to flourish.
It stresses the importance of night owls being checked for maintenance on property as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single maternity home could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly wiping out an entire local population.
Night owls are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them or destroy their homes.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official for the Night Butterfly Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: 'We still have a lot to learn about our night butterflies and for many of our species we still don't know where their populations are going. '
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to search German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has pointed out rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people want to promote themselves using his name.
His lawyers are expected to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 that day to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking on video on Instagram Live to his 142 million followers hours after the claims were reported, Ronaldo, 33, referred to the reports as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no, no. This is not a game.
What they said today, fake news, said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner looking into the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
It is normal.
They have to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is going to be fine", the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they call "unacceptable reporting of privacy suspects", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player was seeking compensation for moral damages in an amount corresponding to the gravity of the breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her from the anus, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was a 99% "good man" disappointed with the 1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "overwhelmed by retaliation" and was worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking to reverse the solution as she is still traumatised by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo had arrived to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer he moved to Italian football legends Juventus in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'forever sorry' for losing carmakers
The UK would "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Trade Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "concerned" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement", said Mr Clark.
The Japanese manufacturer claimed that the impact of a delay at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit costs jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced almost 150,000 cars last year of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see a production shutdown at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its  Mini plant for a month after Brexit.
The main concern relates to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line today operates on a   just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be obstacles at the border which the industry says could lead to delays and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these border controls.
"We need an agreement.We want to have the best deal that allows, as I say, not only the success to be enjoyed in the present but to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Evidence not only from Toyota but from other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what was a hugely successful set of  supply chains.
Toyota could not say for how long production would be halted, but in a longer period, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union convener for Unite at the plant, said his members were becoming increasingly worried: In my experience when these jobs leave, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump's risky meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be delayed another week as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's aid to Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has incited anger in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, despite reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, she announced a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "prefers not to fire" Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a disagreement with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that included Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both of whom gave their testimony.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh over a week, which took longer than a full Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News.
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "No date has been set for this yet, it could be this week, and it could be next week due to all the other things going on with the supreme court.
But now we see and I always like to keep the picture updated.
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the scarcity of meetings was not due to a lack of grace with TV journalists  trying to attract and influence audiences, although she said:  Although I agree with the fact that they are trying to attract and influence audiences.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president holds more Q&A sessions than any previous president, she added without citing any evidence: We looked at those numbers.
Meetings will still continue, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask questions of the president of the United States directly, that is far better than talking to me.
We try to do this a lot and we've seen it done a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace the press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump rarely answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open sessions or press conferences when visiting dignitaries.
Individual press conferences are rare.
This week in New York the president probably showed why he behaves so relaxed and sometimes awkwardly in front of groups of journalists.
Health secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wish that they remain there after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter when less than six months remained before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the cost of applications for defined status for EU citizens working in its devolved public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal continued, leading to decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK Government was also stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is certainly an unstable time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to say now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills to strengthen and improve the workings of the health service, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and I really wish you could stay here.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after sustaining an injury on Saturday when his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He went over the sideline and kind of fell there", Reed said.
The trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him to the back for further examination.
An official from the State of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was no longer being operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are currently no details on the type/ extent of the injury" and the State of Tennessee is trying to understand when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a suspended sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
On Saturday he had five total tackles before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged more stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be asked to pay more stamp duty when they buy property in the UK with the surplus money being used to help the homeless under new Tory plans
This change will offset the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on taxpayers in the UK
The Treasury expects this to rise to £120 million a year - to help homeless people
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher rate of stamp duty when buying property in the UK - with the surplus money being used to help the homeless.
The change will be seen as an attempt to offset the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The increase in the toll tax will be imposed on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the surplus money boosting the Government's efforts to fight street sleep.
The additional charge - which is additional to the current toll tax, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and purchase for rental purposes - could be three per cent.
The Treasury expects this change to rise to £120 million a year.
Around 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which is driving up prices and making it more difficult for new buyers to make the first step in the housing buying phases.
Many wealthy areas of the country - particularly in the capital city - have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time abroad.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction firms of keeping property prices high by plundering land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing to fix the 'housing shame situation' in the UK.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of eye-catching housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" layoffs.
It also wants to give councils great powers to build new homes.
Ms May said: Last year I said I would dedicate my office to reviving the UK's dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
The UK will always remain open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, find it as easy to buy houses as the elite residents of the UK.
For many people the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the indignity of sleeping on the streets remains very real.
Jack Ross: My fundamental ambition is to manage Scotland
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his fundamental ambition is to one day become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot is taking up the challenge of rebuilding the Greek club, currently in third place in League One, three points clear of first place.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for countries as a player.
I got a B cap and nothing more", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But when I was a kid I often went with my father to see Scotland play at Hampden, and that's always been the thing that drew me back.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed in managing a club.
Those who came before Ross as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about following such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At the moment, my success will be based on can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
"The club's structure and facilities make it clear that it belongs in the Premier League", he said.
It is not easy to get there, but I probably only consider myself successful here if I manage to take the club back there.
Ross has only been in his managerial career for three years, following a period as assistant head coach at Dumbarton and after spending 15 months with the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and transformed St Mirren from relegation-bound to Championship title winners the following season.
And Ross says he's now feeling more comfortable than he did during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
As regards the time when he took Alloa into his care, he recalled that this was probably a big change.
I really thought the manager's job was the best fit for me, much more than a player's.
This may sound strange, since I was doing well, living a decent life, and enjoying some reasonable advantages.
But games can be difficult.
There are many things you have to go through each week.
I still experience this in terms of stress and work pressure but I simply feel that the manager's job is right for me.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, and I feel like in my entire adult life I'm now feeling more comfortable.

A survey finds that the best time to drink a pint of beer is at 5.30pm
The summer heat wave boosted the profits of the struggling UK pubs but put further pressure on the company's restaurants.
In July, pubs and bars groups saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales - but figures revealed that restaurant profits fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, CGA of business consultancy, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant July followed a similar pattern to the previous month of June, when pub sales rose by 2.8 per cent, except that restaurants were hit even harder.
The decline of  1.8 per cent in restaurant turnover in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars with the main beverage sales were the ones that performed best in terms of financial results compared to the previous period while the sales of restaurants decreased.
Pubs whose main selling point is food also suffered from the heat, although not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Apparently, people simply wanted to get drunk.
In managed pubs and bars sales of drinks increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food dropped to three per cent.
Paul Newman, one of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysts said: 'These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the take-away market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are continuing to find it difficult, although a decline in sales of 4.8 per cent year on year will be particularly heavy on top of ongoing cost pressures.
The hot and long summer could not have come at a worse time for operators whose main selling point is food and only time can tell whether the more moderate temperatures experienced in August will provide the much needed rest.
The growth of total sales in pubs and restaurants, including the opening of new businesses, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in the launch of new businesses.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitoring for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with combined revenues of over £9 billion, and is the established benchmark of the industry.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A survey reveals that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of  20,000 secondary school students revealed an increase in  Insta pages
The news has big scares that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a main account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of  20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in following accounts of  Insta - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has big fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of students said they operate a main account presentable to their parents, while having private ones.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old's secret website found a teenager who was encouraging others to rape her - rape me.
Research, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 per cent of young people aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, among which they admit to keeping private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: It is worrying that many young people are afraid to create online spaces where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle to become the 'voice for athletes' at the Scottish Athletics board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated track and field athlete and president Ian Beattie described this change as a great opportunity for sport officials to benefit from her vast experience at an international level over the last decade.
Eilidh is highly respected in the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from her becoming part of the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: 'I am looking forward to acting as a voice for athletes and hope to be able to make a real contribution and help to run sport in Scotland.'
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among his four Olympic gold medals and who is now a regular BBC critic, has been left unable to walk after suffering a minor stroke.
On Twitter he wrote: Like today a month gives me a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if or how far I would recover.
It was a struggle but I recovered completely, learned to swim again and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!
A breast pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows gives rise to different opinions online
A breast pump company has sparked a mixed reaction online with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
On the occasion of the launch of what is considered the world's first wearable, non-noise-reducing breast pump, consumer technology company Elvie released an advertisement inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new pump gives to mothers using the breast pump.
Four real mothers dance in a box filled with cow dung with a disc that includes lyrics like: "Yes, I'm swallowing myself but I don't have a penis" and "In case you haven't noticed these aren't peas but breasts".
The chorus continues: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm bathing my women".
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom said it shed light on the dairy industry's "terrors".
Someone wrote It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth in order to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away within a few days of being born.

Another commented: "It is understandably traumatic for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers holding their babies?
Another added: "Advertising is really cut off from reality".
Others defended the advertisement, with one woman admitting that she found the disc "very amusing".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
If I were still shy, I would have bought one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a little too heavenly but I took it for it.
This is a brilliant product, wrote someone.
Another commented: This is a fun ad aimed at moms who pump (often on their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video the group of women reveal that they were all dancing with blinking pumps placed in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the knowledge that many breast-pumping women say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is noisy, has no wires or tubes and sits within the breast without being visible, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother commented: The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing women who use the breast pump to dairy cows we wanted to draw attention to breast pumping and all the challenges it brings, while showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump has appeared on the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children walk silently to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children increased sharply despite the fact that the border crossing in the month remained largely unchanged, partly because harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration made it more difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, many sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and feared that if they presented themselves to care for a child they would jeopardise their own ability to remain in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the household of  sponsors are here in the country illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
So we are continuing to look for these individuals", said Mr Albence.
To speed up the process involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many will appear via videoconference, rather than in person, to bring arguments in favour of their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for aid will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports that have surfaced from the system in recent months, the more children are held in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or upset, which may lead them to express themselves violently or try to escape.
Lawyers said that this concern is heightened in a larger facility such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is finding it difficult are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying goodbye to their peers can lead to trauma that many of them are already battling.
Syria tells the occupying forces of the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country's war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and will be addressed accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions, he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism" in Syria was almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed since 2011, and millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this holy battle until all terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence are driven out of Syrian territory".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, many of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that led refugees to keep away.
We have asked the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return, he said.
They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a safe zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey avoids a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al-Qaeda, who would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to the revision of the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
In this logic, in 2020 Mr Trump will win re-election as long as, as many liberal viewers are hoping, the denunciation and scandal end his presidency early.
This will undoubtedly be the most dramatic finale ever to take place in a presidency!
So far, it seems that viewers have not been satisfied.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak times, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has increased cable television ratings by as much as 3.5 million viewers on prime-time nights.
"This is a situation that draws people in because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama Designated Survivor, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Why bother me,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
In this chaos there is entertainment value.
Undoubtedly, unlike anything else on TV, the headlines of stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the strength of the global economy.
To ignore what is happening around you is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when on the sixth floor you find yourself following a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of deep-ground sourcing for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather bomber jacket and the implications of Stormy Daniel's drawn descriptions of Mr Trump's anatomy.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what it does to make it look like a reality show is that every night it brings you something", said Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and development in the daily plot of the Trump program (fighting the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss one episode or you'll fall back.
When I contacted Mr Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside his house with a temperature of 80 degrees on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was locked inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't get away from the television, not when Brett Kavanaugh was ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court in a precarious situation.
I remember when we used to do those eccentric programmes and people said, This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, Mr Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but they were actually right.

Large amounts of foreign money coming in for the tightest race in the White House midterm election
It is no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17 congressional districts are seeing a huge amount of money, thanks to a congressional district realignment that acquired two operators in the race for the same seat.
It recently re-established the pits of Pittsburgh's suburban district Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another operator, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which largely extends over the new 17th district.
The maps were re-established after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally overridden in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new seventeen districts provoked a tough campaign finance competition between the finance arms of the main party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in a March special election to Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political critics gave the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. Thought of Penalising El Salvador for Supporting China, Then Decided Not to
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with some help from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a welcoming meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and had a hotel in Panama until some partners fired the Trump Organization's administrative team.
State Department officials decided to re-contact the American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama about recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in US aid, including drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions targeted, would be burdensome for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings began to make progress, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to stem the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to proceed, with the aim of effectively ending any consideration of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been heavily criticized for addressing the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys returned safely to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new and harsh message or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate which were described by the three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were backed up by a foreign analyst close to the administration who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next unanticipated negative event may be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, about which there is now very substantial evidence in the public record.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our elections.
In the event of Congress passing to someone else, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable to that body, as he prepares to once again stand before voters, and perhaps eventually a jury of his peers.
This involves a lot of uncertainty, and I do not intend to suggest that the fall of Mr Trump is inevitable - nor that of his European counterparts.
There are choices to be made by all on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of the fight.
In 1938, German officials were prepared to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, if the West resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history turns with such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Today, Americans face many of these tipping points.
What if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this document reported that, last year, he suggested that the president be recorded secretly and speculated that he was unfit for office.
Mr Rosenstein said that the Times report was inaccurate.
How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation of  Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual misconduct and dishonest testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the term will we vote for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, it will take time for democracy to shift.
But I believe we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadors' home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, 60 years later, on the day of the service, God sent me to light the candles on that table with the swastika.
With such a boom, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic ahead of the competitive game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, following their equally impressive result in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season in the 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can use that result as a catalyst for great things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something and we came out with a point.
We probably won it towards the end but, all in all, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half of the game while we went better in the second half.
Thursday will once again be a great European evening.
We hope we can get three points but it will be difficult because they had a good result in their last game but, with the crowd behind us, I am sure we can continue to do our best and get a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, with everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but despite this there is a sense of positivity at the moment.
The team is good and the boys are having a lot of fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can now do our best, forget about last season and succeed.
Women are concerned about this fear related to retirement saving
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be ordained, few people were talking to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
People want a family member to look out for them, but they aren't taking the steps to have a conversation, said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance business at  Nationwide.
You should start like this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide care if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counsellor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as those choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial adviser: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a cash value to help cover these costs or self-insurance from your own pocket - as long as you have the money.
Make a decision after discussing your legal documents at length: Avoid legal battles.
Find a healthcare proxy to choose a reliable person to supervise your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
In addition, consider a power of attorney for your finances.
Choose a person you trust to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medicine and allergies?
Explain these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
It is not just the finances that are involved, but who are the doctors? said Martin.
What are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
See that that plan is ready.
Man shot multiple times by air-gun fire in Fracombe
A man was shot several times by an air-gun as he walked home after dark outside.
The victim, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the abdomen and chest.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have appealed to witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With damage to communication lines, aid officials could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, which is an area in the North of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of  Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital city of Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of  Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under a province, had a population of  approximately 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck the western side of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently hit by earthquakes.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province on the northern tip of Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits South Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a powerful tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A low-level earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's northern side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest child arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone away.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured bond of  $500, the KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "certainly, not guilty" when asked to give his reason, the network reported.
Palin is facing three Class A felonies, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been made against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016 he was charged with domestic assault, interfering with a domestic violence crime report, and having a weapon in his possession while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend alleged that her punch hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after comparisons were made between her son's violent behavior and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) resulting from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working with the number of deaths expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside the center of Sulawesi, which lies to the north of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the moment of impact are circulating in the media.
Hundreds of people were gathering for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore with great force.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the suspect in the NYC terrorist attack be given the rare death penalty
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, be given the death penalty - a rare punishment not carried out in the state for a federal offense since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a bicycle lane attack along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, shooting pedestrians and cyclists who had turned in his path in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious physical harm, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of  New York.
According to the court document, these two heads of prosecution carry a possible death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts that included eight counts of murder with the aid of an organized riot squad, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Describing the manner in which Saipov carried out this "bloody, cruel and immoral" attack, prosecutors said the attack required "substantial advance planning and meditation".
The letter of intent states that Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage, and loss to the families and friends of  Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.'
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last brought a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually given a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being found guilty of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his mobile phone, according to the head of the prosecution.
He also requested that an ISIS flag be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they are "certainly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea for life in prison without the possibility of parole will only further prolong the trauma of these events for all involved, Patton said.
Saipov's defense team previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians had to feel under pressure from the Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party government member Peter Bone told the Birmingham demonstration that the UK would have been out by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge facing Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided positions has been highlighted by anti-Brexit Tories who joined a separate anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is finding it difficult to keep her Chequers compromise plan on track amid attacks from Brexiteers, anti-Brexiters and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash she would continue to push ahead to try to reach an agreement with Brussels - forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour party to choose between her package and chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to scrap the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should be given a high social position and should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would have been out by now", he said.
MEP Wellingborough added: 'I will defend Brexit but we need to reject the Chequers plan.'
When declaring that he was against the EU, he said: We do not fight world wars to serve me.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay  is absolutely not true.
Andrea Jenkyns, Tory Brexiteer, was also present for the demonstration, telling journalists: 'I want to say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers' plan is unpopular with the general public, the Opposition will not vote for it, unpopular with our party and our activists who are really the ones who go out into the streets and vote for us first.
Please forget the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she said: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should feel under pressure if they were to reverse the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class, he said.
They are trying to get back out of Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let you go if you do.
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd he said: 'I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is on the brink of reversing Brexit.
We are mobilising in Brexit the people's army of this country that has brought us success and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit demonstrators marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Following the group's launch this weekend, a small number of activists held banners reading Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, who holds a high social position in the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered from as the conference opened.
These are the people who tell us that they can have the IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada and beyond, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland, he added.
This is a complete farce.
The idea of a good Brexit does not exist, he added.
Warren intends to carefully consider the possibility of running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday the Massachusetts Democratic Party member spoke about her future at a municipal-level citizen debate in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign co-chair in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with constituents who have been using the municipal-level citizen debate format since Trump took office.
A person attending the meeting asked her if she intended to run for the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our fragmented government, and that includes a woman at the top.
An arrest has been made in connection with the shooting death of LSU Sims
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, La., announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an 11 a.m. ET news conference.
On Friday they released a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the man who appears in the video.
Sims, 20, was killed in a plane crash near the University of the South campus Friday morning.
According to 247sports, on Saturday police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Wayde Sims suffered a head injury and eventually died as a result.
Wayde came to his partner's defense and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, to having a weapon, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 kid from Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closes in on world title after his team's orders saw him win against Sebastian Vettel
On Saturday, from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a big part in the race.
From the position on the inside of the front row, Bottas had a good advantage and almost abandoned Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel was the first to enter the stopping areas and allowed Hamilton to race with the others in last place of the group, something that was to be decisive.
Mercedes stopped in the parking area after another lap and exited just behind Vettel, but Hamilton continued after some wheel to wheel action which led to the Ferrari driver barely leaving the inside free due to the risk of falling back after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh until the end of the first lap when he was ejected at the age of 21.
He then was in the lead for most of the race by not changing his tyres with the aim of finishing fast and overtaking Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the break zone on lap 44 but could not increase his pace on the remaining eight laps as Raikkonen entered in fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a really good job all weekend and he was really kind to let me by.
The team did a really exceptional job to get first and second place, said Hamilton.
That Was a Very Bad Physical Attitude
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "violent and disgusting and insincere".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and cowardly and disgusting and insincere", he said.
When you look at statements and disclosures and then say no, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you uncover any information?
Remember her answer... I found the document - e, e, what?
No you won't.
I didn't find anything.
Look, wait a minute.
We have... No, we have not", he added, imitating the Senator.
Feinstein sent her the letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was revealed earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the revelation came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't reveal her story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as she requested.
But her refusal seems not to have been well received by the president, who commented during the Saturday evening rally: 'You know, that was a really bad physical attitude.
I may not have figured it out, but that's the worst physical behavior I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the vile, the disgusting, they don't care about the hurt, the people who are being pushed around in circles to gain power and control", the president said according to reports from Mediaite.
The team is currently playing in the Premier League.
Patrick Dwyer double for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars compensated for their Elite League of the Week loss to Belfast Giants by winning the game against the same opponent 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained a two-goal lead early in the game with two strikes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the same score before Dwyer regained the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored the same for Dundee before two goals from  Lukas Lundvald Nielsen confirmed their victory.
This was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe's players, who after several defeats advanced to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday evening.
This was the fourth time this season that these two teams have met, with the Giants winning their last three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a pass from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford passing while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was an action-packed opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed Cownie at 15:16 which brought the same score for both teams.
Dwyer ensured the Giants' lead into the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team reunited and again thanks to Bouchard they beat the other team with a strong goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give Dundee their first-ever lead in the game late in the second period and secure the fifth goal win for his side in the half-final.
Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Dies to Ensure Hundreds of People on Plane Can Escape the Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being hailed as a hero after he died to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to land safely.
More than 800 people died and many were missing after a massive earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong riots remain in the area and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues running to his rescue, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position in the control tower he was standing in at Palu Airport, Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained calm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could take off safely.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to crash.
He died later in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we left this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"When we hear about this, we feel very sad", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands with the country's disaster mitigation agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
It is estimated that the number is still rising as many bodies were still under the rubble while many could not be reached, said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The 20-foot-high wave destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance was carrying the body.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are thriving everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working tirelessly to help those who are still alive but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete any tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?  reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says man missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that was operating a crashed Pacific lagoon flight in Micronesia now says a man is missing, after previously saying all 47 passengers and crew members had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it could not provide details on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boatmen helped to rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the US Navy both said that the aircraft landed in the lagoon a few miles away from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had skipped the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"This is a really good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the high water to the emergency exit on the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and shouting, and that he suffered a minor injury to his head.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a pier also helped with the rescue by using a lifeboat to carry the passengers to shore before the plane sank in about 100 feet (30 m) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that over the past two decades 111 people have died in airline accidents recorded by PNG but no accident involved Air Niugini.
An analyst presents a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
On Saturday the prosecution concluded its evidence on the case in the retrial of a man who is accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice Analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the cell phone records to piece together information about the movements of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the cell phone data showed that he was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak to Sanford.
Sanford spoke on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying, since my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records indicated they had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phone calls and contact information from his mobile phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defense is scheduled to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to move to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop conscious?
Three hip hop artists must challenge the negative perspective of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved beyond its origins of political messages and is addressing social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make hip hop consciously popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
Nanny from NY congratulates couple for being fired after racist message
A nanny from New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a mistaken message from the mother who was complaining that she was another black person.
The couple deny being racist, and compare the case to extortion.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed regret when it became known that the new childcare worker, Giselle Maurice, was dark-skinned on her first day at work in 2016.
"Here's another black person", wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Madame Maurice, twice.
After realizing her gross mistake, Plasco-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her previous nanny, who was African-American, had not done her job well and that she was waiting for the Philippines instead, according to the New York Post.
Ms Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation in respect of the dismissal, and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for the six-month live-in position for which she was initially employed, despite being without a contract.
I want to show them, listen, you can't do things like this", she told the Post on Friday, adding "I know this is discrimination".
The couple attacked the racist claims, saying that firing Ms. Maurice was the most reasonable thing they could do, fearing they could not trust her after offending her.
Marti sent her something she didn't intend to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist people", Joel Plasco told Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone who spoke to you in a rude way, even if it was a mistake?
Your unborn baby?
And here we go.
Comparing the case to "extortion", Plasco said that it had been only two months since his wife had given birth and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you accuse someone like that?
It is not a nice thing to do, adds the investment banker.
While the legal case was still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly announced the couple on social media, insulting them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared that readers would not relate to a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's reading it for the first time before it's published.
It's really funny that we now know what we know about the huge success of Paddington.
She said her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write the children's book by a young toy bear, would certainly have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "pleasant but somewhat marred by grief" following his death last year.
On Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family", she added that her father was proud of his eventual success although he never spoke about it.
"He was a quiet man, and he was not self-confident", she said.
But since Paddington was so real to him, it was like having a child who achieves something: be proud of them even if you didn't achieve something.
I think he was looking at Paddington's success that way.
Although he was his own creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to give her a final hello on the phone
Upon her arrival, her daughter was immediately taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked to save her life but to no avail.
Nad was calling regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad, that he was not expected to live, said Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I received a phone call from Nad telling me that she would die in the next two minutes and that I had to give her a final goodbye.
And I did.
I told her, Tashi, I love you very much, my dear.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart beating were running low and slowly leaving her system.
She had died some time before and started to fall apart.
All I could do was sit and wait, aware that all this was happening.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to hold back really.
Eventually, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I had my head down, and tears flowed down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a strong sense of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and to be loved.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards of mourning women to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost a loved one to suicide are working to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys were putting up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call for support.
Tyler, Mrs Davis' son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, of Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.
However, he had to stop working before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler, then 11, was the one who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said: "I'm always afraid that this will be the cause of another horrible event".
Ms Davis created the cards to let people know that there are people you can open up to or meet, even as a friend.
Don't keep quiet - you need to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs Davies, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, not long after the death of his mother.
"He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his attitude.
Christmas Day was really bad - when the kids opened their presents he didn't make any eye contact or anything.
She said his death was a great trauma for them, but they want to fight it: It leaves a void in the family.
It divides us.
But we all have to keep going and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in shambles as the FBI begins an investigation
"I said, if we could get something like what he asked for - a limited investigation in time, limited in purpose - maybe we would have brought some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "getting bogged down in a deep-rooted partisan paralysis".
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI investigating?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on 6 November - if, as expected, the Republicans do not do well, then they will severely weaken their attempts to put down the man they want elected to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush was on the phone to the senators, to persuade them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI submits its report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently hold office.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Mike Pence, the vice president, to vote and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors is decreasing under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Quoting data from the South's unification ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 party changes last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates demanded by human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Many of them flee by going through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two parts of Korea.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on halting denuclearisation talks.
This followed the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in broad terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho lashed out at US sanctions for the lack of progress that has been made since then.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally, Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Mr. Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperamental behavior.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever behaved like that, they would have said hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still young.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and bursting into tears when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him "grotesque and coordinated assassination" organized by liberals who are angry that Hilary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, because it showed he had prejudices against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he went after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi spoke out when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not only to be on the Supreme Court, but even to be on the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Currently Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as it is considered conservative justice.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reverse certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not my place for a person with hysterical prejudices to go to court and expect to be told, 'Very good,'" Pelosi said.
And Women Need to Exercise Their Authority
It's a fair verbal attack, months and years of anger, and she can't say what to say without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think this is rare, do you?
She added, "I met a lot of women who were stuck somewhere else, who said that she cried when she was angry, but developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You probably think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm pissed off.
And then it didn't stop.
And I thought this was something brilliant.
Crying is allowed as a way to vent one's great anger in part because it is fundamentally misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself crying in indescribable anger, was when an older woman - a cold manager I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the collarbone and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and are happy that they managed to hurt you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart when he was running for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat known as the Monkey Business and was voted out of office, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, concluded that there was no reason why she should not explore the idea of running for president herself.
"This was not a well-thought-out decision", she said with a laugh 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates running for office, and the last thing they wanted was another candidate.
Some call it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was back in fundraising, so she swore she would not run for reelection unless she made $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she said.
When she made her speech announcing that she was not going to launch a formal campaign, she was so emotional - grateful to the people who supported her, angry at the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters instead of delegates, and angry at sexism - that she choked.
I probably thought I had such strong brakes, Ms Schroeder recalled about the way the media reacted to her.
I thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
Is she crying?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The aerial bombing numbers of the opening of the US-China trade war were staggering, and while the battle is still to be won, a disagreement between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
The Commission has also examined whether the measures in question are likely to have a significant impact on the Union industry's financial situation.
The most significant increase came this week with new tariffs affecting goods amounting to $200 billion (£150 billion), effectively taxing all goods entering the US from China.
Beijing has reacted in the same way each time, while more recently it has been introducing tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has promised to agree with the US every time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to give in anytime soon.
Washington's backing down means it accepts the demands, but publicly China's surrender to the United States will be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts say that if Beijing acts wisely, the US trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic chaos in both countries is in fact far more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged, said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research partner at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that targeted their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime welcomes help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he will not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that sponsored the sedition.
Europe embraces the Ryder Cup win in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup against Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson who is a prominent player in the United States, who has been playing throughout the tournament, made his water kick on the 16th par-3 hole, thus giving up his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the lowest level player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World-class player Dustin Johnson took 2 for 1 for England's Ian Poulter who played in his Ryder Cup final.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Spain's Sergio Garcia became the tournament's all-time leading European player with a career-high of 25.5 points.
I don't normally cry but today I couldn't help it.
It was a difficult year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have my cup back.
The team is everything, and I am happy to have been able to help", said Garcia, emotionally moved after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram who beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles play on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud, having beaten Tiger Woods, when I was raising him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a career Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Strange statistics from one of the greatest players to ever play here, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find those parts of the course where golf would be played with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
US captain Jim Furyk spoke after a disappointing performance for his team, "I'm proud of these men, they fight.
There was a time this morning when we were putting some pressure on Europe.
We argued.
Thomas, we take our hat off to you.
He is a very good captain.
His 12 players played very well.
We're gonna get back together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna move forward.
I love these 12 young men and am proud to be their captain.
You should take your hat and shave your head.
He's better than her.
Red Tide update: Concentrations are declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decrease in Red Tide concentrations for parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, conditions of algal overgrowth in isolated areas are being reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - suggesting decreased concentrations.
The Red Tide which is an overgrowth of algae extends about 130 miles of coastline from the upper Pinellas to the lower Lee countries.
Isolated areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but at fewer sites related to the past week.
Red Tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Medium concentrations near the coast or off the coast of Pinellas County were reported in the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations near the coast or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations near the coast or off the coast of Lee County, and background to low concentrations in Collier County.
Respiratory irritation continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation was reported in Northwest Florida during the past week.
