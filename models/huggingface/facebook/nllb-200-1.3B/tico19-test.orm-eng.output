The coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom increased rapidly from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The overall coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom is showing similar patterns, varying in degree depending on the country, but COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness to respond to COVID-19 patients who require treatment, and specifically those who require specialized treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a patient with an unidentified pneumonia strain was reported from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Center for Health Prevention and Control reported that the strain of the new coronavirus is now classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Later, the disease resulting from the detection of SARS-CoV-2 was renamed as coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
According to the latest evidence, 80% of COVID-19 patients will have mild symptoms, meaning that they will be able to cope with the disease regardless of whether they have respiratory pneumonia.
In more than 14% of cases, COVID-19 is a serious illness requiring hospitalization and the remaining 6% of cases are severe illnesses requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 is over 4%.
In this study, we compared the overall COVID-19 prevalence of the countries (EU/EEA) and (UK) with that of China, Hubei Province.
We will again compare COVID-19 cases with EU/EEA and UK in Italy from January 31-March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK
With the exception of China, COVID-19 has spread beyond geographical areas and the current strong COVID-19 epidemic in the rest of the world is following that of the country.
On March 11, 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, the case of EuroSurveillance 2020, spiter et al. was reported as the first case of COVID-19 in Europe according to the World Health Organization's patient definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, and between 31 December 2019 and the date inclusive, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
It is accepting COVID-19 patients as a statistical and diagnostic centre
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reports the worldwide COVID-19 case count, which is reported by official sources such as the Ministry of Health, local and national health authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO), every day at 8:00 a.m.
The data was used to estimate the COVID-19 trend in the EU/EEA and the UK, and then to reconcile with Italy.
In the case of COVID-19 cases, we calculated a 14-day shorter total of COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural source of COVID-19, for each EU/EEA country and UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
As of March 15, 2020, 8:00 a.m., we have provided the data on the number of isolated cases in Italy for the period January 31-March 15, 2020.
General COVID-19 outbreaks in EU/EEA and UK
The 14-day follow-up to the EU/EEA and UK COVID-19 cases was followed by the Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and UK as a whole, COVID-19 admissions began to rise on 21 February and increased significantly on 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This is all driven by the rapidly increasing number of cases in Italy, but countries including EU/EEA and UK are seeing similar cases of COVID-19 (Additional material).
Figure 2 shows the statistics of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
As of 8 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK reported the same number of cases as Italy in a three-week period.
Our data shows that the number of COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
He suggested that the global pandemic continues at the same rate in all countries, in the context of the overall slowly increasing COVID-19 infection.
This includes different levels of countries, variations in national public health responses, and different processes to identify patients tested for COVID-19.
In early March 2020, Italian doctors in the affected areas reported that more than 10% of COVID-19 patients require specialized medical care and that hospitals and specialized health services are overcrowded, media sources reported.
Information on hospitalization of COVID-19 patients and/or special treatment is currently available at the EU/EEA level of only 6% and 1% of patients, respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be encouraged to systematically monitor the current data that focuses on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010-11 study revealed that the availability of specialized health care and emergency care varies across Europe, with Germany having between 29.2 and 4.2 beds per 100,000 people.
This means that countries could have more resources than Italy (12.5 special health care facilities and emergency beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
A comparative healthcare capacity stability model, one-to-one estimates for EU/EEA countries and the UK for the same proportion of COVID-19 patients of related age group hospitalized; the risk of overuse of intensive care bed capacity &gt;90%, is presented in the six-month revision of the COVID-19 Emergency Prevention Report at the ECDC.
As patients in the EU/EEA and UK are collected locally and hospitals and specialised health services are regularly available to the local population, information on patients and specialised health services is available in the borderline body statistics 2 (NUTS-2) database.
The experience from Italy and what is now happening in other countries shows that COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and specialty clinics must prepare for the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, and special treatment, such as that currently underway in parts of Italy and Italian regions.
According to the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, rapid response is essential to promptly trigger vaccinations and to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, as well as shifting from control to immediate improvement, as the rapid increase in the expected number of cases may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to properly assess, respond and adapt to the situation if not implemented early.
Prompt risk management also lowers the level of public health to reduce the impact of the epidemic.
Emergency opportunities are diminishing as countries increase their immunization efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the impact of healthcare.
This fall, the healthcare systems of EU/EEA countries will receive a large number of patients requiring specialized treatment within days or weeks of departure.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already killed 3,000 people and affected 80,000 in China and continues to pose a serious threat to humanity worldwide.
A similar virus, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands of people with SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by bats and can exhibit similar symptoms in a similar way.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and less likely to cause death than SARS but is more transmissible and affects younger, older and more male than female.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on emerging diseases, this article seeks to provide a timeline of the most rapidly developing fields of study.
We cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, symptom testing, treatment, diagnosis, and prevention of disease.
While many questions remain to be answered, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eliminate the dreaded disease.
The 25th of January 2020 was the first and most memorable holiday for all Chinese who spent several weeks at home due to the new virus pandemic.
The virus was the precursor to the coronavirus (CoV) outbreak that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and thus, SARS-CoV-2 was named by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020, and the related diseases were named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 countries worldwide.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has been detected in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and 3,000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization (WHO) warns that COVID-19 is more dangerous than pandemic No. 1 and terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers were produced on COVID-19 from the date of the first report on January 7, 2020, when the virus was isolated from several patients.
The review attempts to match the results of the study with the new and rapidly developing field of study.
Where possible, we will try to counter COVID-19 SARS and the CoV-induced diseases, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS outbreak in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and progression of disease, as well as a few remaining but important questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal, causing up to 4 cases per 15 percent of cases.
However, in this century, two human-caused variants of CoVs have been introduced, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, followed by conflicts, and immediately spread to many other countries with epidemics and deaths.
Thus, the current COVID-19 pandemic is the third CoV outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the China National Health Commission from Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
The CoV process was discontinued after seven days.
On January 15, 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
As a result, the plague quickly spread to cities, towns, and neighboring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that the perception of healthcare providers suggested that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan was closed, including public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical trial of the disease reported that of the 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which is thought to have originated from an unknown animal.
On January 30, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread to China and 50 countries worldwide (RW.2).
As the situation develops rapidly, the final extent and severity of the pandemic will be estimated.
On February 11, 2020, the Ministry of Health released an updated epidemiological data including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 8,866 patients as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 affects people of all ages, but is most prevalent in those aged 30-65.
Up to half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, the majority were under 20, and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 has affected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 is most prevalent in the Hubei Group and Province.
It takes an average of 5 (2-9) days after starting to test for COVID-19.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from arrest to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the R0 adjusted was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases was consistent with the high travel period prior to January 23, 2020, during the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the mortality rate was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%) of all patients.
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a branch of the large, membrane-bound virus family that includes a coiled membrane that is RNA-specific.
They can be divided into four genes, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which only alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
Envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell surface of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), respectively for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then binds to form a membrane.
The viral RNA gene is encoded in the cytoplasm; after the viral gene is replicated, the RNA is transported to the membrane-bound glycoprotein gene and forms a nucleocapsid-containing protein that envelops the viral group, then fuses with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on January 10, 2020.
In 10 samples from the site, SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel beta-CoV with 99.98% genetic identification, at Hunan Wuhan Seafood Market.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.
Micro-organisms of SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in the epithelium of the human respiratory tract by electron microscopy.
ACE2 has been found to be a potential human immunosuppressant for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more closely associated with the human ACE2 deficiency, which is related to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has a lower detectability of malignancy in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may also activate a new short protein coated by orf3b and a generated protein coated by orf8.
orf3b SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in viral transmission and may exhibit IFNβ signaling; however, orf8β does not have a known host.
On February 18, 2020, Zhu, et al., reported a complex of the human-derived amino acid B0AT1 in the cryo-EM ACE2 2.9 molecule.
They found that the complex, which has both open and closed structures, is dimer-like and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for detecting and diagnosing COVID-19.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for the antibody used to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Basic and intermediate batches
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to originate from night owls and are transmitted to humans primarily through the larvae and camels.
In comparison to other phylogenetic SARS-CoV-2 CoVs, bats as carriers of SARS-CoV-2 are inherited as the primary 96% of new SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the time frame for when the multi-species virus was transmitted and how it was transmitted remained unknown, and the route of transmission has yet to be determined.
Ji, et al., suggested that the virus was transmitted from the night-bird to humans by a process in which the DNA fragments in the S protein are broken down and recombined to produce new allele compounds that are identical.
In a report, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that long-horned, cat-eating pangolins, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the central secretory vectors of SARS-CoV-2 based on the homology of 99% of the CoVs found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genes is still a large difference; therefore, evidence-based results are awaited (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a vector for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and for up to 5 days at 20 °C and a moisture content of 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 should show similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and to be kept at 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol ether, an insecticide containing chlorine, paracetic acid, chloroform, and cocoa butter, but not chlorohexide, can weaken the virus.
The human genome is vulnerable to new viruses because it has a high immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
At this time, no detailed studies on the immunity response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Therefore, we only look at the previous data on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, after the virus is transmitted, the person's innate immune system is initially recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
In various ways, the virus stimulates the production of blood clots, dendritic cells, and type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis.
However, the N protein may help the SARS-CoV virus escape the immune response.
Recently, the response of the coronavirus has been combined with the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, play an important role in the immune system.
CD4+ T cells produce B cells to produce antibodies based on specific virus, while CD8+ T cells directly kill the virus-sensitive cells.
T-cell helper cytokines produce an antibody that helps the immune system.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell replication by stimulating T cell self-replication.
The immunity of the body to the C3a and C5a receptors and the incorporation of the antibodies is crucial to preventing the virus.
For example, antibodies taken from a healthy patient can transmit MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overeating can cause excessive inflammation of the lungs and other organs, producing high radial counts, and, if severe, can lead to multiple organ damage and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by a cumulative onset, is more likely to affect older adults with increased risk and pregnant women.
Of course, people who are exposed to various viruses or who have immunological problems are more likely to contract than other patients.
The incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 symptoms is 1-14 days, typically 3-7 days based on a study of 425 people in Wuhan.
However, the total of 1,099 cases indicates that the average time without symptoms can be from 3 days and 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as presented above, showed the incubation period to be 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 patients.
A timely diagnosis of the disease cycle is essential for health officials, as it prevents transmission from infected to asymptomatic individuals.
As a general rule, people who are exposed to or diagnosed with the virus should generally be quarantined for only 14 days.
Should the isolation period be longer than 24 days?
Body aches are usually the first and most common symptom of COVID-19, with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, sore throat, hair growth, chest pain, vomiting, heartburn and diarrhea.
Some patients have symptoms of breathing difficulties and/or shortness of breath in the blood after a week of exposure.
In severe cases, the patient quickly develops symptoms of severe respiratory distress, inflammatory bowel disease, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with physical illness and/or respiratory symptoms and severe illness, but no evidence of malaria, should be tested for the virus at the initial screening.
Of the public health screening at the end of December 2019, 98% of the symptoms were fever, 76% were cough, 55% were difficulty breathing, and 3% were heartburn; 8% of patients required ventilation support.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies in a family group and a transmission group in parents without symptoms.
In comparison, a 2012 population study showed that MERS-CoV patients had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and shortness of breath (55%) as their initial symptoms.
However, more than 80% of COVID-19 patients require respiratory assistance, and the death toll from MERS COVID-19 is relatively high.
The rash (26%) and sore throat (21%) of MERS patients may be associated.
In SARS patients, physical fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), difficulty breathing (40%-42%), chest pain (20-25%), and joint pain (13-25%) were suggested as the primary symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed for up to 14%-20% of patients.
Prior to February 14, when 66,576 cases were confirmed worldwide, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS in November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 suspected cases.
For MERS, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases, based on public health data from June 2012.
A new study reports that SARS-CoV-2's R0n is detected at a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, and SARS-CoV's R0n is only detected between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with respect to their symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above image suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher transmission capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but both are less virulent.
Therefore, the control of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks is more robust than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Group capture is always appointed within the same family or in the same collection or on a cruise.
Patients typically have a history of travel or residents from Wuhan or other contaminated areas or have had contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before exposure.
However, it has been reported that infected individuals may remain symptom-free for more than two weeks and recovered patients may be hospitalized again, sending a warning message to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or reduced white blood cell counts (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, the white blood cell count of lymphopenia is between &lt;4×109/L and the lymphocyte count of &lt;1×109/L, and also includes elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and kidney enzymes and hemoglobin are increased in the blood of some patients, and a concentration of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes is found in the blood of some patients.
In severely ill patients, levels of D-dimer, a decreasing chemical in the blood, increased, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
Unusual lesions in the chest cavity are found in more than half of COVID-19 patients and are characterized by scattered or darkly discolored lumps in the lungs.
Patients often present with unknown pulmonary fibrosis, sudden pneumonic injury, and sudden respiratory symptoms.
During ARDS, uncontrolled bleeding, fluid accumulation, and fibrosis are all reduced by the ongoing deterioration of air circulation.
Phydelamine reduces the level of exposure to type I and type II nematodes and increases the risk of infection, thereby reducing the respiratory capacity of the malaria and increasing the risk of malaria infection.
Thus, the discovery of a bad radiograph is always accompanied by the severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, a randomized analysis of the pathological evidence for COVID-19 showed nucleoside rupture, hyaluronic membrane formation, and multinucleate synaptic cells in the lung of patients who died of the disease, in a study of viral infection and in combination with ARDS and SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is used as the primary criterion for testing for COVID-19.
However, due to the high level of false negatives, which could exacerbate the outbreak, a clinical trial (not based on RT-PCR) was launched in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed in the SARS test.
Therefore, the collection of disease history, clinical evidence, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and crucial for effective diagnosis.
On January 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team developed a SHERLOCK CRISPR-based method for the use of the SARS-CoV-2 inhibitory mechanism, which is divided into 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (weight 10-100 microlitres) and seeks only a detailed estimation of SARS-CoV-2 RNA without the use of any other instrument.
A new technique, once proven in clinical trials, can dramatically improve feelings and reception.
Due to the lack of shared novel CoV experience, healthcare providers are more likely to provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, when they have used antibodies to specific strains or previously treated antibodies intended for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral-derived diseases (Gabatee (Gabatee2).2).
These include current and powerful antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, hormonal steroids, plasma from obese patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Plasma from the patient's bone marrow was donated for medical use.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines.
SARS-CoV-2 initially infects most of the lungs and, in smaller amounts, may also infect other ACE2-expressing organs, such as the liver and pancreas and the kidneys.
However, weakening of the respiratory system and falling can cause serious damage and death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is critical to alleviate symptoms and save life as well as general oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, continuous respiration, and special respiration depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with respiratory symptoms should be assisted with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a cardiopulmonary bypass technique that improves the response to heart attacks and pulmonary embolism.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and control of secondary infection and septic shock, and critical organ care are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytotoxicity is known to be caused by severe inflammation of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytocin storming is a wound response process involving the cytocin sequence TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1 f.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are a major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
A reduced body mass is important in the production of cytokines, especially in patients with advanced disease.
Corticosteroids and tossilizumab, monoclonal antibodies against IL6, are used to treat cytostoma.
Other cytokine-dependent inhibitors that are activated by T cell-mediated immunity response are IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF inhibitors; JAK inhibitors; bilinatumob; cytokine signaling inhibitors 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used to treat the severity of wounds in SARS infections.
However, overdose steroids are not useful for patients affected by SARS and COVID-19.
There, serious injuries, especially vascular osteonecrosis, have a dramatic effect on diagnosis.
However, short-term, low-to-medium-dose corticosteroids are recommended for use in people who are severely ill with COVID-19.
At the time of writing, the effectiveness of the vaccine against the virus has not been confirmed.
However, the combination of remdesivir and blood cell sequencing, nucleotides, was confirmed to be critical in the COVID-19 case in the United States.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead at the beginning of the Ebola and Marlburg virus fight.
Later, remdesivir also showed potential resistance to other viral RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has supplied the compound to China for intensive clinical trials in people diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are maintained at high levels.
In addition, barisimib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are prescribed as a stronger co-administration for patients with respiratory system problems.
Heart attack, heartburn, inflammation, liver damage, and other complications may occur with treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction with canine and other medications used by the patient should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from the patient's plasma and antibody source.
The practice of harvesting blood from cured patients and using it to treat people with the same disease or to prevent infection has a long history.
In fact, people who are resistant to disease always have a large immune system that detects pathogens in their blood.
Immune immunoglobulin (Ig) proteins are B lymphocytes that are produced to fight off pathogens and other foreign invaders and they detect specific molecules in pathogens and directly attack them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from a group of COVID-19 patients and given to 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improve within 24 hours, reducing the severity of the disease and associated with the level of the virus and oxygen in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary to ensure that the technique is widely applied until the specific conflict has developed.
In addition, depending on the side effects of the drug, some plasma-related side effects should be considered with caution.
For example, aniobody can stimulate an over-exercise immune response and cell division signaling, which is more likely to be life-threatening by acidic forces.
The number of exogenous cells in the blood is usually low, and the need for plasma is high for the treatment of many patients with the disease.
It is extremely difficult to develop and produce enough antibiotics to quickly eradicate the global epidemic.
It is therefore critical and applicable for identifying B cells from the infected host and for modifying the genetic code of an effective antibiotic or antibody to a critical protein present in the opposite virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of foreign antibodies.
TCM has been used in China to treat various diseases for thousands of years.
However, the most significant risk is the combination of the body formula based on the TCM-based diagnostic method.
Many determinants remain unknown or difficult to identify and confirm the entity or combination.
At present, the lack of specific treatment for COVID-19 has made TCM a critical component for patients with mild to moderate symptoms and severe illness.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lin Hua Qing Wen drugs have been found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The treatment rate of COVID-19 patients in most regions of China that use TCM in 87% of their families, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninjia (50%) and Hunan (50%), and Hubei Province, which only uses TCM for nearly 30% of its COVID-19 patients, has a low treatment rate (13%).
However, this is subject to other factors such as the number and severity of the test compared to the test.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study of Western medicine (WM) and TCM.
They found that the time needed to improve body temperature, reduce symptoms, and send to the hospital for treatment was dramatically less in the WM+TCM group than in the WM+TCM group alone.
Surprisingly, the rate of symptom deterioration (from mild to severe) is surprisingly lower for the WM+TCM group alone (7.4% to 46.2%) and the mortality rate is lower for the WM+TCM group alone (8.8% to 39%).
However, the safety and usefulness of TCM is still expected to be a large-scale practice in the wider centre.
It may be of additional interest to clarify the techniques of practice and the effectiveness of TCM or, if possible, a combination of these.
Patients with COVID-19 are more likely to fear infection and death than those suspected or known to have it, and those who are isolated develop feelings of boredom, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms such as fever, lack of oxygen, and cough, as well as the effects of the fight-or-flight response, such as sleep deprivation, can lead to anxiety and mental retardation.
In the early stages of SARS onset, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, recurrent seizures, anxiety, fear of injury, pleasure from mental activities, symptoms of psychosis, psychiatric disorders, and even self-harm have been reported.
Mandatory contact and isolation, as part of the public health response to the spread of COVID-19, can lead to public fear and feelings of punishment about the impact of the spread, isolation, and rejection by family and friends.
Therefore, mental health services should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspects, and those in contact with them and to the relevant public.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health groups, timely and timely updates of contact information about the onset of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and in-person communication interventions.
Effective vaccination of mosquitoes from animal sources and infected individuals to susceptible populations is essential to the ongoing control of emerging infections of terrestrial viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines that can mediate the immune response and/or maintain long-term immunity to SARS-CoV.
Vaccines made from living viruses have been tested for SARS in animal models.
However, the efficacy of the vaccine in the elderly and its impact-resistance model for the zoonotic virus should be determined prior to clinical trials.
This is because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new infection has been found since.
In comparison, the unusual and persistent incidence of MERS in the Middle East and the spread of zoonotic diseases from the region to other regions.
The vaccine for MERS has been developed using non-science viruses, DNA plasmids, viral bacteria, nanoparticles, viral-like materials and target protein components and a few animal models.
Vaccination of people with low immunity to SARS-CoV-2 should be urgent, and so should the cessation of the ongoing epidemic.
However, the long time (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the mutation of CoVs is hard to eliminate.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun its full clinical trials with thousands of patients being diagnosed.
In many cases, patients can survive almost without any other symptoms.
However, like SARS and MERS, and COVID-19 in critically ill patients, the incidence of disease and death is increasing.
Therefore, building predictive models for disease is essential for healthcare agencies to prioritize services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on the results of previous clinical trials, the following effects should be noted or combined with symptomatic testing for COVID-19 patients (Gabate (Gabate33):
Age: Age is a major factor in the diagnosis of SARS, as is COVID-19.
The majority of COVID-19 cases occurred in the 30-65 age group, of which 47.7% of the 8,866 cases reported above were patients over 50 years of age.
Patients who require special medical care may have more complications and are older than others (average age 66 and 51), which is considered the age of onset of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 affected more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Post-infectious diseases and complications: Co-infectious COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are at increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest and cardiac arrest.
Heart attacks were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be behind ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver damage in COVID-19 patients.
It takes understanding that age and other disabilities are strongly intertwined and can conflict.
Unverified laboratory tests: Deterioration of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the blood indicates disease or tissue damage to the tissue, which is suggested to be a risk factor for disease, regeneration, and resistance.
The relationship between CRP and COVID-19 research was also presented.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help to mediate the effect.
These enzymes are expressed by many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during tissue injury.
Therefore, it is a traditional indicator for heart and liver damage.
Major clinical signs: Chest prognosis and sustained clinical signs should be considered along with other factors for prognosis and for additional complications caused by COVID-19.
The benefits of steroids: As mentioned above, steroids for the control of blood flow are always used to treat seizures and reduce the damage to the wound.
After high doses of corticosteroids were used to treat a large proportion of SARS patients, many obese people developed anemia, age-related disability and declining quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, a short-term course of astroids should also be given to patients with mild forms of COVID-19.
Depression: As mentioned above, during the onset of COVID-19, many patients experienced severe depression due to prolonged isolation and unpredictable conditions and because they witnessed the deaths of close family members and patients' friends.
Psychological counseling and long-term support are essential to help patients recover from their stress and return to a normal life.
According to the latest population census, COVID-19 differs from SARS in its epidemiological characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 is as common as the infectious strain CoVs, which are capable of reproducing in the lower respiratory tract, but can also reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and may have mild or no symptoms in the early stages.
Therefore, patients who are detected at an early stage or until symptoms appear can spread the virus to a greater extent during daily activities, creating a significant challenge to the control of the outbreak.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been thought to occur when patients are in critical condition, when transmission is less likely than in the early stages.
Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the current SARS and more difficult to control.
In China, efforts are currently underway to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, including lockdowns in Wuhan and Sanaa suburbs and a series of isolation measures for the entire population.
While these actions are economically disruptive, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a declining epidemic.
The most optimistic forecast was that the start would be completed by March and the level of degradation would last for 3-4 months.
However, some experts have a somewhat pessimistic view.
Paul Hunter, et al., predict that COVID-19, the most common SARS disease, will not be eradicated by 2020.
Longini, et al., proposed a model to predict the impact of the pandemic and predict that SARS-CoV-2 will infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the nasal cavities and mucous membranes of patients who had been hospitalized for two weeks, indicating that the new virus was a recurrent flu.
However, promising signs have emerged in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that strategies are now likely to be in place.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause millions of cases and half a million deaths.
However, despite some improvement, the disease is gradually coming under control.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by a virus that is either transmitted by the body or by a virus that is not transmitted by a person living with it.
A comparison of COVID-19 SARS and MERS outbreaks is presented below (Fig. (Fig. 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted in high doses by coughing or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with infected materials.
The virus has also been found in bats, which has triggered new opportunities for bite-to-mouth transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients reported 41% of them were infected with nosocomial infection, 17 patients with other diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, extreme caution should be exercised to protect oneself, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, friends, and caregivers of patients or those who come into contact with infected persons.
The first line of prevention to reduce the risk of infection is through the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and respiratory N95 masks (series # 1860s) to help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical mask pads are liquid pads that prevent the patient from moving through the air or holding the surgical instruments in place, where they can pass through other surgical pads.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect against the total viral content of up to 10 to 80 nm when inhaled, compared to 5% of the total viral content that is fully absorbed; SARS-CoV-2 has the same frequency and wavelength of approximately 85 nm.
Because the small parts of the face mask that are collected during surgery can pass through the five layers, healthcare workers who come into direct contact with the patient should wear a non-surgical N95 mask (standard # 1860s).
In addition to masks, healthcare providers should wear more anti-virus masks, which are more costly than long-term flu masks.
The virus can also infect humans through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor wearing an N95 mask was also diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2, possibly through a blood transfusion into his body.
Therefore, healthcare workers should wear eye and face masks when working with patients.
For the general public in areas of high pressure or extreme pressure, it is strongly recommended that everyone wash their hands with antibacterial soap more often than usual, try to remain in private isolation and limit contact with people who are severely affected.
The three-fold is considered to be the right way for people to get rid of patients.
This technique is also useful in reducing disease and preventing the spread of the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that has spread to the human world, and a January 7, 2020 report that the SARS-CoV is similar to the more advanced SARS of 2003 has raised serious concerns in China.
However, as of 19th May 2020, the head of Wuhan Centres for Disease Control has not been encouraging the public by telling them that the new virus has a low morbidity and limited human-to-human transmission, which is not a problem to prevent and control.
The message has dramatically dampened public alert, especially as the entire country prepares for the Spring Festival and the crucial time has passed with the disease being reduced to a minor level in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies deserve to learn from this powerful lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more cautious when issuing public notices that any word is valuable to the citizen and can change their minds and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and provide advice to clinics that are not informed by the official reports from doctors or regulators; (3) be more limited to targeting the public at an early stage rather than encouraging it; and (4) provide more often targeted and effective means of providing public awareness of the epidemic and improve the public's screening and response systems over time.
The COVID-19 outbreak was caused by SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019.
In less than two months, the entire period covered by this article was distributed in China and nearly 50 other countries.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the onset of COVID-19 has created a sense of resumption of SARS.
However, there are clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial to stopping the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 has more young people than older people, more women than men, and more young deaths than older people.
SARS-19 has a higher risk of death than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 can also transmit when they are not expected to show symptoms and SARS can transmit when they are severely ill, making it difficult to prevent COVID-19 from SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading so rapidly and widely.
The RNA sequence for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
In other words, patients who recover from the virus may be re-positive.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Based on the rapidly developing COVID-19 tests, several critical issues still need to be addressed, such as:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% homologous strains have been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs in bats, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal strain transmits the virus from the original host, the night-bird, to humans?
Unknown to answer #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the spread, and the outbreak may return at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical sequences show binding to SARS-CoV-2 ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells to cause subsequent pathogenic mutations?
Does the virus bind to other cells in other organs that express ACE2?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot quickly produce meaningful research and negotiations.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus slowly multiply when it spreads from person to person?
Will it be a global pandemic, dying like SARS or a recurrence like the flu?
It is very interesting, but it may take a little time to find answers to many more questions.
However, whatever the costs, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and get our lives back to normal.
The zoonotic origin of the human corona virus
The evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host has been undergoing thousands of years, including human mutation and adaptation.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild infections.
The SARS and MERS pandemics have been launched to shed light on the seriousness and life-threatening nature of HCoV infections.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, which originated in central China in late 2019, has been the subject of intense attention due to the rapid spread of CoVs. However, compared to its sister SARS-CoV, its disease-causing potential is low.
The HCoV infection is a common cause of infection and the origin of disease between humans and animals can help us to better understand the nature of HCoVs.
Most HCoVs originate from night owls and are not transmissible.
A few HCoVs are also known to be pathogenic.
Animal identification is a direct process in human disease prevention.
Studies of the association of CoVs to animals and CoV pathogenesis to humans may be found.
In this section, we briefly describe the knowledge about the seven HCoVs, their history of detection and their transmission.
More specifically, we have identified different HCoVs from the perspective of viral evolution and genetic modification.
He discussed the spread of the 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19).
In addition, key elements of successful vaccination and understanding the strength of the virus' transmission in the disease were also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family of coronaviruses that include the covert, covert, and positively sensitive RNA groups.
These viruses are the largest genes of 26 to 32 RNA clones, called CoVs, because of their crown-like electron signaling morphology.
CoVs, in turn, have a non-differentiated whole gene that shares a common structure.
Approximately two-thirds of the open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) of the gene have two cross sections, which are translated into replicates of the proteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are designed to synthesize 16 protein alters, the nsp1~16 instructions.
The remaining ORFs contain structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of specific strains of proteins were also isolated from the strains of other CoVs.
Based on the different protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), of which beta-CoVs contain HCoVs, and are further classified into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Phenogenetic evidence has shown that bats and bats serve as the genetic source of many alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major transmitters of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have continuously crossed the species boundaries and some have been found as human pathogens.
To date, seven human (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63n alpha-CoVs.
Five other beta-CoVs, including HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1, are associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East with acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
As is known, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 cause mild symptoms, such as colds and/or heartburn.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly transmissible to other organisms, causing a reduced respiratory system in many patients and developing ARDS and pneumonia.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was identified in the 1960s by studying the pathogen.
Since then, data has been accumulated from the analysis of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which show distinct symptoms.
Indeed, the idea that HCoVs are harmless to humans was widely accepted until the advent of SARS.
The 2003 SARS outbreak, with 8,000 deaths and 10% deaths, was one of the worst in recent history.
A decade later, the MERS outbreak has spread rapidly to the Arabian Peninsula and other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), sequentially named SARS-CoV-2, is the most recent outbreak of the coronavirus caused by the 2019 pandemic (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020, has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000.
The world is already waking up and preparing for the onslaught of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
HCoVs have a weekly history of animal-to-human transmission from bats, rodents or domestic animals.
There is ample supporting evidence that HCoVs originated in night owls, and the virus is not adaptive and non-transmissive, but is highly differentiated.
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on health, science, society and the psyche in China and around the world.
Tracking the transmission of novel HCoVs lays the foundation for understanding the human genome, the driving force and the prevention of the spread of the species.
This will allow for the desirability, moderation and robustness of the host animal for SARS-CoV-2, and is critical in preventing future transmission.
In this response, we look at animal-to-human diseases, their genetic characteristics, their transmission and the disease-causing capacity of HCoVs.
In addition, we have reviewed the possibility that the HCoVs family of viruses, which do not cause disease in their native habitat, can cause disease when they are transferred to other species.
We will also investigate new evidence of a slow HCoV mutation that reduces the transmission of the disease source and increases its transmission.
The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has also been discussed in this content.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930s.
The HCoV-229E strain B814 virus was previously identified in infected animals, including Turkey, in infected sheep, cattle, pigs, goats and dogs.
In the last decade, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The HCoV history (summary 1) is presented in a clear and concise manner in a straightforward and informative format.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in 1966, and later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have similar cold symptoms, including coughing, coughing, allergic reactions, and 10~20% coughing.
Since 1967, HCoV-OC43 has been isolated from body deposits in a controlled form in mature brain tissue.
The clinical sequence of HCoV-OC43 infections is similar to those of HCoV-229E, which cannot be transmitted by respiratory tract symptoms to other known infections of influenza viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally transmissible, and are also transmitted in the winter in temperate climates.
Overall, the duration of the two viruses is less than one week, with an estimated duration of 2 months following the onset of pain.
According to a study of survivors, people infected with HCoV-229E show mild symptoms of seizures.
A few patients with mild anaemia have been found to have elevated respiratory system impairment.
SARS, also known as non-communicable pneumonia, was the first known HCoV infectious disease in human history and the origin of SARS-CoV, the third HCoV, was discovered.
The first case of SARS was detected in China's Guangdong Province in late 2002.
The SARS outbreak has reportedly killed 8 people, with 096 deaths and 774 deaths.It is spreading from country to country and continent to continent.
Unlike the most commonly transmitted, any estimated cases are likely to rise to two cases, with a day-on-day peak of 4 to 7 and a day-on-day peak of 10 cases.
Patients with SARS-CoV infection are at first experiencing muscle pain, headache, fever, nausea and cold... coughing and respiratory distress are recent symptoms.
SARS laboratory symptoms: decreased blood cell count, decreased liver function, and increased blood levels of keratin and kaolin (pyridine).
The effects of alveolar diffusion, appetite and increased macrophage are also evident in SARS infections.
An estimated 20-30% of patients require intensive care and are in need of assisted respiratory systems.
In addition to the respiratory tract, multiple organ transplants, liver and kidney can also be detected in severe cases, as is known by the strong atmospheric effects of cytokines, which can kill the patients' resistance.
The virus was first transmitted through a respiratory pneumonia from Guanzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, major steps have been taken for HCoV testing.
HCoV-NL63 was discovered in the Netherlands in 2004 in a 7-year-old child.
It was initially found to be more prevalent in infants, the elderly, and people with mild respiratory distress.
The manifestations of choriosis, conjunctivitis, dyspnea and pneumonia are similar in HCoV-NL63 infection.
Another independent study in the Netherlands has identified similar viruses from the nasal mucus of an 8-year-old boy with pneumonia.
It originated in the Netherlands and has spread around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 causes 4.7% of respiratory diseases.It is most prevalent during late summer, autumn and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also known as laryngitis-associated deformity, croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was detected in a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized in Hong Kong with pneumonia and bronchitis.
In the population-specific context of pneumonia and bronchitis, HCoV-HKU1 is also reported to be the most severe case.
As with HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is found worldwide, causing respiratory illness.
The four human-to-human HCoVs have adapted to the virus and the overall frequency of transmission appears to be low, although the infections, like HCoV-NL63, are of unknown origin, and recently respiratory tract infections have been reported in China.
In general, if HCoVs are found to have adequate transmission capabilities and are constantly in contact with humans, their toxicity or pathogenicity is reduced.
MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in a 60-year-old man with pneumonia and pneumonia.
While several laboratories have confirmed that the virus originated in the Middle East, outbreaks have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
The second outbreak began in South Korea in 2015 and claimed 186 lives.
The clinical manifestation is similar to MERS SARS, with progressive exacerbation of pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients also have severe bowel disease, which makes MERS very different from HCoV.
30% of patients show symptoms of spinal and abdominal pain, such as diarrhea and heartburn.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratories have confirmed 34.4% of the reported serious cases, making MERS-CoV one of the most serious viruses of concern.
In early to mid-2019, a group of pneumonia patients identified contact with SARS-CoV-2 patients in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has reported that the lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been designated as an international health emergency by the World Health Organization as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 3.4% of the 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide had died.
In particular, Hubei recorded a mortality rate of 4.2 percent in China, and 1.2 percent abroad.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are characterized by body fever, cough and shortness of breath.
A few patients have also had a heart transplant.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious diseases that can quickly cause a person to lose his or her immune system.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar, they are classified into different branches within the phylogenetic tree due to the 82% similarity of the nucleotides.
SARS-CoV-2 is not contagious but is more contagious compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It has been reported that the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 can spread rapidly around the world.
It is important to compare SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs against six other variants and to understand their differences.
First, the prevalence and incidence of HCoVs are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows six other common traits of HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the COVID-19 SARS-CoV and four community-sponsored HCoVs (such as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) is found.
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by mild symptoms that are common in human-to-human HCoVs, including non-identifiable expression.
On the other hand, even in low-level cases, small groups can also be infected with the deadly COVID-19 virus SARS-CoV.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from person to person is dependent on the characteristics of HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 is now at least as high as that of HCoVs from one strain to another.
On the other hand, if transmission of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV decreases, the reality remains in a cleaner form.
Finally, like HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 also finds its way into the monkey population.
The role of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is largely due to oral transmission, and the prevalence of SARS-CoV is yet to be determined.
It is interesting to see whether SARS-CoV-2 is seasonal as well as HCoVs are seasonal.
However, the extent of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, its origin and delay in transmission may affect the final chance of COVID-19 spreading to humans.
All four human-to-human HCoVs have been shown to be highly adaptive to human-to-human transmission of mild symptoms.
On the other hand, it may be true that humans are well adapted to HCoVs.
In other words, their mice may be resistant to the previous HCoV infection.
HCoVs are known to cause severe disease in humans and have been eliminated in people with high levels of HCoV infection.
To achieve this, HCoVs must replace the lattice-bounded blockage of the human host.
In this sense, the spread and spread of SARS-CoV-2 can be a complete human adaptation.
If it is spread sufficiently, it is likely to be difficult to control transmission through quarantine or measurement.
For years, four infectious CoVs have been circulating in the community, and similar activity is worthy of a boost in the immune system.
These viruses do not need to accumulate in animal feces.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not adapted to human health with high transmissibility, and transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They are responsible for the transmission of disease from animals to humans in their colonies and the possibility of fluidity exceeds human capacity, the ability of a single organism or the capacity of a medium-sized organism.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four human-to-human HCoVs.
It is highly contagious, at least since the beginning, as are HCoVs.
However, oral HCoVs are more pathogenic and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still being studied whether it is fully adapted to humans and whether it is able to move around with humans outside the animal kingdom.
Before discussing the animal species that cause HCoVs, it is useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics, nature, origin, mediation and propagation of HCoVs.
When an animal is exposed to a body of water, the strong binding of a nucleotide-level protein serves as a carrier for the HCoV in the process.
The virus is an ancient strain of the virus.
In addition, the storage of HCoVs is continuous and long-term.
In infectious diseases, bats are naturally infected and naturally carry HCoVs or viruses.
In contrast, new HCoVs may be produced in a medium-sized host before or near human introduction, and new host adaptations may not be conducted, and transmission may occur.
This fast-receptor serves as a source of human disease and plays a strong role in allowing the virus to multiply and spread to humans.
If HCoVs do not contain the transmission of its central vector, it can become a deadly disease.
In contrast, HCoVs also adapt to the central environment and can cause long-term infections.
In this, the central guest comes to the mother's guest room.
Epidemiological studies have revealed that SARS patients are in contact with animals killed in wildlife.
Research protocols show that animal-based anti-SARS-CoV IgG commercialization has a higher prevalence compared to the general population.
The SARS-CoV virus was first identified in bee markets by civets (especially larvae) and dogs, which are similar to SARS-CoV.
This was supported by the allegedly unreported extra justice after SARS killed all the strains in the market.
However, the animal vaccine that was not reported was negative for SARS-CoV, and it is said that the vaccine is a temporary replacement for SARS-CoV and not a natural cure.
It is well known that if 80% of the animal species in Guangzhou market are capable of reproduction, the possibility of the emergence of the younger breeding stock as an additional intermediate carrier for SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of this indicates that it is the last strain of SARS-CoV.
The next animal-specific study for the SARS-CoV virus revealed that the CoV was a bat, the rhinoplasty of the CoV HKU3 bat (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) was introduced to SARS, which is found in Chinese horseshoes.
These bats are positive for the SARS-CoV antibody and the SARS-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
These and other nightingale CoVs share 88-92% of the nucleotide kin with SARS-CoV.
These studies have established that night owls carry pathogens that can cause disease in humans.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats, but with the exception of one WIV1 strain, they are identified as existing viruses.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a receptor for SARS-CoV known in humans.
WIV1 uses the facial tissue of night owls to produce cells that are made from night owls, sweat, and ACE2 in humans.
In the most extreme, immunization can prevent SARS, WIV1 infection in patients.
In this case, WIV1 is the primary SARS-CoV replacement in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence.
Although the relationship between the two viruses is high, it is generally believed that WIV1 is a SARS-CoV strain-carrier virus family and that nightingales are not a SARS-CoV strain-carrier virus.
The MERS-CoV gene sequence is similar in group to that of the nightbird CoV-HKU4 and the nightbird CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV receptors use the same host, the dipeptide peptide 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-derived RNA polymerization of MERS-CoV was detected in the body of nocturnal birds in sequence from beta-CoVs in Europe and Africa.
Currently, MERS-CoV has not been detected in night owls.
MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25 from bats are highly similar, sharing 87% of the same nucleotide.
In this case, night owls are not a rapid carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East shows that camels are not as susceptible to MERS-CoV as eastern camels in the Middle East, which is the case in many African countries.
MERS-CoV is a virus that is found in humans in camel nose wax, which has been shown to help camels carry MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV infection in camels has been detected with generally mild but severe viral outbreaks.
Typically, camels infected with measles transmit the virus not only through the digestive system, but also through the mouth, which is the main route of transmission from night owls.
However, the question now is whether the majority of confirmed cases of the virus are not from contact with camels.Many are believed to have been transmitted from humans to humans, while others live in other species of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV RaTG13, which is isolated from the nucleus of the rhinoplasty of night-fly.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections, the classified differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very good for classifying family relationships.
This suggests that the nightingale may not be the immediate carrier of SARS-CoV-2, and that similar nightingale CoVs may be discovered in the future.
It is estimated that the animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are among the species of wild animals sold and slaughtered in the Hunan food market, which is linked to many of the primary causes of COVID-19, possibly animal-to-human transmission.
Recent metagenomic studies have suggested a group of parasitic animals called Pangolis (Manis javanica) beta-CoVs SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolins share the gene sequence of the 85-92% nucleotide cofactor of CoV with the SARS-CoV-2 wall.
However, they bind to RTG13 at approximately 90% of the total nucleotide level.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2 strains such as phylogenetic tree viruses, the receptor-like growth factor (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 is associated with a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more prevalent, despite a higher degree of sequence similarity across genes.
A previous study on infected pangolins confirmed the presence of a pneumonia specimen, which is similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used techniques and guidelines to generate a gene sequence and contained 86.3% of the total virus gene.
We can confirm that pangolins may be carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, at this time, there is no direct evidence for the location of SARS-CoV-2, due to the work on identifying SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin-like CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin beta-CoVs.
The transmission pathway of SARS-CoV-2 remains stalled in night owls, pangolins and other mammals.
RBDs are found in the middle layer between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, and beta-CoVs are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, with SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 sharing a continuous layer in the overall gene.
A high degree of RBD pangolin selection is associated with the mutation process of SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2s.
The team conducted a new analysis of the SARS-CoV-2-garabeta-CoV and RaTG13 pangolin in three animal species.
As a driving force behind the evolution, the new strain of MERS-CoV is spreading.
Salgene is still found in the immediate SARS-CoV-2 outbreak zone.
In addition, pathogenic strains such as HCoVs, which are transmitted from animals to humans, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 should also be tested.
According to phylogenetic evidence, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E CoVs may originate from night owls, when the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 virus families are found in the bite.
CoV tu was reportedly named ARCoV.2.The Appalachian CoV is found in the mountains of North America.It has a strong relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is associated with other CoV strains, including Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana and is expected to be introduced by intermediate host camels.
For purity, the HCoVs now known to be of animal origin are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
Phylogenetic analysis of strains of HCoVs has provided evidence for historical transmission.
In 1890, when HCoV-OC43 was transmitted from animals to species for human infection, a respiratory infection was recorded.
The transmission history of the HCoV-229E strain is unclear.
Alpha-CoVs found in night owls have been identified as having a similarity to HCoV-229E.
Among them is alpha-CoV2 alpaca.
There is considerable evidence that the virus is transmitted directly from bats to humans.
First, the alpacas, not the human, were contacted by night owls.
There, people are close to the alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-nCoVs are not transmitted in bats and other alpha-CoVs, whereas alpaca alpha-CoVs cause respiratory infections in bats.
In conclusion, alpha-CoV alpaca has not been detected in domestic animals.
In this case, the possibility of alpaca transmission to HCoV-229E-alpha-CoV in humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, night owls are the direct source of animal viruses, such as Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that night owls can transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
The next option is to use alpacas and camels as intermediate carriers of the virus to humans, specifically in MERS-CoV infection, while night owls serve as carriers of the HCoV-229E gene.
MERS-CoV variants serve as a model for transmission from night-bird to camel and from sea to human.
The origin of MERS-CoV from night owls is known by the identity of the pathogen, and has been confirmed by a series of findings.
The nightingale species are thought to be responsible for the spread and transmission of the mutated virus.
Longevity, organized colonies, social interaction and strong flight abilities are the conditions that allow night owls to transmit the virus.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been detected in camels for the past decade.
The male is the central host in camels and lives in the natural host.
MERS-CoV is a deadly disease and causes low reproductive performance in other animals.
This is a transient human-to-human transmission, and MERS-CoVs cannot continue to be transmissible.
Compared to Gala's role in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of Panglon, if any, is different in SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoVs are the primary cause of pangolin infection.
These beta-CoVs are related to the SARS-CoV-2 strain, which is likely to be the last strain, and are similar in nature to the SARS-CoV viruses.
The way in which SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted from organisms to humans is yet to be studied in the future.
First, the night-fly should be a close relative of SARS-CoV-2, which is more closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings can share a nest with night owls by biting and excrete.
Second, pangolins are the primary site of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
People can also contract the virus through the sale and consumption of meat.
Many mammals, including endemic animals, may be suspected of SARS-CoV-2.
The efficacy of domestic and wild animal studies was confirmed.
Third, as listed above, the identification and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 in the third strain may occur in those with co-infection with night owls and pangolins.
Animal testing for SARS-CoV-2 is still underway.
In addition to animals, there are three virological influences to facilitate the passage of CoVs between different animal species.
First of all, their RNA latitude is a reference to the location of the binding site.
In comparison to single-chain RNA viruses, the estimated prevalence of CoVs ranges from medium to large with a replacement rate of ~10-4 per 2-year cycle, based on the adaptation of new CoVs.
CoVs have exoribonucleases, which are highly modifiable and reduced in their effectiveness.
Remdesivir is also known to inhibit the synthesis of CoVs by inhibiting exoribonuclease and RNA polymerization of RNA.
Remdesivir is one of the promising SARS-CoV-2 replacement agents in clinical trials.
In fact, the rate of CoVs mutation is a million times greater than that of the covers.
In addition, the amount of latency is higher when the CoVs do not fit properly to the carrier.
Compared to the dominant variant of SARS-CoV, the variant of SARS-CoV-2 is low, indicating a high degree of genetic adaptation.
It is likely that he has adapted to another home that is more accessible to people.
It is also effective against SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV, which was developed in western and northern African mosquitoes.
In theory, the genetic interpretation of the administration of vaccines and antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely and has no immediate benefit.
Second, the large RNA gene will enable the differentiation of the lattice and the stability of the large plastic gene in CoVs, thus increasing the chances of the creation of a hybrid strain, which will be useful for the development of new CoVs when appropriate.
This is supported by several unique factors, including the open reading frame and the protein sequence at the 3 end of the gene.
Third, CoVs mutate periodically or continuously as RNA is converted.
In the bacterium that serves as a blood vessel, a key chain is formed repeatedly on the CoV RNA.
Long-term relative and RNA synthesis can lead to new CoVs.
Evidence of a natural phylogenetic combination of HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 has been found in animal CoVs such as the SL-CoV of the nightingale and the batCoV-HKU9.
The interaction of the Battu and the virus is linked to its spread.
Apart from the above three viral effects, the host's interaction with the virus can cause the virus to spread between different species.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV hybrid was taken as a specimen, which showed positive selection of the transmitted strain.
Comparative analysis based on human and mouse evolution of SARS-CoVs, suggests that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different populations, especially with RBD mutations of protein S.
In general, RBD is a protein that is isolated from the host by the receptor and the receptor of the host in the CoV.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is between the 318th and 510th amino acid in the S1 subunit, which binds to human ACE2 and is the central entry point of the virus.
The RBD of SARS-CoV allows the ACE2 receptor to detect the transmission of the virus between different species in different animals, such as bats, seagulls and dogs.
In fact, only 6 amino acids have been studied in humans and 4 of the RBDs are co-forming ACE2 receptor chains.
SARS-CoV virus with mutations of RBD K479N and S487T attracts human spike proteins and ACE2.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can transmit the virus to humans.
It is not predicted that SARS-CoV-2 will share the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
The association of the S1 protein with human ACE2 variation may be modified by a 30% difference between the S1 unit of protein S and SARS-CoV-2 mutations.
Cryo-EM studies suggest that there is a high binding affinity between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoVs protein of 10 to 20 times.
It is important to note that additional co-transmitters may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but is a separate S-type.
There are several HCoV receptors, such as the aminopeptide N HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-acetylethyl sialic acid HCoV-OC43.
CoVs can adapt to humans after they are transmitted from animals to humans through their larvae.
In addition to the cell-based receptor, the mode of transmission of HCoVs is governed by the acute nature of the virus.
The difference in human protein homelands and natural homelands of HCoVs such as night owls, camels and reptiles may limit the spread of the virus to a wider variety of species.
The HCoV virus breaks the host's boundary and attaches to the host, then fights and begins to transmit.
In this context, molecular determinants of the viral pathogen regions are identified and classified.
The large-scale gene-purification of the cell may be successful due to the expected standard of CRISPR technology.
Emergency detection of new HCoVs; returns to soil only
The variation of bats and CoVs has allowed the discovery of the new HCoVs virus.
In this sense, CoVs help to identify nightingales as the genus of HCoVs.
In addition, the rapid spread and the genetic determination of HCoVs also serve as two important sequences in the evolution and evolution of the virus.
For example, their search for or missing gene-naming proteins has the potential to improve the robustness of viral phenotypes.
Of the SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 was the most common strain of the nightbird virus, but the protein found in ORF8 is different from that found in the nightbird SARS-CoV.
The 29 SARS-CoVs nucleotide-destroying trait, a diagnostic test for the first human outbreak, was discovered.
This process separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to initiate the process of gene mutation.
In contrast, SARS-CoVs have a history of genetic linkage between alpha- and gamma-CoVs, which is characterized by a significant disruption between RNA-compound and RNA polymers.
The new classification area has been identified in nsp9, nsp10 mass and nsp14 bodies.
Studies in the wild in Saudi Arabia have shown that the MERS-CoV virus can reproduce in its own host.
MERS-CoV has been identified in SARS-CoVs as a self-constructing property of HCoVs. HCoVs are inherited in other animals with no genetic diversity.
Caution should be exercised as artificial selection can cause unexpected changes in the virus genome, many of which reduce the effects of viral infections, such as immune deficiencies.
An example of a full-length sequence of ORF4 genes in HCoV-229E is a chain of prototypes, divided into two nucleotide chains.
When ORF4 is not affected, the HCoV-229E eulatin virus in bats and camels binds, alpaca alpha-CoV indicating that the insertion of a single nucleotide alters the entrainment.
Ultimately, however, the slow progression of new HCoVs is also driven by the influence of public choice.
Only mild signs or symptoms were detected when the night owls were infected with CoVs, which led to a mismatch between CoVs and night owls.
It has been found that night owls have been infected with CoVs on their bodies and in their intestines.
For example, a lack of vaccination reduces the antibody response of night owls to tests for CoVs.
In the wild, the natural actions of nightbird killer cells were disrupted by the NKG2/CD94 mutant killer cell and the I section of the molecular membrane.
Furthermore, high levels of ROS can inhibit the high metabolic activity of CoV in bats, in which case selection of the high transmission virus effect in newly discovered bats is the lead.
The pathogenic co-infectants of the virus build themselves up, thus interacting with the new carrier protein of the organism.
In this context, the three new HCoVs that have emerged over the past two centuries are not coincidental.
CoVs are not transmitted by humans and are a common symptom of carriers such as bats and camels.
They can breed in a strong nest without the protection of a host.
The mystery of the patient is what the symptoms are and what the genetic disease is.
Severe symptoms are characterized by hyperactivity of the immune system and cytokines, which are characterized by severe immunity, and severe pneumonia.
In contrast, passengers without symptoms were isolated from the CoV by a response to immunity.
A similar variant that tries to detect immunity may be effective for SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response of night-flying birds varies greatly.
Therefore, the first-line interface should be used at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation is a disorder in night owls.
For these reasons, the NLRP3 MCC950 inhibitor may be useful for the treatment of COVID-19.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a general consensus on the prevalence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The beta-CoV of the bat shares 95% of the nucleotide with SARS-CoV, and the bat shares 96% of the homologous nucleotide with SARS-CoV-2.
Birds and other animals on the market are susceptible to many viruses, such as SARS-CoV. The direct carrier SARS-CoV-2 is undetectable.
Pangolin beta-CoVs are a distinct strain of SARS-CoV-2 that may serve as intermediate carriers or cause pangolin beta-CoVs to evolve into the final SARS-CoV-2 gene fragment.
Although there are questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is a deliberate or deliberate human-caused disease.
CoVs have returned to the surface to attract the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Studies of CoVs in night owls and other animals have changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic and animal-derived transmission of HCoVs to humans.
Research shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from night owls, and are transmitted to humans through the larval stage.
The spread of SARS-CoV in the marketplace is linked to the spread of human-animal contagion, which is known as civet and the closure of the marketplace and killing of the animal will stop the spread of SARS.
For similar reasons, pangolin should be withdrawn from the market due to the prevention of animal-to-human transmission, given the presence of pangolin strains that are similar to beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans via pangolins and other rodents is yet to be determined by future studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long been present in the Western Sahara and North Africa.
They were an important means of transportation, and they were used to produce meat, milk, leather, and clothing.
The Balkans are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control as in wildlife testing in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the current MERS outbreak, a reliable vaccine to prevent MERS-CoV along with other disease control measures should be developed.
Since the virus cannot be eradicated completely, new genotypes may be discovered.
Various zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the wild.
There are variations in the number of CoVs from bats and those from animals to humans.
There are many ways in which CoVs can spread and interact, and the emergence of new CoVs that are highly contagious and deadly is being monitored.
The Chinese tradition of eating wild animals in some areas should be banned to reduce the conflict between humans and animals.
Preparations and responses to the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 outbreaks are underway.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They stay in their natural clutches until the opportunity arises.
Although night owls have many signs of transmitting the virus, the way in which humans can spread the virus to night owls and other wildlife is by learning about the ways in which humans avoid them.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is useful to study the natural habitat of CoVs, which can be useful to identify and control the possible future spread of disease between animals and humans.
To prevent the spread of the virus, the most effective way to transmit it to humans is to avoid the presence of a host of viruses.
Several SARS-CoV-2 strains are still being eradicated.
First, it is useful to see under what circumstances the nightingale and the pangolin share a habitat if the SARS-CoV-2 virus is transmitted by nightingales to pangolins.
Second, if the nightingale is a major transmitter, how do humans interact with the nightingale?
Third, if the mammals serve as a central drinking hub, then the night owls, or pangolins, must be able to distinguish how they interact with other species, including humans.
At the same time, surveillance and testing should be carried out if SARS-CoV-2 is found in ruminants, including bees.
It is expected to be a natural precursor to the viruses of other species, including bats, pangolins or other hosts, SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses of the isolated families.
Continued research in this area provides important data on the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, and the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to improve the criteria for testing for COVID-19 symptoms in suspected and confirmed cases.
On February 6, 2020, our team presented a proposal for a 2019 research and treatment guideline for the new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pandemic, which is a good idea to share our experience and ensure global control of the pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge is gradually improving based on ongoing research findings and patient experience; therefore, methods for diagnosing and treating symptoms are continually being improved.
In this letter, we have submitted a new screening criteria for suspected and confirmed cases in response to a comment on our guidelines, as per the most recent (seventh edition) COVID-19 screening and response guidelines released by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
The new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially named the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its variant branded as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), began in December 2019.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
Our team has issued emergency advisory guidelines for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which were published online in the Military Medical Journal on February 6, 2020.
Since its publication, it has captured the attention of many.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our understanding and knowledge is slowly evolving based on the findings of ongoing research and patient experience; therefore, methods for diagnosing and identifying symptoms are continually improving.
For example, the Guidelines for the Symptoms and Symptoms of Concomitant Treatment for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, has issued seven general editions, some of which have been substantially modified.
We are currently receiving feedback from Zhou et al. for our guidance, who based their experience with patients on a simple note-taking approach.
Their work added new evidence to our guidance and was a valuable witness to the global pandemic.
We recognize and appreciate their valuable work.
However, their work also requires new research and treatments in connection with the pioneering COVID-19 (seventh-generation) vaccine.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), one of the characteristics of the medical history to confirm the presence of a suspected patient is to combine two of the symptoms of the patient and make a general classification, or if the patient does not have a clear medical history, he or she must complete three of the symptoms.
Preliminary infection and control history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan and its environs or other communities with COVID-19 infection reported 14 days prior without symptoms; (2) contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of patients with burns or respiratory symptoms, who came from Wuhan and its environs, or other communities who had been removed from COVID-19 infection reported 14 days prior without symptoms; (4) history of confirmed infection (in patients with 2 or more cases and 2 or more cases of respiratory symptoms in the study, such as contact with a hospital, a clinic, or a hospital)
Clinical signs: (1) physical activity and/or symptoms; (2) imaging with COVID-19; (3) normal red blood cell count, or decreased lymphocyte count at the initial detection stage.
Diagnosis of confirmed patients should be based on the following criteria: (1) a PCR test showing positive SARS-CoV-2 at the time; (2) if the total viral load of the new coronavirus is highly similar; (3) if the IgM antibody is positive for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody; or if the specific antibody to SARS-CoV-2 has changed from negative to positive, or if the antibody in the recovery phase is higher than the current level of the disease and more than 4 times higher than the IgG.
We can see the addition of the PCR test, which tests for the presence of nucleic acid in the airways or bloodstream during the test period, in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The blood samples are taken to detect microorganisms that can cause disease; the fourth (June 27-2020), fifth (August 8-2020) samples are taken, and the blood samples are taken on the seventh day.
These improvements based on the ongoing work of researchers have increased the availability of various samples, including selective nucleic acid detection devices for rapid symptomatic testing, and respiratory sampling of blood vessels, and have supported the introduction of positive results in specific blood vessels to the established standard.
In addition, there has been a rapid increase in the number of reminders to avoid patients with both symptoms and non-symptoms.
Therefore, the risk of infection by Zout et al. should be improved, as they have identified a person without symptoms as having a lower risk of infection.
The method of grading should also be confirmed by further clinical and research work.
The bottom line is that we hope that the evidence will come to light for all readers to comment.
We recommend that they search for and follow the most recent guidelines in their country for the diagnosis of suspected and confirmed cases.
Our team will update our guidelines periodically to help you.

On Sunday, in a video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road and Bridge Transportation Obaidul Quader said public transportation would remain closed longer than originally planned, until next Sunday.
The suspension of public transport operations is scheduled to begin on March 26 and end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential materials, fuel and food was still allowed.
The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy and one of their parents.
On March 19, all three men were in remission.
Worldwide, the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases has exceeded one million.
According to Johns Hopkins University, the total number of people infected with SARS-Cov-2 worldwide has passed one million on Thursday.
At least 52 thousand deaths from COVID-19, caused by the coronavirus, have been linked.
The same day was a landmark day for the first case of coronavirus in Malawi and the first death from coronavirus in Zambia.

Australian stores pushed the boundaries of toilet soap in human interaction.
On Sunday and Saturday nights, Australian department stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase limits from toilet paper to two and one penny per bill and income in all international department stores.
ALDNIN started the day with a thief.
The attacks were spread through messages at checkouts and links on Facebook pages.
Customers reportedly have storage facilities for self-isolation due to fears of COVID-19
On Wednesday, Woolworths placed a toilet paper card in a corner of the supply shed.
The changes follow the previous four packages of single-use bans from Woolworths and Coles, which were launched on March 4 and 5 respectively.
According to a press release from Kohl's on March 8, the number of items sold within an hour, along with the number of items being stolen, is expected to be high, the Aldi newspaper said on Tuesday.
Sales have surged by 10 points in the past week, according to a statement from Walworth.
Costa Rica's council has limited the number of robberies in Canberra to two last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered stores from major suppliers and increased frequency of deliveries, while Woolworths ordered more stocks and made stocks in advance of the planned Special Spring season.
Australian Labor Union chief executive Russell Zimmerman says workers are trying to fill their positions, but restrictions on local councils have made it difficult to install machines.
He expects higher production prices, as suppliers try to meet demand, and the exceptional is small.
On the day of the planting, following the previous release of ADLI stocks, a few stores were unable to run the special Rainy Day.
According to a report on News.com.au, staffing expert at the Queensland University of Technology says the warehouses are filled with supplies every night.
The sofa suggested that the bathroom was a large piece of furniture, leading to a reduction in the number of stalls and, when sold, leaving only large chairs, reinforcing the fear of loss.
According to ABC News, "Coles and Woolworths suggest that if more items were on your desk, and if things like toilet cleaners and sanitizers were affordable and available in abundance, you could reduce social gatherings", said Russell Zimmerman.
The toilet chef's production said that he was out of touch with the news last Wednesday.
Kimberly-Clarke, who created the Cleanex toilet soap, and Solar Paper, who created Smoke, said they are also working 24/7 as a provider of watches, according to news.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reports that some providers are offering free toilet software to Melbourne street buyers.
The NT column, published in the Darwin Daily on Thursday, included eight pages of paper that had been torn down and used as toilet paper.
Kulesley initially refused to accept restrictions, saying he had no plans to impose restrictions on sales, according to a BBC Australia report on 3 March.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are in high demand, including handbags, sanitary towels, dry clothes, hand washing, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, the sale of Andrew's bathroom soap at the British Okado Centre on Sunday evening was around 12 to 2.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19  caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus  as a global pandemic.
While the term pandemic broadly refers to the spread of disease, it does not specify the severity of specific cases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has called for government action:
All countries can still change the course of the epidemic.
"When countries in response identify, test, identify, isolate, report and classify their people", said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about the rate of spread and severity of the virus and the level of operational warning.
According to Dr. Tom Fredy, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the outbreak is "unprecedented".
In a February CNN note, he said that apart from influenza, no respiratory virus has progressed from sudden to sustained global spread.
Ghebreyesus also expressed similar views he had not seen the spread of the coronavirus pandemic before.
Furthermore, we have never seen a global pandemic controlled at the same time.
The new situation is the one that has been the global pandemic since the WHO declared the pandemic a global public health emergency in January.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the pandemic is a matter of "substance abuse and more".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 global coronavirus pandemic is the ongoing global pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the sudden onset of severe pneumonia caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a Global Public Health Emergency on January 30, 2020, and recognized as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 1.61 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
364,000 people have already declared their support.
The death rate from the disease in China is 4%, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.8% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include nausea, coughing, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms may include pneumonia and severe respiratory distress.
The time from exposure to symptoms is about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known cure or specific treatment.
The first step is symptomatic and therapeutic.The recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping a distance from others, and following and isolating suspected infected persons.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, improving quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and closing institutions.
The global pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic instability, postponement or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread public procurement, leading to severe supply shortages.
Schools or universities are closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting an estimated 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Fake news about the virus has been spread online and widely criticized by critics such as xenophobes and people of Chinese, East and Southeast Asian ethnicity and other races from areas where the virus is most prevalent.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of major industries, there is a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
A group of Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) authorities reported cases of unknown cause of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Many patients are associated with the Hunan Seafood market, so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic basis.
The virus that caused the outbreak, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus that is transmitted by the bats coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, and SARS-CoV.The man who was first identified with the symptom became ill on December 1, 2019, and the man had no contact with the post-mortem cluster of organisms.
Two-thirds of the clusters reported in December 2019 were found to have a silent connection.
On 13 March 2020, the South China Morning Post unofficially reported that the case, which returned on 17 November 2019, was the first in 55 years from Hubei province.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported a sharp increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, as new cases in China were reported to be declining, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.
The lower incidence of reported cases is more common, especially in those with moderate symptoms.
On 26 February, a comparison of the fewest cases reported among young people, with parents aged 19 and under representing 2.4% of cases globally, was published.England's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population should be diagnosed if physical immunity in society is not achieved.
The number of COVID-19-related cases, and those that have been confirmed positive through the legal process, is also high.
As of March 23, the country had not tested 3% of its population, and several countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland have policies that do not test immigrants with mild symptoms.
A report published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 diagnoses were undetectable, and that the diagnosis was not supported by documented evidence, which was the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 estimated that the number of deaths in Italy was higher than reported.
The initial estimate of the reproductive rate (R0) of COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a warning that it should be 5.7.
Many people infected with COVID-19 are dying.
For those without parents, the time from symptom recovery to death was between 6 and 41 days, with the normal range being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, only about 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
As of February 5, 80% of deaths in China were in people over 60 and 75% were from pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.According to protocol, the death toll from the global COVID-19 pandemic is the death toll of people who tested positive for COVID.
The number of deaths from COVID-19 is likely to be higher, as is the number of people who die without being tested, e.g. at home, in treatment centers, etc.
Italy's death toll is 4-5 times higher than the standard COVID death toll during the pandemic, according to unconfirmed data.
We know that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claim that the death toll is a low estimate, a statement confirmed by the complaint that identifies the lowest death toll in the U.S. as the lowest estimate ever in an outbreak, such as the 2009 swine flu H1N1 outbreak.
The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines on December 1, and the first death outside Asia was in France on December 14.
On February 28, the highest number of deaths outside of China was recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy respectively.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported deaths from all forms of malaria except Antarctica.Many measures were used to increase the incidence of malaria.
These numbers are influenced by regional and temporal variables, as well as the content of the study, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, the time since the initial onset of the disease, and demographic factors such as age, gender, and overall health.The death-to-death ratio reflects the number of cases studied between the time of the death rate breakdown.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate from the disease was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies from region to region.
In China, the estimated mortality-to-fatality ratio has dropped from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on January 1-10 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms starting on February 1 2020).Other parameters are mortality rate (CFR), which is the percentage of people tested who die from the disease, and infection rate of death (IFR), which is the percentage of people diagnosed (tested or not) with the disease.
The statistics are not time-bound and follow the disease from the patient's judgment to the population.
Many scholars have tried to estimate these numbers for a specific population.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the death rate from the disease is between 0.1% and 0.39% of the global pandemic.
The estimates of burns of this magnitude are similar to those of the first COVID-19 case study in Germany, and the Statistical Impact Assessment of CFR estimates.
WHO says the global pandemic is manageable.
The onset and the critical time of an outbreak may be unexpected and direct.
"Mac Boney of Penn State University explains, ""While not confirmed, the onset of easily transmitted diseases is characterized by a period of development after which there is little change and then a period of decline when the existing cells are exhausted".
But no reasonable estimate can be made at this time.
China's top health adviser Zhong Nanshan warned that all countries could stop the spread of the virus by June if they coordinate to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to stop the spread.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski told the London School of Hygiene and Medicine that SARS-CoV-2 would be going around for at least a year or two.
According to a study by Nell Ferguson at Imperial College, physical distancing and other measures are required for 18 months or longer before vaccination is implemented.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said he thinks the coronavirus is unlikely because it will slowly disappear from transmission and become a seasonal, ever-recurring disease.
The duration of the delay varies depending on the temperature and the medium.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be common and people who are infected should not show symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Symptoms of a stroke include fatigue, phlegm, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, pain in the wrist and elbow, sore throat, headache, cold, cough, bleeding, vomiting, or rash.The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that one in six people will suffer from severe illness and difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists the most common symptoms as shortness of breath, chest pain or stiffness, sudden dizziness, difficulty waking, and facial or joint discoloration; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended.
A few people who are diagnosed with no symptoms, who may not have clinical symptoms, but the results of the study confirm that they are diagnosed, so parents who have direct contact with confirmed cases should be monitored and evaluated more closely.
China estimates that the number of minority Muslims will be as high as 44%.
The normal duration of symptoms (between detection and onset of symptoms) is one to 14 days, more commonly five days.As an unusual example, estimates of the fraction of COVID-19 patients who lost breathing sensation initially dropped to 30% and later to 15%.
More detailed information on the spread of the disease is still being developed.
It is believed that the disease is transmitted in the early stages by close contact and small drops of saliva through coughing, sneezing and speaking; contact is 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that uncovered mosquitoes can follow a trail of 4.5 to 8.2 meters (15 to 27 feet).
Some suggest that the virus is transmitted by small droplets that form when we speak, which can remain in the air for long periods of time.Coughs can occur in the respiratory system during breathing, including when we speak, but the virus is not transmitted through the air.
These parasites can enter the mouth or nose of others, or even their lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as a tube implant to help with breathing and inducing chest palpitations, cause the lower respiratory system to become inflamed, which causes air to circulate.
It is also suitable when a person touches contaminated surfaces, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Despite the concerns that are being spread by the media, the tragedy is believed to be minor.
The Chinese government has denied transmission by mouth and mouth of SAR-CoV-2.The virus is highly transmissible within three days of onset of symptoms, but its spread is likely to persist in pre- and post-stage symptoms.
People who are tested positive three days before the onset of symptoms are advised to continue to transmit without symptoms.
Only a few laboratory reports confirmed asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission was detected in a few countries during parallel contact studies.
While it is not entirely clear how easily the virus spreads, one would generally expect two to three outbreaks, the European Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) said.The virus can live on surfaces for hours to days.
It has been found that the virus can persist on plastic (polypropylene) for up to three days, on 304 stainless steel, on cardboard for one day, and on copper for up to four hours.
This however varies depending on the species and temperature.Pets and cats have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals transmit the virus to humans, but British officials recommend washing hands after touching animals, as with other known human touch surfaces.
Coronavirus is a novel respiratory syndrome syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, first identified in three people with pneumonia and a group of patients with Wuhan's upper respiratory system who had sexual contact.
The new SARS-CoV-2 virus characteristics are found in the closely related coronavirus.Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its membrane.The original SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
It is thought to have zoonotic origins.
Genetic analysis suggests that the coronavirus is a hybrid of two species of night-bird in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (B) of the genus cluster Betacoronavirus.
The overall genome sequence is 96% identical to that of other bat coronavirus variants (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a small fraction of the gene sequence of the pangolin virus and that of humans that differed by one amino acid.
Genetic-comparison between the pangolin virus and SARS-CoV-2 was found to be 92%, which is insufficient to confirm the pathogenicity of pangolin.
A virus can be diagnosed by its symptoms, if it is confirmed by imaging reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) infected secretions or CT scan.
A comparative study of PCR and CT in Wuhan found that PCR CT responds more quickly, but many of its images are more subtle and inconsistent with the detection of pneumonia and other pathologies.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology (ACR) recommended that no screening or early detection of COVID-19 should be performed.
The World Health Organization (WHO) published the RNA test method for SARS-CoV-2 for the first time on 17 January.
The rapidly regenerating test is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) that we use.
The test may be a blood sample or a respiratory sample.
The results of the tests are usually clear in a few hours to days.
The test is generally performed on the nose, although there is a nasal swab.Several institutions and laboratories are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of the channels have been fully approved for wide use.
In the US, the serological test developed by Cellex has been confirmed to be useful only for emergency treatment in certified laboratories.
Symptoms distinguished by radiography and computed tomography (CT) include difficulty seeing and loss of pleural effusion in people with symptoms.
The Italian Radiological Society is combining an international database of Internet images for confirmed cases.
Due to the interaction with other diseases such as adenovirus, it is recommended that PCR imaging be used to detect COVID-19.
A large Chinese study found that comparative chest CT PCR and imaging were exceptionally low-resolution, and that the presentation of the results as a diagnostic tool in an epidemic environment is faster and more sensitive.
Artificial neural networks based on convolutional networks have been developed to identify the characteristics of the virus component along with radiography and CT scans.
Methods of preventing transmission include maintaining complete personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding unwashed eyes, nose and mouth, and coughing or sneezing and throwing the saliva directly into the trash.
Parents who may have the disease have been advised to wear a medical mask in public.
Measures to prevent transmission of the virus are also recommended, with many governments restricting or recommending all nonessential travel to countries and areas that are at risk of infection.
However, in many parts of the world, the virus has reached a level of social transmission.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some members of the public are not aware of how and where it is detected.Health care providers who are caring for an unidentified person are advised to use gloves, contact lenses and eye protection.Contact lenses are an effective method for health authorities to identify the source of the infection and prevent further spread.
The government's use of location data from mobile phones has raised concerns about secrecy, prompting Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations to jointly restrict such spying.
Many mobile phone users have implemented or are considering freelancing, and as of April 7, 2020, a team of more than a dozen experts were working on solutions that would allow for the sharing of personal information such as the user's travel information to other mobile phones.
Messages will be sent to users if they have been in contact with a person who has been tested positive for COVID-19.There is a widespread misunderstanding about how to prevent detection; e.g., nose-covering and toweling are not helpful.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, and many organizations are working to develop it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands repeatedly with soap and water for at least a few seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after cleaning their nose, coughing, and sneezing.
This is due to the fact that outside of the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which contaminates the cover.
The CDC has banned the use of alcohol-free hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol content when soap and free water are not available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be cleaned with several mixtures (for metal surfaces, exposure to insecticides for one minute), including 62% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate, are less effective.
If COVID is suspected or detected in service areas such as offices, daycare centers, all areas such as offices, laundry rooms, communal areas, electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATM machines used by infected persons, the CDC recommends that insect repellents be removed.
The health department recommends that people cover their mouth and nose with a towel or cloth when coughing or sneezing, and remove the cloth quickly.
Face masks are recommended during surgery for patients, while masking limits the amount and distance of travel that can prevent breathing, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has provided guidelines on when and how to use the gills.
According to Steven Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, wearing a face mask reduces the risk of contact with people who are exposed to infection if they do not wash their hands properly.
WHO recommends that healthy people only wear masks if they are at high risk, such as parents caring for someone with COVID-19, and they also recommend that masks help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends non-medical masks made of tissue.China specifically recommends medical masks that are discarded by members of the public health community, in and out of contact with other people (1 meter (3 feet or less).
Hong Kong recommends that masks be worn in operating rooms when using public transportation or in crowded areas.
Health officials in Thailand are encouraging people to wear face masks at work and to wash their face every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned people from going out in public without wearing a mask or touching their mouth and nose.
On March 16, she urged all Vietnamese to wear face masks to protect themselves and others when going out in public.
The Australian government has made it mandatory for people to wear face coverings in historic restaurants.
She required all inhabitants of Israel to wear a veil when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, required train and bus passengers to wear face masks between cities on April 1.
Panama mandates the wearing of face masks when exporting, and recommends homemade masks for those who cannot afford them.
Flowers have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a disease control practice designed to reduce the spread of disease by reducing close contact between people.
They were confined to places of worship; quarantined; restricted from traveling; and closed in schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
Individuals can adopt methods of social distancing by staying at home, avoiding travel, avoiding public areas, using quiet social gatherings, and physically distancing themselves from other parents.
Many governments are now enforcing or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of gatherings for US government officials and health agencies has been reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 outbreak in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned social gatherings of more than two people.The CDC advised that older adults and parents with health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure and a weakened immune system are at risk of severe pain and symptoms and should stay at home as much as possible in the area of the outbreak.By late March 2020, to emphasize the goal of reducing social interaction by thinking or waiting for physical contact at a distance, the WHO and other health authorities also adopted the term social distancing to represent social distancing.
The use of the term social distancing is to allow people to completely isolate themselves in some situations rather than contacting other people.Some officials are offering sexual health guidance during this pandemic.
This includes advice on having sex with a cohabitant, a non-HIV partner, or a non-symptomatic partner.
Home isolation is recommended for parents who have been tested for COVID-19 and suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have developed broad guidelines for effective self-isolation, and many governments have mandated or recommended self-isolation for all communities living in contaminated areas.
Strict evacuation instructions have been issued to those in the attack group.
Parents of individuals who have been exposed to COVID-19 and have traveled to a country or region with high prevalence are advised to self-isolate for 14 days until they are exposed.
The methods of controlling the onset of disease are prevention and prevention.
The campaign was launched at the early stages of the outbreak and to study and identify those infected and to develop other disease control measures and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to other populations.
As the spread of the virus is uncontrolled, steps are being taken to reduce the spread: measures are being taken to contain the spread and mitigate its impact on the community and health systems.
Measures to control spread and reduce harm can be taken simultaneously.
Prevention requires a more aggressive response to post-epidemic events by reducing the number of simple breeding pairs to less than 1. One form of epidemic prevention is to try to reduce the incidence of an outbreak. It is known as snake shedding.
This reduces the risk of anxiety in health services and provides more time for the development of vaccines and vaccines.
Among the foreign pharmaceutical introductions that address the epidemic are personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing a face mask, and self-isolation; public measures such as closing schools and avoiding public gatherings; encouraging acceptable public participation and participation from such influences; and environmental care such as, for example, body cleaning.Strict measures to control the epidemic have been taken in China since the severity of the epidemic was officially confirmed, including improving citywide segregation and imposing travel restrictions.
Other countries have implemented various measures designed to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has launched a round-the-clock checkpoint and a round-the-clock checkpoint and has issued a call for the detected persons to be evacuated.
Singapore has provided financial support to parents who have been identified as volunteers and imposed severe penalties on parents who do not.
Taiwan has increased its production of masks and has sanctioned its stockpiled supplies.Examples of prevention (in the process of being established but not stopped) and mitigation (reversing the spread of a specific disease) have been shown to be major challenges for Great Britain and the United States.
Improving immunity may reduce the need for health care by two-thirds and death by half, but death and anxiety still exist in thousands of health systems.
The fever may be selective, but should be contained until the virus spreads in the population (or until a vaccine is available, if it is first found), as the infection will return rapidly outside of Canada when measures are relaxed.
The long-term pressure to stop the epidemic will cause economic and social damage.
There is no approved specific antiviral for COVID-19, but efforts are underway to develop it, including trials on existing drugs.
Cough medications, liquids, and rest can alleviate the symptoms.
Severe, oxygenated, intervenous, and respiratory conditions may require assistance.
The use of steroids is a form of abuse.
Several compounds that have been proven to treat other viral diseases are being tested for survival in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also noted that some home and traditional treatments can eliminate the symptoms of SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and providing the necessary health care for COVID-19 patients is identified by WHO as a key response to the pandemic.
ECDC and the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and healthcare facilities to use resources at various levels, shifting the focus of laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, simplifying the selection process if necessary, identifying families of COVID-19 patients, and increasing the training of personnel and the number of respirators and extra beds.
There are different theories about where the first patient (called the patient-free) was originally organized.
The first case of the new coronavirus was identified on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of cases of the coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
These include the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which is associated with the sale of live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animal species; or, in other words, it originated from animals.The cluster pneumonia of unknown cause appeared on December 26 and was reported by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital in Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned colleagues about a SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenling, were threatened by the police for spreading false information and another, Ai Fen, was charged by her superiors for her role in the conspiracy.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public alert and notified the World Health Organization (WHO).
Many unidentified cases of pneumonia were reported to Wuhan authorities pending testing in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled in approximately seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other parts of China, fueled by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan becoming a transportation and rail exchange hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Retrospective official data shows that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had started showing early symptoms.As of March 26, the United States had received the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide from China and Italy.As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases had been reported worldwide, with more than 97,000 deaths and more than 364,000 confirmed cases.
Nearly 200 countries and territories will have at least one case.
Due to the global pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have banned free movement and introduced border controls.
International response has included control measures such as self-isolation (known as home quarantine, stay-at-home orders, or quarantine) and when people cannot leave their homes.As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under quarantine in the United States, more than 50 million people are in quarantine in the Philippines, 59 million people are in quarantine in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are in quarantine in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were under lockdown, which grew to 2.6 billion two days later, nearly a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was first detected on 1st November 2019 in Wuhan; according to unconfirmed reports, the first case was later on 17th November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia on December 26, which her Wuhan Jianghan hospital announced to the CDC on December 27.
The first strain test of the patient's vaccines on December 27, 2019 showed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public alert was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
WHO also received information on the same day.
As we were reminded, Wuhan doctors were warned by the police to avoid spreading the news of the outbreak.
"The Chinese National Health Commission initially said there was no 'clear evidence' of human-to-human transmission".
In late January, the Chinese government announced a massive campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping later called a "people's war".
The line of sanitization for travel in and out of Wuhan, which is described as the "largest intensive care center in the history of the world", was announced on January 23 and has spread to 15 cities in Hubei, reaching a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles has been increased in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
Officials suspended the construction of the Hoshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital Leishenshan Hospital was built to accommodate additional patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China has moved 14 other service areas in Wuhan, including convention centers and stadiums, to hospital premises.On January 26, it took other measures to control the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health notices to travelers and extending the Spring Festival.
Universities and schools were also closed.
Regions such as Hong Kong and Macau have taken several steps with regard to schools and universities.
I began working remotely in many parts of China.
Travel restrictions were lifted in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation has improved, and museums across China have been temporarily closed.
With the control of mass movement in many cities and the presence of some 760 million people (more than half of the country's population) subject to limited restrictions on travel, since the outbreak became global in March, Chinese authorities have taken strong measures to prevent the virus from spreading from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day travel ban on all international travellers entering the city.On March 23, I made the only domestic crossing in central China in five days, in this case a return flight from Istanbul to Guangzhou.
On 24 March 2020, Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of the disease domestically had been contained and the outbreak in China had been contained.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, a city in Wuhan province, after a two-month crackdown.China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020, that visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, with no further information on when the restrictions would end.
Parents who want to enter China must obtain a visa from Chinese buses or airlines.
The Chinese government has encouraged the reopening of businesses and factories on March 30, and provided financial incentives to enterprises.Although the State Council has urged families to move the celebration online as a means to maintain social distancing to prevent the new COVID-19 outbreak, the State Council has declared a national three-minute silence on March 4, coinciding with the Qingming Festival at 10:00 a.m.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread from China to South Korea on January 20, 2020.
The National Health Agency reported a sharp increase in cases on February 20, with large crowds spreading to the Shinchongi Jesuit Monastery.
Shincheonji Wuhan followers visit Daegu from the suspected site of the first outbreak
As of February 22, of the 9,336 churchgoers, 1,261 or 13% reported symptoms.South Korea declared a high level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on February 29.
A South Korean military base was identified after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected and thus changed.South Korea had initiated the world's largest and most systematic public virus screening program and isolated individuals and isolated parents who had contact with them.
The screening measures include mandatory reporting of new arrivals with symptoms via mobile applications, testing for the virus on arrival and the results being released the next day, and increasing testing capacity to test up to 20,000 people per day.
While the city as a whole has not improved, South Korea's program has been seen as successful in controlling the outbreak.South Korean public initially disagreed with President Moon Jae-in's response to the tragedy.
Many Koreans have collected signs on Moon's unstructured attack, calling for a charge or thanking him for his response.
On March 23, South Korea reported having the lowest number of cases per day in four weeks.
On March 29, it was reported that from April 1, international travelers would be staying for two weeks.
According to media reports, as of April 1, South Korea has received requests for virus research assistance from 121 different countries.
Iran announced the first SARS-CoV-2 case in Qomun on February 19, which, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, has since resulted in two deaths.

The laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and SARS-CoV-2 have identified mechanisms for detecting the presence of the virus and have isolated the antibodies produced to isolate foreign bodies from the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples was confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the corona virus RNA.
The test is specifically designed to detect the SARS-Cov-2 virus and RNA.
The test is used to detect the most recent and most recent disease.
Serology can be used to test and monitor the population.
Antibody tests show how many people are infected, including those whose symptoms are too low to report or who show no symptoms.
The exact mortality rate and the level of immunity that a population develops after contracting a disease can be determined from the results of the test.
For research reasons, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable data on the spread of the virus among their populations.
As of 23 March, the country had less than 3 percent of its population tested, so there is considerable variation in how many tests have been carried out so far in countries around the world.
This change could have a significant impact on the reported death rate, which in a few countries is estimated to be much higher.
The enzyme-containing method of reaction-reverse-reaction-repeated-reaction (rRT-PCR) testing can be performed using various techniques, including sampling of airway samples from the kidney to the bladder or sampling of the urethra.
The fruits are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing of the tongue of a mosquito, such as a mosquito, is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Over time, the virus can continue to multiply in the lungs and disappear in the lungs
For detected patients who are tested within the second week, film can be taken with a respirator via a suction catheter or sputum.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in January 2020 in Charité, Berlin using rapid-reaction transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and was approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) as the basis for a distribution of 250,000 devices.
The UK also developed a trial on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector (Coronavirus PowerChek) on 28 January 2020.
"The ""E"" gene is apparently shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene is found only in SARS-CoV2.In China, the BGI Group was among the first companies to receive emergency use authorization for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detector.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Diagnostic Panel 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is distributing Real-Time RT-PCR to the public through its laboratory's International Reagent Resource".
One of three genetic tests that resulted in unidentified results due to a chemical change in the test equipment that did not work, and a critical situation at the CDC in Atlanta, resulted in an average of less than 100 successful vaccines being administered daily throughout February 2020.
The validity of the two-body tests was not determined until January 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories were not authorized to begin trials until then.
The study was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Order (EUA), and U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of a nationwide RT-PCR-based COVID-19 test.
On March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics developed a similar COVID-19 vaccine that is available to the general population.
No quantity restrictions have been announced; collection and processing of the vaccine must be done according to CDC guidelines.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR was launched.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare.On March 12, 2020, on March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA Certification for its high-performance COVID-19 test that can be performed in 3.5 hours, so a machine can run approximately 4,128 tests with a 24-hour duration.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use order (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for the testing of the m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar orders to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, the same Cepheid vaccine received an EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute test.
The FDA has approved PCR testing using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology.
After this, the method, which does not require continuous rotation of the temperature, will produce a positive result in as little as five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently only about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott estimates that it will increase its production to provide 50,000 tests per day.A vaccine using a foreign-specific antibody that binds to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hopefully delivering results in 15 to 20 minutes, as fast as a flu test.
"A March 2020 review concluded that ""thoracic imaging in the early stages is of low diagnostic value, and CT results should be available before the onset of symptoms"".
Specific features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities with a distribution of spherical, unequal and posterior dna.
As the disease progresses, the flora grows, becomes cocorreal, and becomes stronger.
A touch-based source of infection in Wuhan currently competing with PCR CT suggests that CT is more sensitive than PCR, but the detection is low, with the characteristics of the snake showing a conflict with pneumonia and other infectious processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology advises against the use of CT scans for detection or first-line testing of COVID-19.As of March 2020, the CDC has approved PCR for the first test.
The immune response is a component of the detection of disease that includes the production of IgM and IgG antigens.
These are used to detect human exposure from 7 days or more after symptoms begin, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population.Tests can be conducted in central laboratories (CLT) or point-of-care testing (PoCT).
Advanced self-testing systems in many clinical laboratories can perform this test but availability depends on the speed of each system's development.
For CLT, a blood plasma sample is often used, and the samples collected can be used to monitor the immune response.
After PoCT, a single sample of blood is usually removed from the skin.
The PCR process does not require any pre-testing.As of March 26, 2020, the FDA has identified 29 companies that have notified the agency as being in need and are able to distribute their own antibody treatments.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test for emergency use has been approved by the FDA.In late March 2020, the Euroimmune Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European-approved diagnostic devices, which can detect foreign antibodies IgG and IgA in blood samples.
The detection capacity is several hundred samples per hour, so PCR virus RNA testing is much faster than conventional RNA testing.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of diagnosis.In early April, any antibody testing kit purchased by the UK was not safe for use under the conditions.
"Hong Kong has developed a system of home evacuation for suspected patients, with the emergency department providing a patient with a sample tube", in which they are inhaled, and sent back for later testing.The British NHS announced that it is testing a system for testing suspected cases at home, which will clear the patient if he or she arrives at the hospital without contacting others or if he or she has used an ambulance.In the case of COVID-19 suspected cases, it is appropriate to continue with self-care by driving through testing".
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2, that it has a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day in self-driving patient centers, and had tested 10,700 in the previous week.
When the examination is prescribed by a doctor, the cost is covered by the health insurance.
According to the Robert Koch Institute's president, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Starting on March 19, the three major cities began to conduct a search of the country's immigrant population.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany is unknown, as only positive results have been reported.
"On the 12/2020 week calendar, as revealed by the previous laboratory study, a total of at least 483,295 vaccines were tested, including 12/2020 week and 33,491 vaccines (6.9%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam hospitals have similarly developed and tested a method to screen 64 patients in a randomized controlled trial, combining vaccines and mixed vaccines if positive for further testing.The laboratory in Wuhan, whose emergency detection laboratory is named "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or English: "French") opened its own eyewitness survey on 5 February 2000 at BGI, which was conducted in 2020 and was able to identify more than 10,000 cases per day".
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the Hubei modeling case would have been 47% larger without the ability to come on line and the cost alone would have been more manageable.
Wuhan laboratory was immediately followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, all new in 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the number of tests conducted per day was 50,000.Open source, the complex design released by Origami Assays, can analyze samples of up to 1122 COVID-19 patients using just 93 assays.These compatible designs can be run in a small laboratory without the need for liquid-filled robots.
In March, shortages and insufficient data on the extent of the chemical change caused a major scandal for the EU and UK and US research.
This has led several authors to reluctantly release RNA genomes for further research in areas of vaccine preparation where vaccines are heated to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now conducting more population-specific coronavirus testing than any other country, and is on track to increase the testing scope to reach the entire population.
"This is achieved through a combination of vehicle-driven testing capabilities, and the purchase of a large-scale population-based laboratory from 42 Group and BGI (based on the "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratory in China)".
Built in 14 days, the laboratory can perform thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first of its kind in the world to be ready for service on this scale outside China.
Several studies of data sets for specific strains of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has received a grant from Germany to manufacture and export vaccines that low-income countries cannot afford to supply themselves.
The German (Ibsi) report was published on January 17, 2020; the US-developed guidelines were not available until January 28, U.S. studies being submitted in China and the United States were initially faced with problems with the reliability of shared diagnostic tools, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide the tools to meet the needs and recommendations of health professionals.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's large attendance for the trial has helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The testing capabilities, developed in a private branch laboratory, have been built up over the years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization issued a call for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.As the virus spread, the need for testing increased dramatically.This led to the accumulation of more tests in private laboratories in the U.S., and increased demand for the supply of rescues and test chemicals.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test equipment.
In the United States, the CDC-developed test kits were "flawed", and the government subsequently imposed bureaucratic tariffs that prohibited private testing.Spain purchased test kits from Chinese factory Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found their results to be inaccurate.
The factory explained that the reason for the wrong fruits was the failure of the harvesting process or the failure of the operating conditions.
The Spanish Ministry said it would eliminate the test kits for the negative results, replacing them with other test kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeconomy.80% of the test kits for the negative results were supplied from the Czech Republic to China.Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that the test kits be dumped into the Danube.Ateş Karaş, the Turkish Health Ministry's spokesman, said the test kits Turkey had requested from China contained "significant errors" and "we have used them".The UK had requested 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were not viable".
The study, which isolated positive test subjects and parents who had subsequent contact with positive SARS-CoV-2 subjects, showed positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Va, where the first COVID-19 case in Italy was reported, examined the entire population of the city of 3,400 for two rounds of ten days.
Half of the cases were asymptomatic, and all cases were isolated.
Restrictions on travel to cohabiting communities have completely eliminated newly diagnosed diseases.
Along with strict communications, travel restrictions, testing, and self-isolation, the 2020 coronavirus outbreak in Singapore was slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closures of restaurants and bars and single establishment.
Many restrictions have been lifted, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened after the holiday holiday on March 23.
Many other countries also controlled the epidemic with forced isolation, travel restrictions, testing, and quarantine, but with less stringent measures, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study of several countries found that the death rates were significantly lower when comparing death rates, possibly because these countries were better able to distinguish between mild and no symptoms.
WHO also noted that countries without testing capabilities and international laboratories with limited COVID-19 testing have sent their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 vaccines to one of 16 WHO laboratory sources for confirmation.
Of the 16 licensed laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the chart below, the category of Positive as % of tests is determined by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized patients has a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, with other factors being balanced.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the practice of cleaning one's hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing our hands at a critical time each day reduces the risk of many infectious diseases, such as gastroenteritis and cholera.
People with respiratory diseases such as influenza are at risk of contracting it, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose and mouth.
The most important time to wash our hands with soap is five times a day: before and after we take out the faeces, after we clean the baby, before feeding the baby, before and after preparing the food, and after eating or after we cooked meat, fish, and chicken.
If water and soap are not available, hand washing with a washcloth is recommended.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After washing the baby or changing the diaper.
Sneezing, coughing, or sneezing after covering your nose.
After a meal, a meal, or a bowl of stew.
Medical hand hygiene is accepted as a hygiene exercise for healthcare providers.
Washing hands before applying a disinfectant or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The main health benefits of handwashing are cleaning hands of infectious agents (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for those who work in the food service or healthcare sector, but it is also important for society as a whole.
Handwashing has health benefits such as reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, and preventing the spread of infectious agents and respiratory diseases.
And reducing infant mortality by sending home-based services.
A 2013 study found that regular hand washing contributes little to the lengthening of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the rate of infant deaths from diarrheal and other heart diseases can be reduced by simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate by 50%.
The pressure that encourages hand washing can reduce heart disease by as much as three times, which is equivalent to providing clean water to a dry land.
A 48% reduction in abdominal circumference may be associated with hand-washing with shampoo.One of the most cost-effective and cost-effective methods of preventing heartburn and acute respiratory syndrome (ARI) is the practice of unintentionally hand-washing at home, in schools, and in communities around the world.
Pneumonia, ARI said, is the leading cause of death for children under five years of age, claiming an estimated 1.8 million babies every year.
Heart disease and pneumonia are linked to the deaths of about 3.5 million children every year.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap after toileting and before meals is more important than any other vaccination or treatment, and it reduces deaths from heart disease by half and respiratory problems by a quarter.
Hand hygiene is always associated with water purification, and other sanitation programs.
Washing your hands also prevents the spread of skin diseases, which are spread by direct contact.
A small amount of handwashing, but repeated handwashing can dry out the skin and damage it.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause itchy hands, also known as hand eczema or dermatitis, and can harm healthcare workers.
But now, handwashing is viewed as a symptom of a serious illness, even an obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times to wash hands with soap during the day to prevent the transmission of disease: after using the toilet (after washing and removing feces), after cleaning the baby, before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after cooking, or after touching a piece of meat, fish or chicken.
On the other hand, washing our hands before and after cutting wounds, coughing, coughing, or touching the nose, after touching animal carcasses, or after touching an animal, or after washing a litter box, reduces the risk of infection.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be a low-level activity.
A handwashing study conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38.7% of households practiced handwashing with hand sanitizer.A 2014 study found Saudi Arabia to be the top with 97%, the United States in the middle with 77%, and China was in the bottom with 23%.There are now several ways to improve handwashing habits at critical times.One of the ways in which the practice of handwashing is becoming more common in developing countries is by students washing their hands in groups during the daytime.
The Basic Health Care Program implemented in the Philippines through the Education Directive is an example of a step-by-step approach designed to promote child health and education.
In addition to taking the medicine twice a year, washing hands with soap and brushing teeth daily with fluoride are the main elements of the international program.
It is also being used successfully in Indonesia.
The most microscopic organisms are removed from the skin by adding a soap or a cleanser to the water.
The main task of soap and cleaning is to turn the problem into a philosophy and increase the prosperity.
Since the fat and protein are not soluble in water, it is not enough to wash your hands with water alone.
The clean-up was supported by a sufficient water supply.
Because soap has to be recycled, it may contain bacteria left over from the original use.
Some studies on the transmission of bacteria from contaminated soap suggest that it is unlikely that bacteria will pass through the soap because it is washed with heat.
CDC says it is still being selected to distribute hand-held wastewater treatment.
Antibacterial soaps are being widely advertised in the health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence for the use of natural selection for wound healing or antibiotic antibiotic use.
However, antibacterial soap has an effect on the immune system, such as triclosan.
Therefore, even if the antibacterial strains are not selected by the antibacterial sampling, their effectiveness may not be as high as reported.
In addition to our skincare products, we should have acidic formulations (acetic acid, acorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH controls. Benzoic acid and skin cleansers (vegetable oils, vitamins, menthol, etc.). Research from the Oregon Department of Public Health shows that soap alone is as beneficial as the use level.
The best water for hand washing is not enough to kill bacteria
Bacteria grow faster at a temperature of 37°C.
However, it is more susceptible to natural oils and bacteria than is cold, warm, and soapy water.
Although it is widely believed that using hot water reduces the number of bacteria in the hands, scientific studies have shown that it is not effective.
Sanitizer and hand sanitizer are hand sanitizers that do not contain water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizer, antibacterial hand sanitizer, or hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity in the late 1990s and early 21st century.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol and solvents such as carbonate (polymeric acetic acid) in gel, adding glycerin to the liquid, or adding sponges to facilitate serving and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding hydrogen peroxide to water will increase the activity of antibacterial agents.Hand sanitizer containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol will effectively kill germs.
Alcoholic hand sanitizers kill bacteria, multiple drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), pneumonia, and some viruses (including HIV, rubella, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
The 70% alcohol cleanser kills 99.97% of the bacteria in the hand after 30 seconds of hand washing (equivalent to 3.5 decibels of cleaning), and kills 99.99% to 99.999% (four to five cleanses) after 1 minute of hand washing. Hand cleansers are most effective at killing bacteria, and have low efficacy in killing some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective at completely eliminating the virus of the norovirus type (or Norovirus), which is the most common cause of infectious heart and lung disease.To properly soak and rub both hands, we must use an antibacterial or alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Rub the front and back of both hands and between and at the tip of the fingers for about 30 seconds until the liquid or liquid dries.
The toothpick should be washed thoroughly, and the toothpick should be properly dried.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with soap rather than using a sanitizer, especially when our hands are dirty.
The increased use of this service is based on its ease of use and fast killing effect on microorganisms, but it cannot replace soap and water on its own.
Repeated use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer can dry the skin without the addition of lotion and/or a skin softener.
The effects of alcohol withdrawal can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other ointments to the formula.
In the treatment of patients, body-washing and body-healing are performed with alcohol-based hand sanitizers and skin-washing products, including soaps and antibacterial detergents.
Allergic skin burns, inflammatory symptoms, or cold sores from alcohol or alcohol-based hand sanitizer are also common.
The easy way to get skin irritation is more appealing than washing your hands with soap.
Water-based products are useful but do not wash away organic matter except to keep hands free from contamination.
Therefore, sanitizer does not prevent the spread of bacteria or viruses until soap and water are used, as bacteria or viruses will still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is dependent on the ingredients and method of preparation, and historically alcohol and alcohol-free hand sanitizer have been used in a very subpar manner.
Recently, a proposed method for the use of benzalkonium chloride has shown to have high immunity and antimicrobial activity, as the use of alcohol after repeated use does not decrease, mostly due to the process of dehydration.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap, so they use soap bars or grass.
It is more beneficial to use a pot or soil than just water, even if you don't have enough to drink.
On the one hand, if soil or soil is contaminated with microorganisms, it will spread the disease by reducing the spread of the disease.
The reason is that when it is mixed with water, it forms an alkaline compound, which like soap, kills bacteria.
WHO notes that smoke or dust on the day of soap spraying can serve as a soap.
The handwashing procedures recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are as follows:
Dry hands in cold or cold water.
The choice of running water is because stored water can be contaminated, and the temperature of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Wash hands thoroughly with proper soap, including the back of the neck, between the fingers and the forehead.
Soap is a good way to wash hands.Studies have shown that people wash their hands properly not only with water but also with breathing.
Hold for at least 20 seconds.
The thickening creates a layer of pigment that is removed from the skin, while the longer the layer lasts, the more pigment is produced.
Wash thoroughly under running water.
Washing our hands in a bathtub can get dirty again.
Put on a clean sheet or let the air cool.
The hands and fingers are easily infected, and the areas that are usually neglected are the thumb, the upper arm, the middle and lower fingers.
The human genome can contain a microorganism underneath it.
Using a skin softener is often recommended to protect the hands from scratches; untreated skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection.
There are options for less expensive handwashing where soap and water are not available, such as using a small cup/drinker in developing countries when draining from plastic water containers.Where there is a shortage of water (such as schools and rural areas in developing countries), alternative water treatment methods such as tip-tap and low-cost water treatment are available.
The pump is a simple technology with a jerry-pump attached to the string, and a foot-controlled water pump, which uses a hand-pumped water pump and a shampoo.
Proper handwashing is a fundamental part of hand hygiene, but there is still debate in public toilets as to which type of handwashing is the most effective.
Many studies recommend that hand dryers in many bathrooms are cleaner than electric ones.
In 2008, a study conducted at the University of Westminster, London and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene of hand dryers and air conditioners.
After hand washing and hand-drying with a hot air conditioner, the total number of bacteria found in the fingers increased by an average of 194%, and in the journal by 254%.
Drying hands with jet air increases the total number of bacteria on the fingertips by 42% and the number of bacteria in the palm by 15%.
After washing our hands and drying them with a towel, 76% of the bacteria are removed from our fingers and 77% from our hands.Scientists are studying how contaminated toilets pass from the toilet to the user.
The air dryer, which removes critical wind speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph) from equipment, can also destroy micro-organisms on hands and equipment, and can contaminate bathrooms and bathroom users up to a distance of 2 meters.
Using a hand-held vacuum cleaner allows the microorganism to travel 0.25 meters from the table.
The paper studies did not reveal any serious transmission of microorganisms.In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt evaluated various handwashing methods.
The following bacterial mutations were observed:
Many dryers were closed down, and the clothes were more popular.
When travelling to areas where there is no soap and water, hand sanitizer with a chemical towel is an option.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Handwashing became mandatory in hospitals after Hungarian doctor Ignacy Semmelweis discovered the effect of the immune system in hospital environments (in 1846).
Medical staff are being reminded to wash their hands electronically when they forget to.
One study found that their use reduced the risk of infection.
Handwashing is the practice of washing all parts of the hands thoroughly with soap or gel for at least 15 seconds.
Our right hand must be balanced and bent.
If there is dirt under the finger, the hairbrush is used to remove the dirt.
It is important to wash your hands and dry clean clothes, as the water on your hands can get stuck.
After dipping our hands, we should use a paper towel to close the pump (and, if necessary, open the exit door).
This helps to prevent the hand from getting contaminated again.
In the context of health care, the goal of handwashing is to remove microorganisms that cause disease ( germs) and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of handwashing in the medical community has reached unacceptable levels, and that a large number of doctors and nurses are completely forgetting that they need to wash their hands before contracting disease, and are therefore spreading microorganisms.
One study found that hand washing and other laxative procedures can reduce blood flow-related catheter infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has increased the number of hand washing and laxative procedures in the health sector.
The company's direct hand sanitizer is available for public comment on their website.
Critical research was done by Whitby and others.
If the vending machines are required to comply with the regulations, they can measure and verify hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization has five times for hand washing:
After exposure to blood/excretion
before the bacterial clearance process, and
After treatment: Adding a cleaning chemical to soap (soap "damaged" or "germ-killing") speaks to the washer about the practice of killing.
Such substances are known as surgical or antibiotic resistant organisms.Operations require the use of a self-opening and self-closing hand washing machine, chlorhexidine or iodine for proper washing of the underarm, hand-drying cloth and other cleaning products.
You must take off all jewelry.
This involves washing our hands for 2-6 minutes from dawn to dusk.
Not necessary for longer than 10 minutes.
When using water, it should be avoided that the water from the toilet reaches the hands.
After the hand washing, the hands are cleaned with a clean towel and a surgical cloth is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash hands or use hand sanitizer before and after contact with the patient.
In the control of staph infection in hospitals, hand sanitization is reduced by 20% and is more effective when hand sanitization is increased to 35%.
Washing soaps lightly is more likely to spread bacterial infections through food than washing with antibacterial soap, and using an antibacterial soap is 26% more effective than washing with an alcohol-based sanitizer for 30 seconds.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand sanitizers in reducing the spread of influenza A H1N1 and Clostridium difficile.In order to maintain hand hygiene in health care, hand washing, hand sanitizer instruction and written and audio reminders are essential for workers.
More research is needed to determine whether these effects are beneficial in the healthcare system.
In developing countries, hand washing is considered an expensive, health-promoting, and even nutritious activity.
However, the lack of access to water, ventilation or handwashing facilities at home, school and workplaces affects the development of global handwashing practices.
For example, in most rural Africa, there are few plumbing systems available for private or public toilets, even when there are difficult options for building handwashing facilities.
However, the problem with hand washing is not due to lack of soap and water, but due to the gentle washing habits.
Publicity and public support for handwashing can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the consequences, and lead to lasting moral change.
To be successful, supervision and control are essential.
A study of 70 studies found that the effectiveness of handwashing in low- and middle-income countries is low-budget social marketing campaigns, but community-based methods are effective.One example of a school handwashing ad is the UNICEF Three Star Plan, which encourages schools to take simple and costly steps to remove other hygiene standards.
If they meet the basic requirements, they can eventually move from one to three star schools.
Facilitating handwashing facilities and promoting handwashing can help reduce childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a consciousness-raising campaign that seeks to encourage behavioral change.Due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has made it clear that it is adopting a handwashing symbol.
A few studies estimate that the effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries has disrupted DALYs relationships.
However, according to one source, the average cost of handwashing advertising is higher than that of water and sanitation.
The effects of hand washing on human health, especially in vulnerable populations, such as midwives and hospital wounded soldiers, were first studied in the mid-19th century by two leading hygienists: Hungarian physician Ignacy Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Ngel, the English pioneer of modern nursing.
Many people still believed that diseases were caused by the poisonous odors of spices.
In the 1980s, foodborne illnesses and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to become more vigilant in promoting hygiene as a necessary method of preventing the spread of contamination.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have increased awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with hand sanitizer to prevent such infectious diseases.
For example, a warning about "clean hand washing" has been issued in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The wine of the washing of hands means to decline to accept responsibility or to agree to participate in it.
This is a passage from the Bible's Gospel of Matthew, in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the condemnation of Jesus Christ, but it has become a more widespread term in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Mrs. Macbeth begins to wash her hands like a stone in an attempt to clear her mind of the filth she thought she had, which blamed her for the crime she had committed and had her husband commit.
People should wash their hands more often and pay more for hand washing equipment after thinking or thinking about unorthodox practices.
In addition, parents who are allowed to wash their hands after such observances do not participate in many cleaning practices such as free salutes.
The religious practice of hand washing is also used for hygiene and for symbolic purposes. Hand washing without soap is practiced in many religions, such as the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Tevi'la and Netilat, Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
In Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands after using the toilet is mandatory.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam, washing hands before and after meals is mandatory.
Control of workplace risks beyond COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace hazard control is the implementation of workplace safety and health practices to prevent and manage the risks of the 2019 coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).
Effective workplace risk management based on the workplace and workplace, estimating sources of exposure, severity of disease in the community, and the risks to individual workers of exposure to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have less workplace interaction with the public and the department, including basic diagnostic prevention techniques, hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene, and periodic cleanup and disinfection of the workplace.
Medium-risk activities include those requiring frequent or recent contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but should be considered for community transmission or global travel.
This includes those who work with the public, such as schools, areas with high population density, and single organizers of higher infrastructure.
Risk control measures for this group, including basic diagnostic prevention methods, include high-quality ventilation using high-quality airwaves, sneezing, and having a personal immunization device in case of COVID-19 infection.
OSHA considers health care and mortuary workers who are exposed to people with or suspected of COVID-19 to be at high risk, including when workers are working in air bubble processes, or when they are collecting vaccines from people with or suspected of COVID-19.
The most appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as four high pressure pressure pressure units, and personal protective equipment appropriate for the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many impacts on the workplace.
Worrying workers should be eliminated because of illness, because they want to take care of others, or because of the risk of exposure.
The nature of business is changing, with demand for products and the means to obtain them (e.g. buying watches without a watch and buying services from the car).
Finally, cargo can be disconnected from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19.Epidemic preparedness and response planning can be used to guide preventive action.
The trainers discuss the levels of risk in many workplaces and occupations, including sources of exposure, risks to the home and community, and personal factors such as ageing or long-term disability.
They also identify the necessary precautions to prevent the spread of infectious diseases and whether or not to plan for the onset of disease.
Preparedness for communicable diseases and prevention programmes should be improved with national and sectoral input.
The objectives of response to an outbreak include: reducing the spread of disease among employees in a workplace, protecting people with other diseases, those who may be at risk, maintaining work activities, and reducing the impact on other elements in the supply chain.
The violence of the business community is affecting the responses that are being made.
Risk management guidelines are widely used to collect and manage the most important risks in occupational safety and health.
In areas where the COVID-19 risk cannot be eliminated, effective controls are engineering controls, administrative monitoring controls, and ultimately personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve separating workers from work-related hazards that are not dependent on worker behavior, and can be a very cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls require changes in workplace policies or procedures to make an employee or employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposure.
All types of PPE should be as flexible as possible (e.g., mouth and nose respirators), consistent and properly worn, regularly checked, maintained, and replaced, as needed, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or disposed of to prevent contamination, depending on the risks to the worker.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have little workplace interaction with the public and the government.
The basic prevention measures for all workplaces are recommended to wash hands frequently and thoroughly, encourage workers to stay home if they are sick, cover the respiratory tract including cough and wheezing, dispose of nasal decongestants and clean bags, arrange for telecommunications or emergency shifts if necessary, prevent workers from using various equipment, and keep the workplace clean and unpolluted during use.
Immediate, isolated quarantine is a vital step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and other workplaces from potentially contagious diseases.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that emergency room staff with symptoms of respiratory illness stay home for at least 24 hours without burns, burns, or any other symptoms of burns or other symptoms-modifying medications, and that immigrants who change their work permits due to illness, employees who rescue a family member with a disease, and immigrant workers know about these policies.
According to OSHA, the mid-risk occupations include frequent or self-reported contact within a distance of up to 1.8m with unknown persons or suspected COVID-19 infections, but who are caught accidentally in the immediate community due to the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in local markets or because the person has recently traveled abroad where COVID-19 has spread.
This includes the provision of services to employees who have access to the general public, such as schools, public workplaces, where mass gambling is carried out. For these and other high-risk groups, the establishment of high-quality air purifiers for engineering controls, increasing the amount of air infiltration, implementing visible preventive measures such as plastic anti-smoke monitors, wearing safety glasses in the windows of cars, providing personal training to the staff who work with all the management equipment available. Government measures including those that promote high-risk workplaces, including encouraging workers to stay home and avoid infections, meeting places and press conferences, and providing emergency medical and safety measures to workers, including the provision of emergency preparedness and emergency preparedness, the provision of COVID-19 vaccines, and the provision of emergency preparedness and emergency preparedness, the provision of emergency preparedness and emergency preparedness, the provision of emergency preparedness and emergency preparedness, the provision of emergency medical and emergency medical services, and the provision of COVID-19 vaccines at the appropriate time.
The workers in this accident group rarely need the use of respirators.
If an injured person is on board, appropriate surveillance to protect crew and other passengers includes keeping the injured person at a distance of 6 feet from others, assigning a member of the flight crew to serve the injured person, and requesting the injured person to be provided with a face mask or to cover his or her mouth and nose with a cloth when coughing or sneezing.
Airline passengers who contact a patient during a flight or touch bodily fluids or highly contaminated objects should wear disposable hand-washing garments, and additional personal protective equipment should be worn in case of a flight in which the patient is exposed to body heat, persistent cough and breathing.
Handbags and other disposable items should be disposed of in biohazard bags, and contaminated containers should then be cleaned and disinfected.Incident control, including commercial cruise ships and other passenger ships, includes postponing travel when illness is detected, and isolating only if they have burns or other symptoms while on board, and immediately reporting to the onboard health center.
Ideally, follow-up treatment should be done in a segregated ward. Regarding school and child care facilities, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that they be temporarily closed for antibacterial and disinfectant purposes if an infected person is in the school building, even when the disease has not spread in the community.
When transmission occurs in small to medium-sized communities, physical distancing strategies such as evacuation, mass gatherings and mass gatherings such as fitness classes or choir classes or cafeteria feeds, increased space between tables, facilitating separate arrivals and departures, limiting non-essential visitors, and the use of specialized health facilities for children with flu-like symptoms may be implemented.
With the spread of the virus in the local community increasing, social distancing, and the need for long-term school closures, the CDC has listed the number of emergency medical services that are being served by workers who are engaged in routine work.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
In the event of a near contact, workers should clean and disinfect the work belt and grill with a household sower or vacuum cleaner before reuse, and follow common procedures for inspecting and disposing of used PPE and loading and wiping clothes.
OSHA recognizes health care and mortuary workers as being at or above the risk of high-risk suicide.
The most dangerous tasks such as healthcare delivery, rescue, laboratory and transportation of healthcare workers who are known or suspected to be exposed to COVID-19 patients.
This is a very high risk if workers are involved in the process of generating air bubbles, or collecting or handling contaminants from infected or suspected COVID-19 patients.
The procedure includes ventilation with a ventilator, a cough-inducing procedure, bronchoscopies, procedures and a few dental examinations, or a selective collection of dental sealants.
High-risk mortuary operations involve the preparation of organs from personnel who are confirmed to have COVID-19 at the time of death or have suspected cases; this is a much higher risk of exposure if they conduct autopsies.Additional engineering controls for high-risk groups include isolation of patients with known or suspected COVID-19 during ventilation procedures.
Perhaps the unique atmospheric pressure of the altitude is appropriate for health care and the organization of a few cadavers.
Biosafety precautions at level 3 should be taken together.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that newly arrived patients should be isolated in isolation centers based on suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition to PPE, OSHA recommends that parents with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection work within a distance of 6 feet and parents who perform ventilation procedures use mouth and nose ventilators.
In the United States, oral and nasal respirators with N95 masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in a comprehensive respiratory screening program, including training and clinical evaluation.
Specific types of mouth and nose respirators provide miraculous protection and enhance the comfort of the worker.WHO does not recommend full body coveralls, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by body fluids.
WHO has approved the surgical procedure for the patient who performs the radiation from the entrance.
For respiratory care providers, or collecting COVID-19 patients from transportation routes without creating air bubbles, WHO recommends surgical gloves, eyeglasses or face masks, gloves, and gloves.
If the procedure is performed with a ventilation bubble, the surgical needle N95 or the mouth and nose ventilator FFP2 is used instead.
The lack of global supply of PPE, WHO's need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as window shutters, allowing only people involved in direct care to access the COVID-19 patient unit, use of PPE for specific uses, use of the same mouth and nose respirator when providing the same treatment to multiple patients without the need for multiple tests, and the use of PPE channels to monitor and coordinate, have reduced the risk of untreated exposure to non-symptomatic patients.

TITLE: [Covid-19] easing the situation and preparing for the pandemic.
The date and time of the event is March 14, 2020.
CC0: All rights are reserved.
We saw this month in a wonderful way.
The rapidly spreading COVID-19 pandemic is a reminder of our global humanity and our responsibility to each other.
We do not have a preconceived notion of what an argument is, but our universal response depends on understanding the world's feelings, collaboration, and social construction that sits at the heart of the institution.
The sense of honesty and care we have experienced in our work through e-mail, phone calls, and chat is a remarkable testament to the humanity we have been given to work with.
I cannot be more grateful than to count you all as my friends.
Last week, several people expressed their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the world to return to Wikipedia now, and what a powerful symbol this vital resource is available to everyone from the very beginning.
Your work will do that if you keep the workplace functioning, or keep our friends paying, or if you keep our community peaceful.
The world needs Wikipedia's information, more than ever.
Not only what we do but how we do it will have a significant impact on the earth.
In view of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will make some necessary adjustments in the way we work together starting next week.
Changes in our work and schedule.
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the group met last night to discuss our schedule and schedule.
In that talk, we considered a balanced response to what we were facing and thought it would be a good way to keep the organization going in this time.
We wanted to ease the stress and support our mission for a long time.
If you want to call back, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors, and contractors:
Our daily expectation is 4 hours of work per day, or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We are not announcing holidays  if you can work extra hours, the angel can use you.
Yet, the world is not perfect, and whether you want to care for a loved one, make friends, or visit a doctor, your health is our priority.
We are not wasting your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should not be said, but we are.
No sick days or PTOs required - inform your supervisor and help your team review schedules to ensure that key workplaces and calendars are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, let T&amp;C Ops' Brian know to ensure T&amp;C will provide support and that your situation will receive the appropriate attention from the government.)
Full-time workers are paid full wages.
We have done it before, and we have offered ourselves again and again to the determination of contractors and our clients to reduce our daily workload.
Each worker was paid according to the hours he had worked in the country.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we can help you.
Many people use the work of the world around us as a way to share their anxieties.
Especially in such times, our service is wonderfully rewarding.
Again, this is a personal matter.
We ask that you contact your supervisor so that we can determine what to expect and adjust the situation accordingly.
Few tasks are considered necessary.
There are a few things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and support groups (among others) perform critical tasks that require additional support.
We will begin the process of reviewing current objectives with all departments and shift our focus to what is important to support our mission.
We all have a lot of work to do, and we are focused on the most important projects.
It will no longer hurt.
Once the attack is over, we don't plan to meet again
You are not expected to work overtime to get to work on the day of the end of the work, which is now far from the truth.
We accept changes in our circumstances, and where necessary, we work to set new goals and schedule.
What will happen with the APP?
To facilitate our new understanding and estimated hours of work, we decided to make it easier to submit our 2020-2021 Year Plan.
Our idea is to plan to extend our 2019-2020 plan to allow employees to spend extra time on budget-critical work, personal care, and caring for loved ones while parents want to work on a split schedule or are concentrating on aspirations in the next few weeks.
This length of time greatly reduces the amount of work currently planned and the overall pressure on the organization.
We will present our invention to the Board next week and as soon as we have confirmation we will announce the next steps for the representatives and teams.
Thank you APP team for your leadership here.
Office conditions, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, I learned that one of our coworkers, who lives in SF, may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
But we wanted to be extra careful, so we hired an anti-virus team from the San Francisco office to free it all up.
They used anti-virus bubbles to clean up the virus on all hospital floors, as well as in the lobby and around the windows of our hall.
The building is implementing its own mandatory maintenance guidelines using safety manufacturers who support their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is well-prepared for our return visit.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 guidance with us and all DC staff members.
As of last week, our DC Office has been completely switched to remote coordination with guidance from San Francisco.
As soon as a few of the residents of New York City learned about our work, we were in talks to rent a building in Brooklyn.
But such ongoing discussions are worth the wait.
Some of my coworkers are working remotely for the first time.
Those who have worked with us for years know that you may need to adjust and would like to give you some suggestions.
If the meeting is too long, limit it to an extra hour or two.
If a long discussion is needed, think about how you can break it down over several days.
Explain the program carefully, keep an agenda, and send reading materials ahead of time.
Take the lead with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate photos, interviews and live communication.
Have a conductor to organize each meeting, a question-and-answer chair, a note-taker to assist with the presentation, and a note-taker (or a note-taker).
If you need a convenient headset, email tech support.
Use the money you were paid for your health in return for honor.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your friends about your shared work
The HR team is considering the inclusion of a linear training-based ergonomics guideline to support the distribution of jobs in the Department.
This past week we asked all community donors to post Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as editathons, until WHO declares the pandemic has ended.
We would inform them that our question would remove any other limitations that would make it impossible for them to complete their donation activities and that anyone who occupied or improved the houses would not be penalized.
We will follow up this coming week with further initiatives from Wikimedia and other environmental and community-based forums.
The general feeling from the global community is that both seem saddened by the chaos but openly relaxed and focused on the potential of their communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
Moving forward, CRT is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a platform for the community to control the pressure and to keep up with our interactions with them.
Stay up to date on COVID-19 issues.
We are sending out invitations to your program for a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00UTC/07:00PT.
We also spend time sharing new information, answering questions, and hanging out.
We are in this together and we are here to help in any way we can.
As such, you can continue to search for information from this email, as well as other relevant information related to COVID-19, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages and all the updated information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with workers in many affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, travel documents, workplace coverage, or any other support you may need, please do not hesitate to contact CRT and work with us.
We are here to provide support and work with others according to need.
If you have any questions or concerns, please email Bryan Judd - Director of HR International Global Operations
None of these changes should be viewed as a way to remove us from our duties and responsibilities.
Rather, they must adjust to the new realities of life, work, and obligations that are unprecedented.
These are steps that we believe are permanent steps to support each other so we can continue to work together, provide our activities with the support they need, and share their services to the world.
Our planned work will be there when the time comes.
Now is the time to support one another and to create a space for the important work to be done in the weeks and months ahead.
We want all of you to do that, and we want all of you to protect yourselves and your families so that you are safely in the event of a crisis.
Now, wash your hands and keep your face clean!
The project is being developed by the company's own team of experts, including Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the entire management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b) Enzyme-antigenase mutation 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the outer membrane (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and spleen.
ACE2 reduces the amount of angiotensin-II and increases the activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) response, which is a promising drug for the treatment of heart disease. ACE2 helps some coronaviruses to gain entry into cells.
The human type of this enzyme is called hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a double zinc metalloenzyme found in endothelial tissue and other cells.
The ACE2 peptide protein also contains an M2-linked N domain and an amino acid-linked C domain.
ACE2 is absorbed by the single membrane transport of protein I, a non-pathogenic enzyme, into the body of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular ACE2 domain is secreted from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called thrase, the resulting digestible protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually incorporated into the tissue.
ACE2 is found in most tissues: ACE2 is found in the cell membrane of type II pulmonary alveolar cells, endocytes of the spinal cord, endothelial cells of the veins and arteries, and in most tissues, it is found attached to the muscle cells of the arterial wall.
ACE2 mRNA expression is found in the cortex of the brain, stratum, hypothalamus, and even in the central part of the brain.
The primary function of ACE2 is to regulate ACE levels.
ACE binds the hormone angiotensin I to the angiotensin II in the liver.
ACE2 in turn is a carboxylic-terminal amino acid that is hydrolysed by the removal of phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysed to the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
ACE2 can also detect many peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradycyanin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 is a membrane receptor that regulates the repeat of the neutral amino acid SLC6A19, which is expressed in Hartinapy disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is involved in the entry of the coronavirus into cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (causing SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19 virus).
In particular, high binding of S1 proteins associated with SARS-Cov and SARS-Cov2 induces endocytosis from the cell body by the enzyme ACE2 domain and induces the fusion of viral and endosome enzymes in the cell.
This procedure also requires the TMPRSS2 serine protease-gated receptor protein S, which is currently under investigation as a potential treatment.This has led to some speculation that it reduces ACE2 levels, in cells, as a means of fighting infection.
However, several expert groups and regulatory bodies have recommended ACE inhibitors and effective ARP therapy.
"A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% higher reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls"".
In particular, pneumonia was reduced in patients at high risk of pneumonia, particularly those with stroke and heart failure who received ACE-lowering therapy.
"The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in lung death, although the effect is slightly greater than the overall risk of lung disease. """
Recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel vaccine for pneumonia, and may help with rapid circulation and oxygen regulation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 from its initial value in humans is 10 hours and the onset of activity is 30 minutes, with the duration of the (sudden) half-life of 24 hours.
Several studies suggest that rhACE2 is a promising drug for the specific impairment of the renin-angiotensin system in RAS inhibitors or patients with high angiotensin II-dependent disorders.RhACE2 is being studied in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory system symptoms.
"The benefits of b'COVID-19 mosaic use of mobile phones are designed to track the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak in all countries, i.e. to identify the pattern of people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with the identified person".
Many applications were openly restricted by government funding and developed or copied under a few licenses.
A number of methods have been developed to build a communications network.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding the geographic location systems of users.
It uses a small selection of intermediate bluetooth connections that allow the phone to connect to the newly used ones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would jointly integrate functions to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly on their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has released an app that allows citizens to check if they have contacts with someone with COVID-19.
It is available in over 200 Chinese cities.In Singapore, the TraceTogether app is already in use.
"The application, developed by the local IT community, is released as open source and provided to the government.North Macedonia will provide an immediate response to the "StopCorona!" Bluetooth-based exposure of vulnerable individuals and healthcare providers".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government said a similar stockpile of work was in the development stage and could be available in the course of the week, with similar work planned in Ireland and France.
Australia and New Zealand are both evaluating Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia wants to introduce a geo-fencing app to detect COVID-19 cases in Moscow, and to determine whether they leave the house.
Ross Anderson, professor of cryptography at Cambridge University, lists a number of solutions to qualified medical problems based on a system of studies, including false positives and failure to reach a target population.
To address the issue of the spread of the "coronavirus" app, Apple has limited the number of companies that can add coronavirus-related apps to its app store, limiting the distribution to those who have been given credentials or, if not, to trusted companies.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
The private sector has expressed its views on the use of coronavirus surveillance by the public, in particular on the development of the coronavirus surveillance framework in all countries, which should be addressed once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a call for such restrictions.
Government contractors have announced eight major projects:
The management is expected to be legal, relevant and flexible.
The extension is to be checked and controlled to the west coast;
The use of data for COVID-19 purposes should be limited;
The security and confidentiality of data depends on the accurate representation of what is expected and protected.
digital surveillance should avoid discrimination and limitations.
any sharing of data with third parties shall be legally construed;
There should be a call for freedom and the right of citizens to defend themselves against the scourge.
"A meaningful participation of all stakeholders, including public health professionals and neglected sectors of society, is needed.The German Computer Classification Commission (CCC) and the Reporter Oheine Grenzeni (RSF) have provided the checklists".
Google/Apple's plan to remove the operating system from their devices when it is no longer needed is aimed at solving the problems of tracking.
A few countries have used the app's location-based network-based browser to reduce the need for the app to be installed and the ability to prevent intrusion.
A network-based satellite system has been approved in Israel.
Strong-based solutions to the data center problem have their own problems.
However, not all central-calendar systems have to have a data-on-a-site method; many private-key systems have been developed that use central-calendar only for communication (see below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system created a communication system.
Instead of using an app, the system can identify data from various sources including mobile phones and carry data transmission cards, and inform the patient after they have been compiled.
In addition, the use of information precautions to prevent possible conflicts, and the government's public information space, has been decriminalized in the country since the MERS outbreak, due to the shift in the policy of distance from information.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites, and countries including Germany are considering the possibility of using an inter-governmental system that can protect privacy.
As of 6 April 2020, its release has not yet been announced.
The investigation team will go back to at least 2013 to find the basic theory that the communications were not established and kept secret.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen experts were working on open secret debates, such as the Blue Anse Mini-BLE, using the latest in incoming calls.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that includes both centralized and non-centralized processes, and is not a set guideline.Non-centralized guidelines include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, e.g. Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) and others.
Under these protocols, personal identification data never leaves the table, and all contact is on-device.
The MIT Data Lab's Privacy Team is working on a field called SafePlace, which will be used to protect privacy-sensitive data when data is collected and stored or when it is used to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
He further explored "Tor Apps: Protecting Privacy in Attacks" published in March 2020.Another similar initiative is the field of SafeTrees, a company developing privacy technologies, initially based in the MIT Information Lab, owned by Injma MPC.
SafeTech Technologies protects hardware users from sharing their location and health data with other users and the law, without compromising data privacy.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed to bring together the same ideas and protocols from the founding groups, with the goal of eliminating the arms race, and to enable the world to work together to eliminate and revive the key adoption barrier of the app.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the Blue Trace protocol open for government-owned apps.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the leading Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced the launch of microprocessor tracking, based on Bluetooth low-power technology and personal-signal cryptography.
They have also published a book that provides a key technology in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is expected to go through three stages:
to enable governments to create tools that allow private users to legally protect their privacy.
The combination of the more general iOS and Android interface and the Google and Apple plans to take control and prevent it is the basis for initially disseminating new information, and later to address similar concerns.
Drug re-use (also known as drug reuse, drug re-introduction, drug re-use, or drug reverse) is the reuse of an approved drug for a purpose other than its original use in the treatment of a disease or medical condition.
This is the most convincing line of scientific research currently available for effective treatment of COVID-19.
Other research areas include the search for COVID-19 vaccines and malignant plasma transmission.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug proteins, all of which have high binding affinity.
Considering these related sources, the most effective vaccine work is on finding the anti-protein for COVID-19.
The most important sperm proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include proteases such as papain, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicase, protein S, and ADP ribosphate.
Husein A, et al. analyzed and corrected multiple candidate compounds with the same tissue composition as the most confirmed drug, accelerating the development of a robust anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in its previous symptomatic study and making it a candidate for design in clinical trials.
Chloroquine is also used as an antimalarial drug for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine are one of four drugs being tested as part of the clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the state of New York will begin chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine treatments on March 24.On March 28, the FDA approved the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate as EUA.
The treatment was approved under the EUA for use as a pilot treatment, for emergency treatment, for patients who are not FDA-approved and cannot receive treatment in hospital.
According to the CDC, "the use, dosage, or route of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or diagnostic therapy for SARS-CoV-2" has not yet been established.
Doctors are saying that I will use a drug that has no other alternative.
A research group in Istanbul, Turkey is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU School of Medicine is conducting trials on the safety and efficacy of the use of hydroxychloroquine for prevention.
"Clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen, China, have tried to prove favipiravir is ""clearly effective"".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients received negative test results in an average of 4 days, while the remaining 45 patients did not receive treatment, with a duration of illness of 11 days.

The bA COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no clinically proven vaccine is available, there are several attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 f virus to be available for less than 18 months.
Five candidate vaccines were in Phase I safety trials in April.

As announced in April, the urgent priorities for the implementation of the new crisis-specific plan of CEPI are speed, production capacity, large-scale supply, and global reach.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological innovations were under research and development to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19 by early 2020.
The main focuses of the forum to promote the safety study of the I Level include:
Nucleic Acids (DNA and RNA) (grade I preparative and vaccine candidate: modern, mRNA-1273)
Viral bacteria (product of round I and candidate vaccine: Carcinobiologics, adenovirus type 5 bacteria)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 candidate vaccines are in pre-production, 78 have been accepted as a vigilance project (according to the Milken Institute, 79), and 37 more have been announced, but very little public information remains (between plans and design).
Phase I-II trials on safety and toxicity testing, including mixtures, placebo-controlled, and in a variety of settings, will be conducted to determine the most accurate and appropriate dosage.
Phase III trials include screening for strains, additional participants, control groups, and adverse effects at the appropriate dose, including evaluation of the immunity of the vaccine.

A few treatments have multiple side effects, also known as undetectable side effects.
This may also be beneficial in preventing disease.
In Australia, a detailed trial is being planned involving 4,170 healthcare workers.
The vaccines being developed are either not reliable or not efficient.
Preliminary studies to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines from animal models of COVID-19-specific strains such as ACE-2 strain rodents, other laboratory animals, and non-human primates suggest global collaboration to ensure biosecurity-friendly 3 control measures and safety procedures are maintained at their appropriate levels.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no vaccine that has been proven to be safe and effective in curing or preventing SARS.
According to published research papers from 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and treatments for SARS is a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
At the time of the MERS outbreak, it was hoped that the previous SARS study would provide important groundwork for the development of vaccines and therapeutic approaches to cure MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, the MERS vaccine (DNA-based) has passed all phase I human clinical trials, and others are underway, with all viral carriers, two adenoviral carriers (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-carrier (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts claim that the virus behind COVID-19 is known and a vaccine has already been found, and that the results of the research are complete.
Many cited social media sources have suggested gene sequencing and other vaccines for coronavirus infections such as SARS.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the severe symptoms of the deadly coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include burning, coughing, and wheezing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, pain in the wrist, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and heartburn.
The incubation period is about five days, but it can also be anywhere from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases are identified at the onset of symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ damage.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases and more than 153,000 deaths have been reported in 210 countries and territories.
More than 568,000 people have been cured of the virus, which is spread by contact with other people, often through coughing, sneezing, or talking.
While these moths exhale, they usually stick to the ground or to objects rather than reaching people at a distance.
People can contract the disease by touching contaminated objects, then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
Viruses can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
Symptoms are more transmissible in the first three days, although symptoms may be transmitted before and in the later stages of the disease.The most common method of symptom analysis is by retrospective retrospective analysis (rRT-PCR) of the enzyme-containing signals from the pancreas to the placenta during the course of the test.
The use of mouth and nose masks is recommended for people who suspect they have the virus and for their caregivers.
The order for the use of the mask varies from one employer to another, with some authorities prohibiting the use of the mask and others prohibiting the use of the mask.
Currently, there is no vaccine or treatment for COVID-19.
Outbreaks of the disease have been detected in more than half of the five WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may not show symptoms or may show symptoms such as flu and nausea, coughing, feeling tired, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, pain or tingling in the chest, dizziness, difficulty walking and blackening of the face or nails; if these symptoms persist, immediate medical attention is recommended.
In rare cases, respiratory symptoms such as coughing, runny nose, or a sore throat may occur.
Symptoms of back and chest pain such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are found on various parsnips.
A few patients in China initially had only a heart attack and a stroke.
In the gut, the disease can spread to the tuberculosis, to the organ failure, and to death.
This is when the disease is not present.
The incubation period for COVID-19 symptoms is usually five to six days, but is likely to be between two and 14 days.
97.5 percent of those with symptoms show symptoms within 11.5 days of infection.Reports show that not all infected individuals show symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic individuals in transmitting the disease is not yet fully understood, but insufficient evidence suggests that they may have played a role in transmitting the disease.
The status of those infected with the virus has not been determined, but the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of those infected do not show symptoms during their stay in hospital.
According to the National Health Commission of China, 130 out of 166 patients, including those who were asymptomatic on 1 April, were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The spider and the caterpillar can also carry a large amount of virus.
Speaking out loud may reveal a greater urgency than speaking slowly.
According to a study in Singapore, coughing without covering your mouth can cause the mucus to travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) from your body.
Although the virus is not entirely airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggests that it can be transmitted by bioresolutions, so respirators should be kept away from human organs.
Some procedures, such as catheterization and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), allow the fluid to flow through the air, causing it to be blown away.
The risk is believed to be low when it is suspected that the body's waste is transmitted.The virus is highly transmissible when infected people have passed the symptomatic stage; transmission is normal even if they do not show symptoms, but the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although the disease is easily transmitted and the full extent of its transmission is not clear, one person can infect an average of one to two people.The virus can persist on the body for several hours to several days.
It is particularly durable on wood for one day, plastic (polypropylene) and steel (AISI 304) for three days, and 99% copper materials for four hours.
However, this may vary depending on the type of swimming and physical activity.
When used properly, soaps and detergents are effective; the soap product reduces the virus's spread, softening, and removing skin and other tissue.
Other solutions such as benzoiconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a solvent) have lower efficacy.In a study in Hong Kong, the vaccine was given within two days of arrival at the hospital.
Five of the six patients, the first group showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in three pneumonia patients with respiratory illness in Wuhan.
The characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 are found naturally in the closely related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, destroying its immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is first introduced to SARS-CoV.
The virus is highly susceptible to COVID-19 because the virus receives the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is critical in the lung.
The virus is able to enter the cell by attaching to ACE2 using a different glycoprotein, known as a pepelomer.
12% of patients at Wuhan Hospital, China, have a severe heart attack, which is common in patients with advanced disease.
The human body is highly sensitive to irritation and the immune system is disrupted during the progression of the disease, which is why it is more likely to show cardiovascular symptoms, but severe heart attacks are associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are expressed in the heart, but not in the heart.
The higher risk of thrombosis (31%) and thromboembolism (25%) in patients receiving special care may be due to the presence of COVID-19-related infections and the opposite estimate.
Despite the presence of ACE2 for SARS-COV-2, many people infected with COVID-19 show symptoms of hyperenphylaemia.
In particular, pathogenic T-cells, which produce GM-CSF, have been shown to correlate with selection of IL-6-producing aggressive monocytes and with the symptoms of acute pneumonia seen in COVID-19 patients.
Even the introduction of white blood cells into the urine has been reported in autopsy.
WHO has developed several diagnostic procedures for the disease.
The accepted method of assaying the enzyme is by retrospective expression of the enzyme during its reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is performed separately with nasal breathing, but a nasal swab or a nasal urine sample may be used.
Fruit is harvested in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples, which need to be taken two weeks apart, have less immediate results.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify a single strain of coronavirus and sequentially copy its genes to allow laboratories around the world to develop their own PRC tests to detect the virus infection.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which detect new infections and detect whether a person has been infected before) were being developed, but have not yet been widely discussed.
Chinese research has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Federal Drug Administration on March 21, 2020, confirmed the first clinical trial to be operational by the end of the month.The authors of the clinical trial released by the Zongnan University Hospital in Wuhan suggested that the detection of disease characteristics and risks and transmission of disease could be used as a means of detecting infection.
The distribution of multibolar double-surfaces and of the essential elements in parallel is the primary cause of contamination.
It can be covered by pneumonia, exposed to a malignant tumor (alveolar sputum), and manifested as the disease progresses.
On certain days, there may be a small number of cases and transmission of COVID-19.
A recent study of the dead has found the following:
Microscopy: detection of lung fluid, pulmonary stimulation and the spread of the lung.
Four types of acute pneumonia virus have been identified:
Mild pneumonia: after bleeding, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, large pneumocytes, formation of a tumor in the tissue and the formation of an extremely large multi-nucleated cell.
Malignant pneumonia: a disseminated infection of the small intestine (DAD) with a diffuse airway pathway.
ADD is caused by symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and poor oxygenation in the blood.
Pulmonary pneumonia: a condition of the heart's inner ear and the inner ear
Blood: blood spatter in the vein (DIC); leukocyte retroblast reaction
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 f seconds, exercising proper breathing habits, and avoiding touching our eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
CDC says we stop covering our hands and mouths with a handkerchief when coughing and sneezing.
Careful hand hygiene is essential after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC mandates that face coverings be worn in crowded areas to prevent transmission from people without symptoms.The move is aimed at reducing conflict between the infected and the health community by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and reducing public gatherings.
Guidelines include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 meters).
There is no known effective vaccine against COVID-19. One of the keys to controlling COVID-19 is to try to reduce the spread of the outbreak, which could spread further.
In addition, the CDC recommends that individuals wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hand dirt is easily exposed, before eating and after flushing, coughing or sneezing.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer, with at least 60% alcohol content, is recommended, but this is only if soap and water are not available.In places where hand sanitizers are not readily available for sale, the World Health Organization offers two locally produced sizes of hand sanitizer.
In this formula, the antimicrobial agents are derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is useful for killing bacterial cells in alcohol but not a good detergent for cleaning the hands of bacteria.
Glycerol was added to make the liquid more refreshing.
People are provided with first aid care such as fluid therapy, oxygen assistance, and other first aid.
The CDC advises people who suspect they may be infected to wear a small mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is useful for managing respiratory fatigue, but its effectiveness is still under review.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and a diet are recommended to increase immunity.
A gentle treatment is useful for those who have symptoms of SARS in the early stages of the disease.The World Health Organization and the Chinese Health Commission have developed options for treating people with COVID-19.
U.S. pulmonologists have prepared an open-source IBCC trial from several institutions.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some doctors recommend that ibuprofen be replaced by paracetamol (acetaminophen) for the first time.
To reduce the spread of the virus, precautions should be taken, especially in healthcare systems when carrying out respiratory procedures.
For health care providers treating people with COVID-19, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) advises that in addition to the usual self-protection, contact and airborne self-protection measures, the person should be kept in the Airborne Infection Isolation Unit (AIIR).The CDC has outlined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment during this pandemic.
Recommended bodywear: PPE clothing, respirators or face masks, hand covers, and if available, a more breathable mask.
N95 respirators are out of production, but FDA has approved them for use under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Airborne disease-prevention systems also make it easier to use a biological counterpart.
When masks are not available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing a face mask or, as a last resort, a homemade mask.
Most COVID-19 cases are severe and do not require manual ventilation or other options, but some percent do.
Intensive clinical trials were conducted on hospitalized patients to help identify the respiratory syndrome that is most common in people with COVID-19 and which causes severe nasal transmission and respiratory tract infection, leaving some evidence to the contrary.
Whether the two treatments have the same effect on the majority of patients is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stick with a respirator because this method reduces the dispersion of small airways than a nasal tube.The patients who are currently in this condition are older adults (over 60 years old, and especially over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which means health facilities are not able to accommodate the high number of COVID-19 cases requiring hospital treatment due to the ongoing disease.
A study in China found that 5% of people who enter the emergency room, 2.3% who need assistance with respiratory systems, 1.4% die.
In China, about 30% of people with COVID-19 who are hospitalized end up in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Respiratory systems are becoming more complex and oxygen delivery is becoming more difficult as the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 are exacerbated.
Ventilators with high PEEP and controlled airflow are essential to increase oxygen supply and reduce the damage and buildup of pneumonia associated with ventilation hazards.
There is no PEEP in old ventilators.
Promising drug trials were launched in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are being tested on patients.
Remdesivir seems to have the best prospects.
Although the development of new drugs should be delayed until 2021, many of the drugs under trial are either approved for other uses or are already undergoing clinical trials.
Antiviral drugs can be used to treat patients with advanced disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended that willing individuals participate in the clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the drug.The Federal Medicines Administration has granted temporary authorization for the use of plasma transfusion as a surgical treatment for patients with life-threatening or acute injuries.
Clinical studies have not proven its usefulness.
In February 2020, China stopped mobile phone mosaics to investigate the cause of the disease.
Users were asked to enter their name and identity number (ID).
The app uses surveillance data to identify contacts and vulnerabilities.
One user can check the status of three other users.
If a critical condition is detected, the app not only tells people to isolate themselves, but also notifies local health officials.Call scanning, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and artificial intelligence are useful for identifying infected people and those who have contacted them in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track people infected with the coronavirus on mobile phones.
The penalty is to influence the timing of quarantine and to prevent contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared evidence of a collaborative call center with the Robert Koch Foundation, a German federal government agency for investigating and preventing the spread of the virus.
Rashan has deployed facial recognition technology to identify those who violate quarantine laws.
Italy's regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said 40% of the population was still active, according to mobile phone operators.
Germany held a 48-hour race on Saturday and Sunday, with 42,000 participants.
Also, the President of Estonia, Kerstin Kaljulaid, called for the world to seek new solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals deserve to suffer from isolation, travel restrictions, adverse health effects or fear of contamination.
The BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying that social distancing, isolation, health pollution, bullying and economic misunderstanding can have a negative impact on human mental health.
The condition may be mild with few or no symptoms, similar to common respiratory disorders, such as coughing.
Those with mild symptoms recover in two weeks, while those with severe symptoms may take three to six weeks.
The same virus data is used to detect the presence of COVID-19 in pregnant women, but the data on COVID-19 is less, and COVID-19 infection can cause pneumonia.
In patients with severe cases of COVID-19, the respiratory system is blocked and other organs can be affected, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Confusion over COVID-19 is increasing with sepsis, heart failure, kidney and liver failure.
Six percent of COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital had irregular blood clots, especially when they had high levels of proteomers, and four percent of the group had impaired renal function.
An estimated 20 to 30 percent of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, of which five days are spent in the hospital.
However, patients who are admitted to the ICU have an average of seven days between hospital admission and death.
In early-stage patient studies, the mean time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total duration of six to 41 days.
A study by the National Health Commission (NHC) shows that in China, 2.8% of men and 1.7% of women die.
Histopatological analysis of the dead lung showed that the spread of pneumonia in both lungs was significant.
A cytopathic mutation was found in the nematode virus.
The picture looked like an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China were due to heart attacks, troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to data from March in the United States, 89% of hospitalizations have normal symptoms, and the number of deaths depends on the availability of medical equipment and the economy of the country.
Estimates of mortality vary by region, and the severity of the mechanism may be a factor.
Underestimating the current prevalence of diseases can lead to overestimating the mortality rate.
However, the fact that human deaths were caused by infection in the past means that the rate of deaths is currently underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms than nonsmokers, and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die than nonsmokers.
Hong Kong hospital officials found a 20% to 30% decrease in the number of pneumonia cases in recovered patients.
After recovery, this can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder.
As of March 2020, there is no known cure for immunity and longevity.
Medium is based on the characteristics of the coronavirus, but people who recovered from COVID-19 are still reported to have tested positive.
It is believed that in these cases, it is worse to stop the disease than to catch it again.
The virus is thought to be natural and to have originated from animals.
The exact source is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the contamination was almost universally predictable.
A study of 41 COVID-19 patients published in January 2020 estimated the date of first symptom onset to be 1 December 2019.
The first WHO report was published on 8th May 2019.
Several measures are taken to report the death toll.
This number depends on country, time and extent of testing, quality of healthcare system, treatment options, age, gender and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed emergency deaths from SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for laboratory-confirmed uncommon deaths from COVID-19 infection.The mortality ratio is a measure of the number of deaths over a given period of time from the same distance between patients to the number of people with symptoms.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the death rate of patients as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of people with symptoms who die, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of people with symptoms who die without symptoms.
This information is not based on time and is not limited to a specific population.
Even if not all infected people develop immune proteins, the presence of these proteins should provide information about the number of infected people.
At the height of the outbreak in Italy, 80 people (1.7%) died in the small town of Castillone di Cultura, which has a population of 4600.
In Gangelet, the disease spread during the carnival festival and spread to young people, causing a decline in deaths, and all COVID-19 deaths may have been diagnosed as such.
The German health system is not overwhelming.
In the Netherlands, an estimated 3% of blood donors have antibodies.
69 (0.004 percent of the total population) confirmed deaths from COVID-19.
The severity and severity of the outbreak varies from male to female.
Men's mortality was the leading cause in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is to live to the age of 50, whereas the difference between male and female births will disappear by the age of 90.
In China, the male mortality rate is 2.8 percent and the female mortality rate is 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of this difference in cornea is unknown, but genetic and behavioral differences may be a factor.
Gender inequality, lower smoking rates among women, and men's more aggressive behaviour in adolescence than women's have led to higher mortality rates among men than women.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died of COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government has not detected any cases of sexually transmitted COVID-19 infection.
Studies show that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS have different effects on men and women.
Many health workers, including nurses, are women, and therefore at higher risk of disease.
"The official name of the disease will be ""COVID-19"" as determined by the World Health Organization on February 11, 2020".
According to WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, COVID-19 will replace corona, HIV will replace virus, DN will replace disease, and 19 will replace the outbreak, which occurred on 31st 2019.
The name was chosen to prevent stigmatisation by using international mating techniques to prevent it from being identified in specific areas (e.g. China), animal species or human groups.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization uses the COVID-19 virus and the COVID-19-causing virus in public communications as well.
Both the virus and the disease are collectively referred to as coronaviruses.
When the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, the virus was known as Wuhan coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization proposed the names 2019-nCov and 2019-nCov Acute based on the 2015 calendar and based on the name and locality.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were abolished on February 11, 2020.
Due to the power constraints in the supply system, some digital manufacturing companies are producing medical devices such as nasal sanitizers and ventilators.
In one example, when a hospital in Italy was in urgent need of ventilator valves and could not supply them in time, a local factory tested the valves from another factory and produced 100 needed valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, the measures to control, contain, contain, contain, treat and other aspects of the disease and its spread were rapid.
It has been suggested that humans could also transmit the disease to other animals.
The study found no evidence of virus replication in pigs, chickens and chickens.
There is no known cure or cure for the disease.
International studies on COVID-19 vaccines and treatments are being conducted by government agencies, expert groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the TQUMMA trial to evaluate the results of the existing antiviral drugs, which are expected to be highly effective.
There is no known cure, but many companies are working on a vaccine.
Previous studies on SARS-CoV are still being debated, as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 enter human cells via their ACE2 receptor.
Three vaccines are being studied.
Initially, researchers planned to develop a complete vaccine against the virus.
The use of the virus, whether it is weak or deadly, focuses on eliminating the body's early immune response to new infections of COVID-19.
The second approach is to develop stem cells, which allow the immune system to detect the virus's own stem cells.
In SARS-CoV-2, such studies focus on the S-spike protein, which allows the virus to enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is nucleic acid vaccination (DNA and RNA vaccination, the first method of creating a vaccine).
Human-based trials of vaccines derived from these methods must be tested for safety and efficacy reasons.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine was launched in Seattle on four volunteer participants.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code derived from the virus that causes the disease.The evolution of the natural antibody-based vaccine for SARS-COV-2 is considered to be highly effective.However, this is disputed.
As of April 2020, more than 300 clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials, including four tests on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, were against the most widely accepted malaria drugs.
Most Chinese trials will focus on re-engineering the antiviral drug for other purposes, with nine Phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries following the final report in April.
The development of a vaccine and a drug for COVID-19 is in clinical development.As of April 2020, existing antiviral drugs such as remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir interferon are being studied in combination with other antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.
There is unconfirmed evidence that Remdesivir submitted in March 2020.
Signs of improvement have been reported in patients who have taken remdesivir.
The third clinical trial was conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria, was first studied in China in February 2020.
On the other hand, there is a call for research.
Health authorities in Korea and China have reported the effectiveness of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology warns that while it recommends daily doses of up to one gram, there is a risk of serious or even fatal doses of up to two times that amount.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA will seek approval for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also uses interferon, ribavirin or iminefenovir for the prevention of COVID-19.
Data from the review suggested that the overuse of ribavirin actually led to the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the study.
Natasozanide is also prescribed for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have shown that the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) receptor is a receptor for ACE2 in the initiation of SARS-CoV-2.
Cloroquine and hydrochlorquine trials with or without azithromycin have significant problems, which have prevented them from being accepted as a drug by the medical community without further investigation.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in the virus, and is not known to play a role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm may be a further extension of the current late stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydrochloride may have anti-cytokine properties.Toclizumab has been added to the clinical guidelines of the Chinese National Health Commission after a modest study.
A second phase of a nationwide trial is underway in Italy after a critically ill patient showed symptoms.
Tests of blood plasma ferritin in combination with the test substance can be used to detect cytokines, which means that it prevents a process that is thought to kill some patients.
The receptor for interleukin-6 was approved by the FDA in a clinical study of the pre-symptomatic form of the cytokine-induced CAR T cell in 2017.
There is currently no clinical evidence that tolliczumab is effective for CRS.
The use of antibodies, which are collected and distributed from people who have recovered from COVID-19, is being studied as a cell-degraded immunity method.
The technique has had unfinished results but has been tested for SARS.
Virus elimination is a mechanism by which immunotherapy is coordinated with SARS-CoV-2 antibody therapy.
However, other mechanisms such as immuno-dependent cell degradation, cytotoxicity and phagocytosis are possible.
Alternative antibody treatments, such as factory-made monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Serum chloride, which is a blood plasma of improved patients and contains proteins that globally inhibit the virus, could be increased in production for emergency deployment.
Coronavirus infections, a group of symptoms
Li Wenliang, a medical doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, died after contracting COVID-19 after raising awareness about the spread of the virus.
