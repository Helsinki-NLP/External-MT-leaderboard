Members of Parliament in Wales are afraid to look like pimps
Some MPs were alarmed by the proposal that their title would change from AMs to MWPs (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern was raised following plans to change the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of parliament from all political quarters are concerned that this will be a laughing matter.
One Labour MP said his people feared it would go against the TWP and the PWP.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means pussy.
A member of parliament from the PLA Camry party said all his members were "not happy" and offered alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his members were open to proposals for a name change, but noted that the name MWP (the initials of the Welsh MP) sounded very similar to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh w is pronounced similarly to the English u in the Yorkshire accent.
The House Committee on Legislation, which is currently drafting the legislation for the name changes, said: "The final decision on any descriptive words regarding the names of the positions of the members of the House of Representatives is, of course, the decision of the members of the House of Representatives themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh House of Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which gave broad support to changing the name of the legislature to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title role of Members of Parliament (AMs), the committee recommended Welsh MPs or box heads WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in public consultation.
Members of parliament are offering alternatives, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause a bit of pain for committee chair Ellen Jones, who is expected to table a draft legislation on the changes in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way the legislature works, including rules for removing MPs and the structure of the committee system.
The vote of MPs is what will ultimately determine the title of their role during the legislative debate.
Macedonians are going to the polls with a referendum on changing the country's name
Citizens will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was set in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Greece has long argued that its northern neighbourhood is a barrier claiming Greek territory and has opposed Macedonia's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who opposed the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results.
However, those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent in the face of the difficulties of churches in Harlem.
According to Mr. Adams, the old residents of the neighborhood say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner.
Today there are no bars or churches".
He said you can understand Bream's disappearance.
People's social lives today are different, note.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living room where people visit on a regular basis".
As for the churches, he's worried that the money from property sales won't last as long as the church leaders expect, and sooner or later, they'll find themselves back where they started".
He said that the churches would be replaced by apartment buildings with communal housing that are not the kind that would help the neighborhoods maintain their unique character.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people", he said, "so this will force the closure of these churches, because it's unlikely that most people who move into these apartments will join these churches".
Both churches were built by white believing communities, before Harlem became a predominantly black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
A black believing community that operated in the area became the owners of the building.
St. Martin's Church passed to a black congregation under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a central shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 caused heavy damage to the structure, but as part of the believers' plans under Reverend Johnson to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction of the Bell Crane.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson Sr. and heir to his seat at St. Martin's, proudly called the choir "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another name: "Cultural treasure" and "unreplaceable historical artifact".
The expert, Tiffany Ing of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first bell chime in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who later played the larger chime at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Marivoth said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
What has happened at St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by local church leaders, others by Episcopal bishops.
The Assembly - the governing body of the community of believers made up of local believers - wrote to the bishops in July expressing its concerns that the bishops would try to roll over the costs to the Assembly, even though the Assembly was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the bishops.
Some of the faithful complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
A shark wounds a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he was diving to catch lobsters in California on the first day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in the Ancinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been shoveling with friends since about 1 a.m. on Saturday morning, when he heard the boy screaming for help and then sneaked in with a team to help get him to shore.
The emperor thought at first it was just the enthusiastic shouts of the lobster catch, but then he realized that the boy was screaming "I'm bitten!"
I got bit!
The Hamel said that when he approached the boy, he saw that his entire hyoid bone was broken.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'", added Hamel.
The boy was flown to Rudy Hospital in San Diego where he's listed as human.
It's not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue commander Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been identified in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined not to be a dangerous predator shark.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Authorities have closed access to the beach from Punto Beach in Casbalda to Swami Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to penetrate the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's starts out in competition with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and opens dog-shop-style crossings with professional saleswomen.
As part of a major push to penetrate the UK's £2.8 billion-a-year beauty market, which continues to grow as sales in the fashion and home goods sectors decline, expanded transfers of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added to additional stores next year.
The investment in beauty products comes as retailers look for ways to use shelf space previously captured by TVs, microwave ovens and home products.
Sainsbury's said the company is expected to double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time in its history.
Existing product lines from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also gain additional space with dedicated brand areas similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The chain has also relaunched its boutique line of makeup products, so that most of the products are environmentally friendly, a feature that is growing in demand among younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop chain will be looking at franchises at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Slea Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and beyond buying smaller amounts of food every day at local convenience stores requires grocery stores to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will become more like dog shops as the supermarket chain tries to fight off the cheap chains Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has added Argos outlets in hundreds of stores as well as a number of Habitat outlets since acquiring both chains two years ago, additions that she said have boosted grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
Previous attempts by the network to revive its beauty and pharmacy divisions have failed.
Sainsbury's attempted a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how to split profits from the pharmacy into supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds chain of pharmacies for £125 million three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play a role in the plan, by expanding the brand's offerings of luxury skincare products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, said: "We've transformed the look and feel of our beauty products, to improve the environment for customers.
We also invested in highly trained staff who would be available to provide on-site counseling.
Our brand offerings are tailored to suit every need and our attractive environment and convenient locations make us an attractive destination for beauty shopping, challenging the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willaby cancels an £11 million deal
The star of the television show Dragons Den, Peter Jones, expressed outrage after the television presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Truth be told, Villaby doesn't have time for their own brand of housewares and accessories.
The two's joint venture is considered to be similar to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure in an Instagram post.
Holly Willaby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones boiling with anger by canceling her last-minute stint with the latter's prestigious lifestyle brand - to focus on her fat contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was angry when the TV star announced during a heated meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to her new deals - worth up to £1.5 - she did not have enough time left to dedicate to their housewares and accessories brand Truly.
The two's joint venture was considered to be similar to actress Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double Willaby's fortune, estimated at £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willaby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones was on a flight from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to one of the sources, "Truly was undoubtedly Hooli's top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future that would provide income for the next decades.
His decision to leave completely surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to being drunk.
The company's warehouses in Marlow are full of ready-to-sell products".
Experts believe that the departure of This Morning, one of the UK's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to massive investments in a variety of products, from pillows and torches to household clothing, and the potential for further delay in launch.
And that could end a long friendship.
Willaby, who is a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willaby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined the company's board in March.
The couple were on vacation together and Jones owns 40 percent of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willaby will become the M&S brand ambassador and replace Annette McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We're not commenting on his business affairs".
♪ Hard talk ♪ ♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he's getting from the news media for statements that some would label as "unpresidential" and that he's so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Said Trump in a newscaster's voice.
"I made no compromises".
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after praising their first meeting in June as a major step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the negotiations on disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong-ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea sees no "responsive" response from the United States to the initial disarmament steps taken by North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing sanctions designed to continue the pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his speech to the convention.
"We're in a great position with North Korea", he said.
"We almost went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
We have a great relationship now".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the cessation of missile tests, aid to the release of prisoners and the return of the remains of American soldiers home.
And he defended his extraordinary approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded stadium, we had about 200 people standing there", Trump said, casting his vote directly in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lombok population lost their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for mobilizing international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they've been very clear that they're not asking for international help, so it's a bit challenging", Ms. Sombong said.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palo, it is not yet clear if foreign envoys will be allowed to pass through the area.
Mr. Sotopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said that the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palo to see if more international services can contribute to the relief effort.
With earthquakes continuing to occur in Indonesia, the country remains unfortunately ill-prepared for natural disasters.
While tsunami waves have been built in Oche County, they are rare in other coastal areas.
The lack of clear tsunami warnings in Palo, although there was a warning, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of times, traveling between Indonesia's many islands is challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that anchored in Lombok to treat earthquake survivors is making its way to Palo, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was at the heart of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he invested heavily in roads and railways.
But Mr. Goku is facing funding shortfalls as he prepares to run for re-election next year.
Mr. Goku also faces the pressures of ongoing class tensions in Indonesia as a result of the religious radicalization process of the country's Muslim majority.
Over 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs - using knives, bows, arrows and other domestic weapons.
Video: Daniel Stridge of Liverpool equals Chelsea in the last minute
Daniel Stridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Stridge got a pass from Shrevehan Shakir when he was 30 yards from Chelsea's goal and his team was down 1-0.
He bounced the ball to his left and then turned the kick into the far corral.
The ball flew high above the net and landed towards the top right corner of the net.
Eventually the ball landed over the goalkeeper, Kafka Arisbelga, who leapt in his direction, and fell into the net.
I was just trying to get to this position, to get to the ball and players like Shak always play as far forward as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible", Surridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I made one touch and didn't think about it too much and I just kicked".
Chelsea led 0-1 at half time after Belgian star Aden Azar scored in the 25th minute.
The Blue forward passed a pass back to Matthew Kovacic that same game, before turning near the middle of the field and running fast into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic performed a fast-paced maneuver in the middle of the field.
Then he kicked a beautiful cross kick, which led the ace into the open.
The ace ran ahead of the defence and finished with the ball in the top right corner of the goal, with a left kick that passed Liverpool player Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League home leg on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videotape in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude quake that struck on Friday and caused waves as high as 6 meters, agency spokesman Sotofo Porovo Niroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palo, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was covered in the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
Police have opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Beaconhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am in the John Street area with her body stabbed, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling people in the area who saw or heard anything to contact her.
Detective Superintendent Brian O'Hagan has just said, "The investigation is in progress, but I would like to urge anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I also want to ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have captured something on a vehicle camera to come forward - because the footage may contain information that is vital to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
Friends who believe they knew the woman came to the scene this afternoon to ask questions about where she was this morning.
Investigations are continuing as police say they are in the process of delivering messages to the families.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews just tried to get into his apartment, but he was told that police are prohibiting anyone from entering or leaving the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will be hours before they can return to their apartments.
A cop is heard telling one person that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
A woman was seen at the scene crying.
She keeps coming back and mumble, "This is terrible".
At 2:00 p.m. two police vans were spotted inside the arena and another one outside.
Several officers were stationed inside the scene as they targeted people in the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message on Twitter to @MerPolCC, type 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 and indicate the diary number 247 as of September 30.
Cromwell's statue of Parliament became the next target for attacks on memorials in the struggle for the writing of history.
Removing the statue would be poetic justice in light of the Taliban's puritanical removal of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England.
But the Cromwell Society argues that Mr Crick's proposal is foolish and attempts to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that in the current controversy over the removal of statues, the figure of Oliver Cromwell standing outside the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The carving of the English Civil Wars was not commissioned by Cromwell nor was it done by him.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell fell victim to the actions of one of his predecessors in the dynasty, Thomas Cromwell, a century ago.
The impressive representation of Cromwell in the hands of the sculptor Sir William Hammo Thorncroft is a testament to the 19th-century view and part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was perceived by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as the one who defended Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate estimate is a subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is an indisputable fact that the struggle in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation later on, and Cromwell is one recognizable figure who represents one side of the spectrum at that time.
His achievements as Protector Lord are also worthy of honor and praise.
A deadly pig drives a Chinese farmer to his death
Local media sources report a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified by family name Xuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery while covered in blood near a pigsty in the Loopenshui market in the province of Guizhou, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer prepares to inject vaccines into a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He reportedly traveled on Wednesday with a cousin from neighboring Yunnan Province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next day, his cousin found him dead, and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the house there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
Forensic investigation has confirmed that the 250-pound pig attacked the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My uncle's feet were covered in blood and they were soaking", said his cousin, whose family name is Wu, as quoted in the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market Thursday morning at 4:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked behind a fence and smelled to prevent it from attacking more people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
It's been reported that negotiations are underway between Yuan's family and the market authorities regarding compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to sustain injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had strapped a Welsh farmer to his tractor until the farmer's wife ran the animal away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, one Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but the taste of blood may be a trigger.
They're just playing.
They're like naughty kids, very inquisitive... They don't mean to hurt you.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in large areas of the southwestern United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakened as it moved over the cooler waters of the northern Gulf Coast.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring flooding across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The winds of Hurricane Rosa have reached 135 Km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, and as of Sunday morning 5 a.m. eastern time, the center of the storm is 620 km southeast of Punta Eugina, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a storm is forming over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As it loosely approaches the California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push tropical moisture deep north into the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 millimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture that combines with the approaching high will produce heavy rainfall over large areas of the southwestern United States over the next few days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause flash floods and the risk of desert landslides.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall to reach 50 to 75 mm/h in various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 50 to 100 mm is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially in Arizona.
There may be flash floods with conditions deteriorating rapidly due to the scattered nature of the tropical rainfall.
It is highly recommended to avoid walking long distances in the desert when there is a danger of tropical rain.
Heavy rain could turn canyons into raging rivers and thunderstorms would bring strong winds and dust storms.
The approaching peak will bring local rainfall to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There could be total rainfall of over 13mm, which could cause debris to drift and roadways to break up.
It'll be the first rain in the area this rainy season.
Scattered tropical showers will begin to approach Arizona Sunday evening and Monday morning, with rainfall expected to intensify and spread through Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the four corners on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October, there may be sharp temperature changes across the United States, with the Arctic cooling but the tropics remaining fairly warm.
This sometimes leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a prime example of extreme temperature changes across the central United States.
There's a temperature difference of almost 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, a prolonged Keysian fever will try to develop and expand again.
In early October, temperatures will be warm in most of the central and eastern United States, ranging from 27 to 31 degrees Fahrenheit [27-31°C] from the southern plains to the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 5 degrees above average.
The long-term weather forecast shows a high chance of higher-than-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the hearing of Bert Kavanaugh
Over 20 million people watched Thursday, on six television networks, the compelling testimony of Supreme Court nominee Burt Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s, Christine Blazy Ford.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continues, with flashes of news in the middle of the regular broadcasts to announce a surprising development on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI will conduct a week-long investigation to test the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Quanno touched her body while drunk and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kawano, in a mixed testimony, said he was 100% sure it didn't happen.
The number of viewers was probably even higher than the reported 20.4 million Nielsen ratings.
Nielsen has tested the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Van Nelsen usually has a hard time measuring people watching in offices.
By comparison, this is a viewing audience on a scale similar to a football playoff or an Oscar ceremony.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose commentators are enthusiastic supporters of Kavanaugh's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to the Nielsen report.
Interest levels remained high after the hearing.
Senator Flake was the central figure in the drama that unfolded on Friday.
After the moderate Republican senator's office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh's nomination, he was photographed by CNN and CBS cameramen as a group of protesters shouted at him as he tried to get into the elevator to get to a Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with a humiliated gaze for several minutes as the protests raged, all of which was captured live on CNN.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the nation?
He was told, "You have power while so many women are helpless".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying, before the elevator door closed, he would say more at the committee hearing.
All the networks and cables were live-streaming a few hours later, as the Judiciary Committee was about to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would vote for the nomination only on the condition that there is an understanding that the FBI will investigate the allegations against the nominee within the next week, which is what the Democratic minority members have demanded.
Flake is partially convinced by conversations he's had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Cons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had power, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have a majority to approve Quanno's appointment without an inquiry.
President Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused her critics of playing politics on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused her EU exit reviewers of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the nation's internet, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that appeared alongside her idea on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson continued to attack her Brexit "scam" plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU back each other's tariffs was "completely absurd".
Police have arrested Deaton Simpson as a suspect in the murder of LSU football player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for LSU.
A 20-year-old man named Ditton Simpson has been arrested and jailed for first-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department has learned.
Officials released footage of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they contained Simpson's DNA, according to a report from WAFB, which is part of CBS.
After Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wade to death.
Bail was set at $350,000, as reported in the Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Pathology Institute released a preliminary report Friday, stating the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
Police gave credit to the mission force to capture fugitive criminals at the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens who assisted in the investigation that led to the suspect's capture.
LSU athletic director Joe Alva thanked local law enforcement for "their bravery and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-7 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, played basketball at LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked and appalled" by Wade's death.
"That's what you're afraid of all the time", Wade said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican residents on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity at the crater increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
Downtown has been buzzing and shaking.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the sunsets of cars in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity at the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Gyo, has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces to disperse the demonstrations, and thousands more joined protests against the first anniversary of the party's vote for Catalan independence.
A group of masked protesters who were stopped by police to disperse the demonstrations, throwing eggs at the police and spraying paint, creating black dust clouds on the streets that usually crowd tourists.
Clashes also broke out later that day when police were forced to use force to overcome the protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups stood singing "Never Forgotten, Never Forgiven" against the pro-unity supporters who chanted "Life of Spain".
Local media reported that 14 people were treated for minor injuries sustained by the protesters.
Tensions remain high in pro-independence areas a year after the referendum held on 1 October was declared illegal by the Spanish government but celebrated by pro-independence Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become an independent state, although the turnout was low as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the vote.
Government authorities in Catalonia reported that nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent ballot boxes from being held across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups set up overnight camps on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held but had to be conducted on a different track.
Narcisse Thermes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had lost hope about Catalonia's chance of independence.
Last year was our best time.
I saw my parents crying for joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Although Catalan separatist parties won a significant, if humiliating, victory in elections last December, they have struggled to maintain momentum this year with many of their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in prison awaiting trial for their part in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Juan Fuge, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, said the clash was being monitored by politicians on both sides of the aisle.
"It's getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Yonkers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Standing as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the tyranny of democratic values and the repression we have witnessed from the Spanish government", he said.
A number of men were arrested after a car crashed into a house
Three men - aged 33, 34 and 39 - were arrested after a car crashed several times at a home in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Blenegård Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Detective Bob Blemings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point, an arrow was fired at the car.
A Manga kick gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal for Livingston guaranteed the win.
Livingston, who had just been promoted, stunned Rangers and manager Steven Gerrard, only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Aerobics.
Dolly Manga's kick was significant because Gary Holt's team moved up with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team remains undefeated away from home in the postseason, and will face the league's leading Hart, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extends their losing streak at home to six games, and head coach Holt hasn't had a break since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed chances against a weak host team.
Holt's team was supposed to be in the lead long before they got a goal, when their directness caused the Rangers various problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his attempts before goal, and then Alan Litwigg was able to focus his efforts only wide after slipping in to meet Craig Leggett's opening before goal.
The hosts were willing to let Ranger play ahead of them, knowing they could make it difficult for the host team with free kicks.
And that's how the decisive gate was set.
Rangers received a free kick and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined to block Mange, who made a touchdown and scored from the centre of the field.
At this point, the Rangers were dominating the ball but found the home defense impenetrable, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained almost unthreatened.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos did force Kelly to save the goal.
Scott Pittnam stopped Rangers goalie Alan McGregor and Lithgow from a wide touchdown with another free kick from Livingston.
Crossballs continued to enter the Livingston area and brake, while two penalty balls - after a pass of the catch on substitute Glenn Middleton, and one on reach - were removed.
- Amazing from Livingston. - Surgery.
The BBC Scotland at Tony McCroney Stadium
Amazing game and amazing score from Livingston.
All the players were excellent, and they kept on exceeding expectations with this upward momentum.
Their style of play and the strength of the players have hardly changed since their return to the lead, but Holt has much credit for the way he has shaped the team since his arrival.
He had so many stars.
Captain Holcutt was formidable, leading a wonderfully organised defence, while Mange kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on high alert all the way.
The Rangers were uninspired.
Although they were quite good at times under Gerard, they didn't live up to those standards.
They were missing the final ball -- they only opened the home team's defense once -- and that's a red light for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Mixed reception for Arduino in Cologne
There were smiles and blue skies as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast on Saturday in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which was aimed at fixing relations between the two NATO members.
They were divided on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
From there, Erdogan went on to attend the inauguration of a new huge mosque.
Cologne is the city with the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police declared security reasons for blocking a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their leader.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - also made their voices heard, protesting both Erdogan's policies and Germany's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protesting protesters reflect the controversy surrounding the guest, who is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and condemned by others as a heretic.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the junction of the Studewood and Evelyn roads, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city, at around 10:15 UK time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and paramedics treated the wounded, but the man died on the spot.
The collision came after another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childress Street, about a mile from the crash site on Saturday.
City police say officers are trying to identify the victim and notify his family.
Instead of parking barriers and buses being diverted to alternative routes, drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Latrine Prison: Six guards were injured in the riot
Six guards were injured in a riot at a maximum security prison for men, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at Long Latham Prison in West Riding on Sunday at around 0930 hours UK time, and is still ongoing.
Special officers from the Tornado Unit were brought in to put down the riot, which involved eight prisoners and a brake on one ward.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said, "Specially trained guards have been recruited to deal with an ongoing incident at Long Latrine Prison".
Six guards were treated for injuries.
We don't tolerate violence in our prisons, and we're clear that the suspects will be handed over to the police and their sentences may be extended.
Long Latrine Prison houses 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And last October, riot police were called to the prison to deal with a serious riot in which guards were attacked with snooker sticks.
Hurricane Rosa threatens flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It's rare for a tropical storm to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what's expected early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rose cross the southeastern desert and bring with them the threat of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has declared a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona into southeastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 10 tropical cyclones have remained in tropical storm or subtropical storm status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border".
Arizona Hurricane Center's latest models predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm on Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas in the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are expected to receive 25 to 50 mmHg, with the possibility of isolated sites receiving as much as 50 mmHg.
For those outside the flash flood risk area, the rain of Hurricane Rosa could be a blessing because the area has suffered drought.
Although flooding is a serious hazard, some of this rain will be helpful because the southwest region is currently suffering from the conditions of the form.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is in severe drought, the second-highest category, weather.com reports.
First, a path of Hurricane Rosa will make landfall across the peninsula in Northern California, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa, still hurricane-force Sunday morning with maximum sustained winds of 137 knots, is 620 km south of Punta Jujuana, Mexico, and moving north at about 20 knots.
The storm hit colder waters in the Pacific, so it weakened.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall across parts of Mexico could be heavy and pose a threat of severe flooding.
Overall rainfall is expected to be 75 to 150 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of up to 250 mm, weather.com reports.
Then, Storm Rosa will continue into Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then continue across Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The primary threat from Hurricane Rosa, or its remnants, is heavy rainfall in Baja California, southwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert, the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to cause flash floods and life-threatening waste streams in the desert, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Meadsamar Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Trace area of Midsomer Norton on Sunday at around 0400 hours UK time.
He was taken to the hospital where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock, Avon and Somerset area, according to the shuttle.
The police are asking anyone who might have cell phone footage of what happened to contact the police.
Trump said that Quano had suffered the condemnation and anger of the Democratic Party.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless spirit and shocking tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Quano had endured the condemnation, the anger of the Democratic Party throughout his entire nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blazy Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at her indictment hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance and quality and courage of Kawano that day.
"A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the finest legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service", he told his supporters in West Virginia.
The president has made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important votes of our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm actually a candidate, he said.
That's why I run everywhere to fight for great candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats were on a mission to resist and disrupt.
A senior Republican aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the full Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of deaths in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, and the number is rising
At least 384 people were killed, many of them swept away by huge waves crashing onto the shores, as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, official sources reported on Saturday.
Many people gathered for the beach festival in Palo on Friday, when waves carrying a height of 6 meters (18 feet) crushed the beach at sunset, sweeping many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still busy on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they were victims", said Sotopo Porvo Noroho, spokesman for BNPB, in a Jakarta briefing.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was pulling cars, logs, houses, it was hitting everything on the ground", Noruo said, adding that the tsunami had advanced over the open sea at 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed destruction of a large number of homes and shops, broken bridges and courses and a mosque surrounded by water.
Sub-earthquakes continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes has been felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Bureau of Technology Assessment and Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's powerful quake was 200 times greater than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
He said the city's geography, sitting on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Noroho described the destruction as "tremendous" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Norhoe said the death toll and damage could be greater along northern Palo with a 300 km (190 mi) coastline, an area called Dongla, and closer to the epicenter.
Communications are completely broken and there is no news from Dongla, Norho said.
The area is home to more than 300,000 people, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its people and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse, he said.
On Saturday, the agency was heavily criticized for not announcing that a tsunami had hit Palo, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man can be seen on the roof of a high-rise building shouting hysterical warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes on the beach, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the photo was authentic.
The quake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that shut down communications around Palo and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but survivors are still desperate for food and other essentials.
The city's airport is open for relief efforts only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the rescue centers in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's very difficult.
As World Vision people from Dongla arrived safely in Palo City, where workers are sheltered in brass shelters set up in their office courtyards, they passed through spectacles of destruction on their way, Mr. Duceba said.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed, he said.
It's very difficult.
Even as relief teams embarked on the unfortunate act of moving disaster relief gear, there were complaints that experienced foreign aid workers were prevented from reaching Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of funds, supplies and people from other countries can only begin if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
That's not done yet.
"It is still classified as a provincial-level disaster", said Ulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
After the government says, "Okay, this is a national disaster", we can open the door to international aid, but that status has not been announced.
As night fell for the second time in Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing held on in the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the bleak stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy slipped through the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days, with her mother's body by her side.
Gandon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paratroopers, trained two missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others among those trapped at the See See Hotel, including Mr. Mangi, were his students.
"A veteran of the parachute field, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Mr. Gandon recalled how in the hours after news of the fall of the See See Hotel spread among the expansion skydiving community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palo who were taking part in the beach festival.
But his messages showed only one gray check mark, instead of the two blue ones.
I think it means the messages weren't delivered, he said.
Thieves took $26,750 during a cash-filling at Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brynx employee who was filling out a cash register at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, investigative reporter Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man ran after a Brink's employee and stole a bag with money to be filled in an ATM.
A witness saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the report, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is requested to contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kenya West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The entity formerly known as Kenya West".
West, 41, has been fondly called Ye for a while and has used the moniker for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on the TV show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional name, West has said in the past that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible the word means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, when discussing the name of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
It went from "Kanye", which means one and only, to just "Ye" -- simply a reflection of the good in us, the bad in us, or the confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's one of a few famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as either Puff Daddy, Pappy Daddy or Didi, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brotherly Love.
West's former partner, Jay Z, also went through versions of his name with and without a cap and in bold.
The president of Mexico has pledged not to use the military against civilians.
Mexico's president-elect, Andres Manuel López Obrador, has pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square never to use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
Military forces opened fire on a nonviolent demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing some 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were beginning to develop throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial support to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people into criminal gangs.
The United States should double its funding for AI.
As China's AI activity increases, the United States should double the amount it invests in AI research, says AI researcher Kai-Fu Li, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His words come after various parts of the U.S. government released statements about AI, even as the U.S. government has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be number one in AI by 2030.
Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all the other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we're looking for the next breakthrough in AI, he told me.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI achievement happening in the U.S., he told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in China's most prominent artificial intelligence company, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the No. 1 ranked RB player in the U.S., and later served as a senior manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee was introduced to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects, and asked when the next line would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win government grants, he told me.
It's not China that's taking away our top academics, it's the corporations that are doing it, he told me.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have in recent years recruited stars from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the Arab countries to strengthen their efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think you should automatically offer green cards to those with a PhD in AI", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its next-generation AI development plan.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, I tell you.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, designed to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI initiative called AI Next.
And as for the NSF, it's currently spending over $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, a U.S. legislative initiative to create an AI national security committee has been dormant for months.
Macedonians vote in a poll with the question of whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change their name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move to resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has prevented them from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor's name is a Greek claim to territory and has vetoed its membership in NATO and the European Union.
The two countries signed a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will hurt the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Serb population.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the European Union with the agreement with Greece?"
Those who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, which is one of the states that formed from the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies like the European Union and NATO.
"I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live in freedom under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safe life for all of us", said Oliva Georgizbekha, 79, in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will follow the results of the vote to make it final.
To change the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no irregularities as of 1:00 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66% of the eligible voters turned out.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Josie Tanovsky, voting in the capital city of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son are casting their ballots in Stromica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, in a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will open the door to its accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardzkov set up a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by those boycotting the People's Choice.
"We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with a straight head, not through the entrance of the servants", said Kawarderkov.
We're a poor country, but we have respect.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian Union.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said a positive result would be a guarantee of our future.
A poll released Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma TV, found that 57 of the respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout needs to be at least 50 percent and one.
A failure of the poll would be the first significant loss of pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Video: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero, navigating through all of Brighton's defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling broke Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
It seemed that the Jaguar was taking the gate with ease.
The Argentine forward got a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before breaking into the open field.
At this point, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed around one shield before he ran into a few more shields on the Brighton wide border.
Then he kicked a left-handed pass, and found Sterling.
The Englishman used his first touch on the field to pass the ball back to Aguero, who kicked Brighton's goalkeeper, Matthew Ryan, with a ball to the right of the net.
Jaguaro is suffering from problems with his feet, Manchester City's management told reporters.
We agreed he'd play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he scored at that moment".
But it was Sterling who gave the Skycaps the opening lead in the Super League rivalry.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton's turf during this.
He sent a great pass across the right wing to Leroy Saña.
Sana drilled the ball before leading Sterling to the far corner.
Blue Sky pushed the ball into the net just before he skated off the field.
Manchester City will face the Fans in the Champions League play-off on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play Spoiler against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to force another start.
But the highly competitive Scherzer is hoping to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it still has playoff implications for the Rockies, who are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least earned an open-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they haven't yet secured first place at home.
"Even though we're playing for nothing, at least we can be able to play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the spectators and the other team will be playing at the highest level probably at every point I'm competing with you this year.
Why wouldn't I want to deal with it?"
The Nationals haven't announced the starter for Sunday, but reports are that they're inclined to let Scherzer pitch in this situation.
Scherzer, who will be his 34th start, has a bullpen practice on Thursday and will serve on his day off, Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a stop in West Virginia
The president indirectly alluded to the situation surrounding his nominee for Supreme Court justice Bert Kavanaugh, as he spoke of the importance of Republicans coming to vote in the midterm elections.
Everything we did was on the line in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
It's one of the most, most -- I'm not running, but I'm actually running, so I'm running everywhere and fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this terrible, terrible group of radical Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And if you are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the condemnations, the abuses.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, what they want is power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
The Democrats are, he said, on a mission to resist and disrupt.
And you've seen it over the last four days, he said, calling the Democrats angry and evil and ugly and dishonest.
He mentioned the minority leader on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which drew scorn from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Oh, uh, what.
No, oh no, I waited until -- that was really bad body language -- worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer a pluralistic place.
She's not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists at my local party branch voted to censor me, it wasn't exactly a surprise.
After all, I am the last in line of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome - and only because we have expressed our opinion.
My fellow MP, Joan Ryan, has earned that same treatment for taking a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the decision to censor me was a punishment for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe -- ironically, issues similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous party leaders.
The committee on the East Nottingham Labour Party meeting on Friday said that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the Friday night general committee meetings were just like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many of the meetings today and the promise of a kinder, gentler politics has long been forgotten, if ever started.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party has no tolerance for different views, and every opinion is judged on its acceptance by the party leadership.
This situation started shortly after Jeremy was elected party leader, when colleagues who I thought shared the same political views began to expect him to turn around and take positions that I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether it was on national security or on a single European market.
Every time I speak in public -- and it doesn't really matter what I say -- there's immediately a flood of abusive social media software with calls for dismissal, condemnation of centre-left politics and calls that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm much luckier than my peers, because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political.
I'm amazed at the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of racial abuse every day but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become a matter of routine.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is we're already the same pluralist place, and with every no-confidence motion or change in the election rules, the party becomes more of a problem.
For the past two years, many have advised me to shut up, not be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, reeling from the neglect of the Thatcher government that nearly dismantled my public school class, I've been looking for ways to fight for better social services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way confuse my political positions and the issues of my dispute with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the resolution on Friday, all I have to say is that at a time when the country is crawling towards a Brexit that will hurt our families, businesses and public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But actually the one message I have is not to the momentum movement in Nottingham, but to the public of my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of rejection or political expediency will deter me from acting in a way that I believe best serves the interests of all of you.

Air 38-17 from Rose: Air Invincible to the Summit
The last two trimes have slightly altered the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserve a win in today's exciting and spectacular game in the Scottish Premier League.
They're now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the decade.
In the end, it was their better defense, as well as taking a lot more risks, that played for the home team, and coach Peter Moretz had every reason to be pleased.
"We've stood the test of our games so far, and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christie from the Melrose Group said, "Lair deserves all the credit, they took better risks than we did".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute tray, homered by Fraser Climo, put Ayr in the lead, but a yellow card for Scotland player Rory Hughes released for the game by the Warriors allowed Malrose to score points and Jason Baggott caught Trey without a homer.
Climo ups the lead of Ayr with a foul, before that in the half, he rallied and then Myr Trey Solo to get 17-5 for Ayr in the half.
But Malrose opened the second half well and Patrick Angerson's three, who was overtaken by Got, narrowed the gap to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Roderick Knott, who was taken off the bench, and starting from the game's resumption, Air increased the gap through Stafford McDowall's treble, which was hampered by a climb.
Air Force replacement Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again Melrose exploited the extra man with Bruce Colvin's unflinching tray, ending a string of tremendous pressures.
But the home team recovered, and when Stran Tucson got a yellow card for a no-ball climb, from the penalty spot, McPherson scored a touchdown behind Air's forward front.
Clemmo Mir, as he did again almost from the return to the game, after Kyle Roy Ace kicked a David Armstrong punch and sent the quarterback Gregor Henry to the sixth-seeded Trey.
Still Game star seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kearnen appears poised to make the transition to the restaurant business after it was revealed he was named manager of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and stars in alongside his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hempfels.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's final season, and it looks like Keeran is planning for life after Crailing.
According to official records, he's the manager of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source for the Scottish Sun hinted that Kearnan was looking for ways to break into Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
'The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia hopes the court will open a route to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters surrounded by a few ships in La Paz.
Public buildings are flying a navy blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
It's our duty to sue him back".
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource dispute still lives on - as does the yearning to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have been in Chihuahua for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and peace, and it is of course looking forward to the future with a positive attitude, said Roberto Clesdilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians chanted the International Court of Justice ruling on large screens across the country, hoping the Hague court would rule in favor of Bolivia's demand that after decades of interrupted talks, Chile commit to negotiating sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's charismatic native president Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election bid next year - is heavily hanging on a decision on Monday.
We're very close to returning to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
But commentators believe that it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia - and that even if it does, it will not change much.
The UN court sitting in The Hague has no authority to grant Chile territory, and notes that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ICC's decision came only six weeks after hearing the summary arguments suggests that the case was not complicated, but Paz Zareta, a Chilean expert in international law, said.
And instead of advancing Bolivia's claims, the last four years may have even weakened them.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current government in Bolivia", Zarate said.
Morales's belligerent rhetoric wiped out any remaining goodwill on Chile's part, she said.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Valze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was abnormally swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have a great opportunity to open a new era in relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreement for the benefit of both sides, he said.
Cazadilla also denied that Morales - who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - is using the maritime issue as a political lever.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
"The stop is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, has said that his country will never dismantle its nuclear weapons first unless it can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises he made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two rival countries.
His remarks come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of reopening diplomatic contacts on nuclear weapons that have stalled more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri said it was a pipe dream to think that continued sanctions and U.S. resistance to declaring the end of the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
The United States is afraid to agree to a declaration without North Korea first taking significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are interested in a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that North Korea is serious about giving up its nuclear arsenal, which it likely sees as the only way to protect its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
A fashion show in Paris reveals the new trend in giant hats that are on their way to luxury stores everywhere
There's a solution for anyone who wants to expand their hat collection or get complete protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a line of huge, crazy headwear for their SS19 collection, at a fashion show that has dazzled the Paris Fashion Week scene.
Clearly impractical hats took over Instagram this summer, and these designers brought their extraordinary creations to the fashion show circuit.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated blue hat with wide edges resembling feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Other spare-sized accessories included ornate aprons, a magician's hat, and even pineapples - but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of strange masks - checked in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks included sewn lips and more of Hannibal Lecter's blood than Hot Couture's.
One creature mentioned a scuba mask including a snorkel and glasses, and another looked like a melted ice cream cup.
And for those who want to continue with a grand fashion statement, it's time.
Fashion commentators are expecting giant locks to make their way into luxury stores everywhere.
The giant hats are the next big hit after La Bomba, a half-meter-wide straw hat with fringes that's been seen on everyone's heads, from Mariana to Emily Rtaykassky.
The Colt label behind the highly impractical hat that flooded social media spawned another big creation on the track -- a duvet bag almost the size of the one a swimsuit model wore.
The burnt-coloured rug case, with rims of ragweed growths and a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacqueline La Riviera's SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I anticipate big hats and big seaweed tops coming to luxury stores next summer - because the design has made a huge impression and it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this was continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test scores, which is reinforced by individual and group success in sport, art, music and other areas of community making.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, for careers of choice and for their place as citizens of the world.
As a sector of education that is able to design and implement a personalized curriculum, we find that modern languages continue to gain popularity as a sought-after area of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes into his head".
If you speak to a person in his own language, it goes to his heart".
This is an important reminder that we cannot rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of the most recent tests this year, you can see that languages are at the top of the charts with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
An overall 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved a high A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved high A's in Mandarin, as did 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish.
This data shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Today, language as a subject of choice is considered at the same level as STEM subjects in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the British Council for Employment and Skills found that of the reasons employers cited for Cody to fill job vacancies, 17 percent were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming essential to prepare students for future careers.
Given the rising demand for languages for future job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career a person chooses, learning a second language will have a significant advantage in the future because of this lifelong ability.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person at an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language at a level sufficient to have a conversation, and French was the only language with a double-digit percentage of speakers, 15 percent.
That's why it's important to invest in teaching languages to children today.
Knowing many languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages taught.
Some of the schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages that are considered of the utmost importance for Britain looking ahead to the 20th century, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what the child's interest area is, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with a team of teachers who are experts in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, for any future.
There is no denying that today, in a global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, and so this fact should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages are seen as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer these levels of choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's children.
It's a time warrant.
John Edward is the chairman of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron is expected to make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is over for fans who have been waiting to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But it's not yet decided how many minutes he'll play.
It's going to be more than one and less than 48", the Lakers official website says.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump's stop time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump opens a flurry of election arrests tonight in the Wheeling, Virginia area.
This is the first of five planned Trump stops this week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote confirms his nomination for Supreme Court justice, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is the Trump stop in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's stop in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to begin at 7:00 PM Eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump's speech in West Virginia can be watched online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to be referring to the hearings this week for Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh, which turned into a row over allegations of sexual misconduct and the subsequent postponement of the Senate vote for a week while the FBI investigates the allegations.
But the main purpose of this wave of shutdowns is to help Republicans facing a challenging election in November gain some momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the purpose of the five stops next week is to "increase volunteerism and support as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Control of Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president is willing to visit as many countries as possible as the election season gets underway", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who asked not to be identified.
Tonight's rally, scheduled for Wessebunk Stadium in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw media coverage in Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News estimates.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican nominee for senator from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should come to try to improve his polls", Simon Hyder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided draws, the quarterfinals Sunday afternoon may be just what the Ryder Cup needs.
The momentum-driven roller coaster is a completely invented sporting concept, but the players really believe in it, and never more than in competitions like this.
So where do they think the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so you can see a little bit of momentum", said Goran Spieth at the end of the day.
Europe's in the lead, of course, four points ahead with 12 more in play.
But the Americans, as Spitzer says, feel like they have some spirit in the sails, and they have a lot to cheer for, not the least of which is in the form of Spitzer and Justin Thomas who have been playing together all day and each of them is scoring three points out of four.
Spith was lethal from tee to green and he's a leader in personal example.
The cheers intensified as his round went on, as he sank a critical pat to win the all-square game four and Thomas went down two by two.
His pat on the back of a 15 on win has won a similar outcry, the kind that shows he believes the American team still has hope.
"You really just have to dig deep and worry about your own game", said Spieth.
That's all that's left for each of these players to do.
18 laps to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Mephistopheles and Thomas over the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed leading story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but charming pair are four out of four and are loved by all.
"Mollywood was the only couple not to shoot the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back at 9 on Friday morning.
That round, and the way their energy seems to flow into and out of the enthusiastic crowd, establishes the fact that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there will be no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal the potential European victory with the sun setting on the Le Golf National.
Better both at the same time in different ways.
However, it's too early to talk about European fame.
Bob and Tucson Webb Simpson are done with Sergio Garcia, hero of this morning's Four Balls, when he's sleeping with Alex Norn.
Bogey and two doubles in the front nine dropped the Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they came nowhere near getting out of.
However, on Sunday, there's no one to help you out of the hole.
It's fascinating to look closely at the four balls and the quads because of the interactions between the bunches, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is leading significantly towards the final day, but this quarter-final showcased the American team's fighting spirit that some, especially within the United States, have questioned.
Europe lead 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe is in a healthy lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after finishing Saturday's four-ball and foursome with a 10-6 win over the United States.
The inspirational pair Tommy Fleetwood and Wrencesco Molinari led the change with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods, lifting the gap to date at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to defend the trophy they lost at Hazeltin two years ago, reigned against the Americans who missed the four-ball game this morning, bringing the series to 3-1.
The Americans showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, and won two games, but they couldn't close the gap.
To keep the trophy, Jim Forrick's teammates need eight points from their only 12 games.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four consecutive points, while he and Mullinery, nicknamed "Mollywood" after an exceptional weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in the four-ball games, they went on in splendid harmony together to defeat the weakened Woods and the American rookie Bryson DeCambaugh by an even more remarkable score of five and four.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, has shown random bursts of excellence, but so far he has lost 19 of 29 games in the four-ball and four-in-a-row.
Justin Rose, who was suspended during the morning's four-ball games, returned to join Henrik Stenson in the quarterfinals to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are ranked first and third in the world, 2-1
However, not everything went smoothly for the European players in the pleasant weather and the gentle wind blowing southwest of Paris.
The three-time defending champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a 2-1 thrashing of John Ram of Spain and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and later came back to beat Fletcher and Rory McCleary 4-3 in the quarterfinals, after losing the first two rounds.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit to the singles, although as the cup holders, the men of Forick just need a tie to continue holding the trophy.
However, after being second for two days, it seems that the attack on Sunday is beyond their control.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister announced Saturday at the UN that the continuation of sanctions deepens its distrust of the United States and that there is no chance that the country will unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho announced at the UN Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill actions" in the past year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to develop any more nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any consistent response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be certain about our national defense and under such conditions we will by no means unilaterally dismantle ourselves first from nuclear weapons.
While Shri repeated North Korea's well-known complaints about the US's opposition to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization, which would reward North Korea for taking gradual steps, his statement seems significant in that it did not reject the threshold of denuclearization, as North Korea has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to act toward a nuclear dismantling of the Korean Peninsula while Trump pledged to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said North Korea must first give up its nuclear weapons.
The US also opposed calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
The United States insists on denuclearization first and increases sanctions pressure to achieve its goal by force, even opposing declaring an end to the war, Ri said.
The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the harsh sanctions deepen our distrust".
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted in his UN speech earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the disarmament issue had been South Korea and not the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to this impasse".
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that a missile attack on US soil by North Korea was inevitable after President Trump referred to Kim as a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
This year at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened the total destruction of North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no set time frame for that, adding that whether it would take two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward North Korea for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue decisively and without pause until we achieve complete and final nuclear disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea accused him of making gangster demands.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the United States takes "corresponding measures".
He said Kim told him that the "coordinated measures" he was interested in included security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore, as well as changes toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard are taking a course on how to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard this year teaches participants how to sleep more, in an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning by staying up all night with caffeine.
An academic study found that students at the world's top university often have no idea at all about the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kessler, professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to open the course after a lecture he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, one girl came up to me and said, "Why am I only being told this now, in my final year of school?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students the principles of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Breyer, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and senior director of health services at the university, said the university decided to open the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One part shows a room in a dormitory where students press coffee mugs, curtains, sportswear, and books - to get explanations about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a sleep-walking routine.
In another section, participants are told how chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
We know it won't change student behavior overnight.
But we think they have a right to know -- just like you have a right to know the effects of your choice to smoke cigarettes, Professor Chizler added.
He said the culture of pride in achieving a sleepless night still exists, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students are causing the sleep-deprivation problem to grow.
Ensuring adequate sleep, and good sleep quality, should be every student's secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger, so we're hungry all the time.
Raymond Sue, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Tzizzler design the course after attending one of his classes in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had enlightened his eyes and motivated him to encourage a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to ask all undergraduate students to complete a similar curriculum before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Seisel advised students to consider setting a clock that would ring when it was time to go to bed, not just when to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic displays and LED lights, which can disrupt the choreography and thus cause trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Gate of Manga decides to the players of Gerard
The Rangers suffered another attack of defeat in the away game when Dolly Mange caused Steven Gerrard's rebellious players to lose 1-0 to Livingston.
The Aerobics were hoping for their first away win since the February 1-4 victory at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games as manager and left the team eight points behind top-flight Scottish Premier League side Harts.
Manga attacked seven minutes into the half and it didn't look like the Rangers were going to match.
While Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston are up to third and just behind Hibernian in goal difference.
And possibly waiting for another Double Rangers after the line Callum Spence needed treatment for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown at him from the platform.
Gerard made eight substitutions for the team that went on the air to the semi-finals of the Bathford Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came up with the same 11 Livingston players who took a point from the Arts last week, and he could be satisfied with the way his players have stopped the opponents in every situation.
The Rangers may have controlled the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They almost won in the second minute when Menga sent a ball to Scott Patman that kicked Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder kicked the ball too far.
Then a deep free kick by Kagan Jacob found Captain Craig Elkett, but his defender Alan LaGuergue could only kick outside the corral.
The Rangers did take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last quarter.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have ruled in his favor after a quarter, when he and Steven Willis clashed, but referee Steven Thompson waved against the Colombian's shots.
The Rangers managed to kick only two goals in the first half but AeroBuks goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily brake the opening of LaSanna Coulibaly and the weak kick of Obi Ajaria.
While Livingston's 34th-minute start was against the rules, no one will deny they deserved it for their hard work.
Again the Rangers failed to deal with a deep free throw by Jacobs.
Scott Artfield did not respond as Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool by transferring him to Manga for a simple end.
Gerard made an act in the half when he replaced Cullibly with Ryan Kent, and the substitution made an almost instant impact when the extreme/bottom wing threw a ball at Morelos but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block.
But Livingston kept forcing the visiting team to play exactly the kind of game she liked, with the lead and the catcher continuing to send long balls.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the other stages, but McGregor was well positioned to prevent Jacobs' attempt before a corner-coach pulled out.
Rangers replacement Glen Middleton was later charged with another offense against Jacobs, but Thompson again ignored it.
The widow: inventor Mona Geiger
And now to the Sunday Morning calendar: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and on... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Johannes Geiger was born in Germany.
Geyer developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Mona Geiger.
The device has since become a mainstay in science, but in 1950 it also became a mainstay in pop culture with the film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans as two bizarre cowboys/scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that thing?"
Rogers: This is a Geiger's Monograph, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you put on the headphones, you can actually hear the effects of radioactivity on the atoms in minerals".
Owens: "Oh, my God, this is really exploding right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, shortly before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on after him.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot cancer cells and kill them.
A vaccine teaches the immune system to identify cancer cells as part of a treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, and changing the cells in the lab to make them more resistant to infection.
Then the cells can see a protein that's common to many cancers and then they're injected back into the patient.
An experimental vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
In one woman, who received a vaccine that trains the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing the cells in the lab so they can see a protein called HER2 that's common to many cancers, and then injecting the cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Brzowski, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 inhibits the development of several cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, explained Prof. Brzofsky.
A similar approach of taking vaccine cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has been successful in treating a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West broke into a speech in support of Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It wasn't well received.
Kanye West responded to derogatory calls in his studio during a mixed performance on Saturday Night Live, praising US President Donald Trump and saying he will run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song on the show, Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, he broke into a speech against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to white people who say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I'd have left America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL episode began with a sketch starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Burt Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding sexual assault allegations brought up by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although the keynote address was not aired on the show, the segment was posted to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to pull West's weight in that commercial.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had been criticized behind the scenes for the hat he was wearing.
They attacked me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out on stage with that hat on".
They attacked me!
And then they said I was in a dark place, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "You want to see the dark place?" by saying he's wearing my Superman hat, because that means no one can tell me what to do.
Try to show love".
His remarks received at least two derogatory readings from the audience, and there were apparently embarrassed SNL crew members, Variety reported, one of whom told the newspaper: "Deep silence fell over the entire studio".
West is joining the show as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-husband, Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West stunned the fuss when he performed the song I Love It while wearing a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for not giving in to the crowd".
But the host of the Actualidad program, the Hunter Foundation, tweeted that West was just who he was and that was absolutely wonderful.
But I chose not to reward (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his art) that I believe fosters and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free to go.
And so are we, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "an entity formerly known as Kenya West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Papi and P-Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Doc, went by the name Snoop Lion, and of course the famous musician Prince changed his name to Snoop and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
According to the police, the incident took place in Bliach.
The suspect is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
The star of Game of Thrones, Keith Harrington, is attacking the toxic male
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as Jon Snow, the swordsmith from the violent fantasy-adventure series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the hero Matsuo, saying that such roles on screen often convey the message to young children that they must be tough to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something had gone wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married another Game of Thrones star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he was "very concerned" about the treatment of this issue.
Personally, I feel very disturbed right now - where did we go wrong with masculinity?
What are we teaching men in their growing years, from the perspective of the problem we're seeing now?
Keith thinks television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, because of the very masculine characters it portrays.
He continued: "What comes from within and what can we learn from without?
What do we learn from television, and from the street, that makes young boys feel they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because there's no doubt something went wrong for young men.
In an interview, he admitted that he would not be participating in any sequel or spin-off series of Game of Thrones after the series ended the following summer, saying that he was "done with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Keith will star in a reboot of Sam Shepard's play The Real West, which tells the story of a film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he sees meeting his wife Rose as the best thing that ever happened as a result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife on the show, so in this way the show gave me my future family, and my life from that moment on", he said.
Rose played Yegret, the love interest of John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The two married in June 2018 in the courtyard of the Lasley family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are infected, according to health officials.
Some 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were from sexual contact, which is a change from the past.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood clots.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan Province.
Yet, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen by 100,000.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is a burning problem in the Chinese healing community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people of good will is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of the disease are the result of inadequate protection in these sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that anyone on her staff leaked information about a Republican senator and defends the "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories" that are being used to frame her.
U.S. Senator Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three U.S. senators on the senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democratic senator from Los Angeles estimated that the claims are being spread by extreme right-wing websites and critics.
"Lies, lies and more lies are abhorrent", Waters said in a tweet.
According to reports, the information released included the residences and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, and was released by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on charges of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address that identified the source of the ads was associated with Waters' office and published the information on a member of Waters' team, according to the Hill report.
"This baseless accusation is completely false and utterly false", Waters added.
My colleague - whose identity and personal details were exposed and whose safety was compromised as a result of these false and false accusations - was in no way responsible for this leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and utterly false".
Waters' announcement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
That's denial in anger, writes Fletcher.
That indicates she doesn't have the temperament required of a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't react in anger.
He can't react in a hurry.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
He's got to be calm and his own".
Fletcher seemed to be comparing Waters' response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his thoughts.
"Great if that's true", he tweeted.
In her announcement, Waters said her office has contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement about these false allegations.
We're gonna make sure the perpetrators are exposed, is the next step, that they're held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous actions against my team members.
Review of Johnny English 3.0 - A weakened spy parody starring Rowan Atkinson
It's now common to look for Brexit-related meanings in any new film with a British perspective, and it does seem to fit this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy parody - which began somewhere in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will an ironic self-pity about how useless we are become our country's new export opportunity?
Anyway, the glowing-eyed, rubber-faced, full-blooded Johnny Englishman got another chance to mess things up - and his name symbolizes more than anything that this is a wide-ranging comic piece aimed at non-English speaking movie-goers.
He's of course the stupid English agent, who, despite his strange, glossy face, looks a little bit like Clouseau, a little bit Mr. Bean and plenty of that guy who contributed a single note to the fire-chariots pleasantness in the opening text of the London Olympics in 2012.
It is also based on the original mystery international traveller played by Atkinson in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
There's a nice minute or two in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I liked the part where Johnny English approaches the helicopter in his medieval armor, and the propeller beams ring for moments on his helmet.
Atkinson demonstrates his comic physical abilities, but the humor feels rather weak and strangely unnecessary, especially since the "serious" genre of spy films like 007 and Mission Impossible itself now include a comic element.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English's wildly failed adventures are less brilliant and focused than Atkinson's silent-film-style jokes as Mr. Bean.
The plot of the film begins when great danger threatens Britain.
A hacker broke into the super-secret British intelligence network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the alarm of the lead agent - a small role, unfortunately, for Kevin Aldon.
This is the final straw for a boastful, battle-hardened prime minister, already suffering a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best to fill the role of Theresa May, but she doesn't have much to work with from the script.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that since every active spy is exposed, she'll have to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means Johnny English, the arrogant self-respecting, now employed as a school principal at a prestigious institution, but giving informal lessons on how to be a covert spy: some good jokes here, when English offers a Rock School-style spy academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for emergency instruction and reunites with his former assistant to the pain mode Buffy, again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a man married to a submarine commander, in the role of a pesky class queen over whom Vico Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service get into a terrible mess again, when faced with the beautiful Pam-Fatall in the role of Ophelia Boltoba played by Olga Korylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems - the evil Jason Volta in the age of Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their Odyssey which is more of a two-clown farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant; they create an underworld as they exfiltrate themselves on Volta's magnificent yacht; and English finds complete anarchy in his attempt to use an AR machine to learn about the inner structure of Volta's house.
No doubt all efforts are being made to lead to the final sequence, but despite the amusing and the shocking, it has the feel of children's television.
Pretty average, you know.
And like other English Gunsmoke films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really did justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies it is preparing a plan for the British to work four days a week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a revolutionary plan whereby Britons will work four days a week - but will be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants corporate executives to pass on the savings from the AI revolution to employees in the form of an extra day off.
That means the workers will have a three-day weekend, and they'll still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea fits the company's economic agenda and plans to tilt the state in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supports the transition to a four-day workweek as a way for workers to enjoy the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year".
This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that fits the party's approach to rebalancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party called for a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the ambition is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not party policy and the party is not considering it".
Labour's candidate for Treasury Secretary, John McDonnell, used the party convention last week to outline his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to draw back power from faceless executives and price-setting utilities.
The plans of the Chancellor's candidate also suggest that existing shareholders in water companies may not get their full investment back because the Labour government may make "reductions" on the basis of disclosure of improper behaviour.
He also confirms that there are plans to add employees to company boards and to create "capital-intensive funds" to transfer 10 per cent of private-sector companies' capital to employees, who will receive two-year dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told 60 Minutes that if the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh changes their minds,
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Bert Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his Supreme Court nomination for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of the investigation will convince which Republican to withdraw his support.
In an idea aired Sunday on 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Flea asked Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"That is, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said before the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kawano.
I called him after it happened, the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was decisive, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, however, seems to be set in stone.
I've already decided about Bert Kavanaugh and there's gonna be a need for an explosive indictment, he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bert has denied it vigorously", Graham added, referring to Christine Blazy Ford.
And no one she mentioned could verify that.
It's 36 years old.
I can't see how anything can change".
What is the World Citizens Festival and has it contributed anything to poverty reduction?
Saturday, New York will host the Citizens of the World Festival, an annual music event with a most impressive list of stars to perform and a no less impressive goal of ending world poverty.
The World Citizens Festival, now in its seventh year, will bring tens of thousands of people to a sprawling Central Park not only to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true purpose - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which began in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you're willing to pay for a VIP card), you must complete a series of tasks on the concert island, or actions such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the festival really, with only 12 years left to accomplish its goal?
Is the idea of giving people free concert tickets really a way to convince them to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of "clickability" -- people feeling like they're really making an impact by signing up for a gig online or tweeting?
Since 2011, Citizens World says it has documented more than 19 million actions by its supporters, pushing for a variety of different causes.
These actions, he said, helped bring together world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements as a result of its activities, of which at least $10 billion had already been distributed or fundraised.
The group estimates that the funds allocated have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and activists committed to helping children grow to their full potential, pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social justice on undernutrition a side note in history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracy Allman told the audience during the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions called on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website that asks, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The world's citizens replied: "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mona are among some of the acts to perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborah-Lee Forrester and Hugh Jackman.
US can use Navy for blockade to delay Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary, Washington could use the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, "U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink has revealed, as quoted in the Washington Examiner.
Zinck argued that Russian involvement in Syria -- which was, it's important to mention, at the behest of the legitimate government -- would accelerate expansion into new energy markets.
"I believe the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to mediate energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe", he reportedly said.
And according to the official source, there are ways and means to deal with it.
The United States is able, with our navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, when necessary, to blockade to ensure that their energy sources do not reach the market, he said.
Zinke was speaking at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are indeed identical.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is, more or less, leverage and substitution of fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" because its economy is dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to increase its exports of refined natural gas to Europe, while replacing Russian energy sources, which are a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to cancel its participation in the "unfit" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has turned Berlin into Moscow's hostage.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is supposed to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion MEUR, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's determined opposition to the project is motivated solely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The US position won a strong backlash from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The German Industry Association (BDI), the leading organization in the German industrial sector, called on the Arabs to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply", Dieter Kampff, head of the German Industry Association (BDI), said following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed his intention to run for president during a meeting at Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, and to do that, we need a woman at the helm", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I'll seriously consider running for president.
Warren expressed her opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council meeting, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
I'm worried to the bone about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy, she said.
Warren has been harshly critical of Trump's appointment of Bert Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Tuesday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run in the 2020 election.
Fifty-eight percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run for office, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of running for the Senate.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick's run, with 38 percent supporting his option to run against 48 percent opposing it.
Associated figures from the Democratic Party who have risen in the context of a possible 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he'll make a formal decision in January, according to IP reports.
Sarah Palin is noting the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the Army in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on the night of the shooting.
"What my son is going through, what he's been going through since he got back, allows me to identify with families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and with some of the trauma that our soldiers are recovering", she told the crowd at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other ex-soldiers, "They come back a little different, they come back tough, they come back wondering if what they gave to the country, their fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other military people, is being honored".
He was arrested Tuesday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic assault and battery on a woman, tampering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of refusing to provide shelter to victims fleeing situations involving gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court statement on Friday in Washington to support the challenge to asylum-seeker policies, according to NBC News.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, has not been disclosed.
She said she was abused by her violent husband, Juan, a gang member, but U.S. government officials denied her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Grace's state attorneys described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have filed a large number of asylum applications in the United States, as nations facing many problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 decision by the BIA Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Ressin said in a statement Sunday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all discussions of asylum applications be based on the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and the new policy's positioning barrier violates that principle, the court's friend said in a statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the policy, which restricts immigrants, harms the U.S. economy, as they tend to become entrepreneurs and provide much-needed jobs, they said.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"Asylum is open to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of persecution on the grounds of race, religion, nationality or membership in a specific social group or because of political opinion", Sessions said in a policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems -- even the most serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Rescue efforts are desperate in Palo, as the killing spree doubles, the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more difficult by the minute.
"There is a very tense feeling", said Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother with a baby who is suffering from a fever in the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palo.
Any minute now, the ambulance is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, scraping through water-soaked objects, trying to salvage whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake, were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered from back and shoulder fractures, were lying outside the Palo Military Hospital, where they were being treated for the strong aftershocks that continued after the earthquake.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the rubble of the wall, I think, Harris told AP, adding that his family was in town to attend the wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, and then she was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're in a safe place.
The US ambassador accuses China of "propaganda"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily, aggressively promoting U.S.-China trade advantages, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Sunday addressed a charge for the Chinese newspaper China Daily, the best-selling newspaper in Iowa, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, claiming China rejected it.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the US election marked a new stage, according to US officials, in the escalation campaign being run by Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is natural for foreign governments to issue trade promotion ads, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a bloody trade war in which each country raises and compares tariffs on its rival's imports.
The tariffs, which China imposed as retaliatory measures early in the trade war, were intended to hurt exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, American and Chinese experts said.
Terry Bernstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, former governor of Iowa for many years, and a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Bernstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Sunday edition of The Wine Register, "enhances the practice of bullying by publishing ads in our free press".
In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of free speech and the press, and is posting a paid ad in the Des Moines Register, Bernstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper booths on the streets of Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have on the worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that one of China's leading newspapers had evaded the offer to publish his article, although he did not specify which newspaper.
Republicans are pushing women's votes away from the midterm elections with the Kavanaugh incident, analysts warn
While many Republican Party leaders are supporting Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh and defending him over multiple sexual assault allegations, analysts warned they will see a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around the issue has been particularly lively, and the majority of Republicans are officially demonstrating their desire to move forward with the voting process.
"You can't turn this back", Grant Rieher, a political science lecturer at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reyer said he doubted that Senator Geoff Flake's last-minute efforts to open an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November, said Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive Movement on Monday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Tuesday morning, protesters shouted "November Comes!" as they demonstrated in the Senate Corridor, as the Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee chose to continue advancing Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, according to Mic.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation levels will break new records, said Stu Rottenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
People say they've been high; they're right.
But they can be higher, especially among the floating votes of suburban women and among young voters, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, despite their dislike of the president, often avoid voting.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which repudiated her allegations of sexual assault of the Supreme Court nominee, analysts argued that there could be a backlash if Republicans continued to push for confirmation.
The nomination has caused the Republicans serious trouble, said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just the committee vote or the final vote or whether Quanno gets the nomination, but also how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that assists Democrats in their election.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the extent to which they believe the statements made by Ford and Quanno, with support slightly higher for Ford.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony with certainty or probable, while 35 percent said they believed Quanno with certainty or probable.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Quanno had definitely or probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and the allegations made by at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, according to reports in The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Quano assaulted her while drunk when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed Abreu to her during a party they attended while they were students at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to start a new web to beat Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the man who became a legend in the tech world, is a company that will develop Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
The Solid platform allows its users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be allowed access to the different types of data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said about the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create a personal online database or POD.
The database may include a contact list, lists of activities to be performed, a timetable, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
Imagine if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online database is that it is solely the user who decides who can access the information and what kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "data-powered personalization".
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the intention is that Inrupt will find the right resources, process and capabilities to help bring Solid to everyone.
Today the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a team of several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer code designers.
Starting this week, technology developers from around the world will be able to create distributed applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether or not they will allow a complete change that will cause a complete and overnight reversal of all their business models.
We're not asking for their permission.
In a post published in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and environmental systems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built at Solid3.
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the face of the Internet when he founded the Web-fixing organization, W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as founder and director of the W3C, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm particularly optimistic about the next era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Memorial to the Victorian Clergyman of World War I
The only Anglican clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a combatant during World War I is commemorated at an event in his home town 100 years after the victory.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Reverend Bernard Van, was awarded the Victoria Cross on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain's highest honour.
The victory stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Braden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said that exposing the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the same honor is "incredibly symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion across the St Kent Canal through heavy fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
He then rushed to the line of fire and with the greatest of speed led the line forward before rushing to take control of the sub-scene with one hand and knocking out three of the company.
Lieutenant-Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's work was something I know I could never match but something that humbled me.
He and his brother, Dr James Van, also put on a tour after the parade, leading the Royal Brentwood Youth Orchestra.
Michael Van said he was "very honored to be part of the march" and added "the courage of a true hero is shown in the support you have given to so many people".
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Blatter 206, and instead got Pepe Pig.
Imagine staying up all night to watch the action of Baltar 206 and finally being denied the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose Show featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live overnight on the British Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Jagard Musassi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, viewers in Britain were stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed by the change, having stayed up until the early hours of the morning especially to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the move to a children's cartoon as a kind of sick joke.
"It's a government regulation that says that at 6 a.m. the original content wasn't appropriate and so they had to switch to kids programs", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Blatter, said when asked about the broadcast.
- What?
Blatter Corporation president Scott Cocker said they intend to work on their schedules to include British Scouts in the future.
"I think when I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can probably figure it out", said Cocker.
But it's six in the morning on the day of the event and we can't solve the problem until the day of the event in our time zone, which is the day of the event in their time zone.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, during the transition, there were a lot of text messages between the parties, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, thought it was a technical glitch.
But no, it was a government issue.
I can assure you that next time it's not going to happen.
We only cleaned five fights instead of six - as we usually do - we tried to give the fans more and we just overdid it.
It's a matter of lack of appreciation.
Tom Daly felt abandoned because of his sexual orientation.
Tom Daly, the Olympic diver, said that as a teenager he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexual orientation -- but that feeling motivated him to become successful.
The 24-year-old jumper said he didn't know until he got to high school that not everyone was like me.
In an interview on Desert Island Discs, Radio 4, hosted by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less worried about winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the old show, Christy Young, has been on sick leave for several months.
In his first appearance as the star of the show, Daly said he felt inferior to others growing up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said, "To this day, the feeling of inferiority, and the feeling of being different, have been the real things that have given me strength and power and allowed me to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was something, he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually found out what his sexual orientation was.
The two-time Olympic gold medallist has become a well-connected leader of the LGBT community and used his participation in this year's British Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to legalize homosexuality.
He spoke out about it because he felt lucky to be given the opportunity to live openly and without consequences and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "caught me by surprise".
Daly married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age gap was never a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- he competed in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone his age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June, a white man named Robert Ray Black-Dailey, and Dailey said his whole point of view had changed.
If you asked me last year, everything revolved around "I should win the gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is a ruby.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the London 2012 Olympics - because he wanted to be on the front row.
I couldn't tell him you wouldn't be here to be on the front line, Dad, he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and it was only when he stopped breathing and died that I finally knew he wasn't invincible", he said.
A year later, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a gold medal.
I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of all my life - diving in front of my home crowd at the Olympics, it didn't feel better, he said.
It's also what inspired him to choose his first song - "Proud" by the Small Head - which he identified during the preparations for the Olympic Games and still makes him go duck.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15pm British time.
Michaelson was disappointed in his performance and went to the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American golfer Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup, but he'll need to upgrade his performance so the event doesn't turn into a disastrous one.
Michaelson, who is competing in the biennial event for the 12th time and setting a record, was benched at the behest of Jim Furyk during the four-ball and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the action, as he usually does in games with the U.S. team, Michaelson, a five-time Major League winner, spent half the day cheering and the other half working on his game on the sidelines in hopes of repairing the sickness he suffered.
Even at the peak of his career, the player's performance suffered ups and downs. Therefore, 48-year-old Michaelson is not the ideal choice for National Golf, where long grass courses are usually not forgiving of stray punches.
And if the competition itself isn't deterring enough, Michaelson, in Game 9 of Day 1, competed against the reigning British Formula One champion, Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and won all four of their games this week.
If the American's ambition, having lost four points in the first 12 games, was to succeed in the first stages, Michaelson's play could have been decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, although we didn't expect him to say anything else.
"He understood his role perfectly today, patted me on the back, wrapped his arm around me and said he'd be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's added a lot to these selections in the past, and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but that's how it turned out and that's how we thought it should go.
He wanted to be on the track, just like all the other players.
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games on Sunday.
You may end his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really matched the heights of his personal best.
Michaelson's record stands at 18 wins, 20 losses and seven ties, although Furyk said his presence added certain intangible benefits to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make people laugh, and it's fun to be in the dressing room with him, he explained.
I think the younger players enjoyed having fun with him this week, too, and it was nice to see that.
It's a lot more than the game itself.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great advantage may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles matches could turn bad.
The Danish player started his career in Valderrama in 1997, when his teammate, Grandpa Ballesteros, had a 5-point lead over the Americans, which he almost lost when he crossed the finish line with a narrow lead and won 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a big advantage at Waldrama; that we had a big advantage in the game in Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Waldrama where we won but with a marginal advantage", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching a 5-3 win at the 2018 tournament both on and off the field, which led to a 10-6 lead at La National Golf.
Then history will prove to me and everyone on this team that it's not over.
We should give it all away tomorrow.
You got to get on the track and do all the right things.
It's not over until the dots are off the board.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we need to focus on that.
I've said all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're very aware of those on the other side -- the best players in the world.
Byrne was pleased with his players' performance on the difficult golf course and added: "It is important to me never to be late in golf.
Tomorrow could be completely different.
Tomorrow, the focus will be on personal performance, and that's completely different.
It's a pleasure to be on the course when everything is going well, but when you're out there alone, then your full potential as a golfer is being tested.
And that's the message we need to get across to the players: You need to make the most of yourself tomorrow.
Now, you're leaving your partner behind and he's got to make the best of himself.
Unlike Voren, opposing team captain Jim Furyk would expect better individual performances from his players, compared to their performance in the doubles, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself knows both the winning side and the losing side, during the important finals days of tournaments of this type, having participated in the winning team in Brooklyn before losing, as a European team that managed to win by miracle in the final game, as documented in the film Miracle at Medinah.
I remember every word, he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players for the final day.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but I want to make it through the first few rounds, like you saw in Brooklyn, and like you saw in Medina.
When that momentum goes to one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We're setting up our vehicle accordingly and putting the guys on the track as we feel like, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow.
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the fight and will face Rory McLaren in the top game, with Paul Cassay, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Fulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I chose this lineup because I think he's going to get us to the finish", said Bjorn, referring to his single-player selection.
The receipt of Germany's new warship was again denied
Germany's new navy frigate was supposed to be delivered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but was rejected for at least a year, due to faulty systems and a falling cost, local media reported.
The receipt of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been delayed until the first half of 2019, the Die Zeit newspaper reported citing a military spokesman.
The cruiser was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but troubling post-supply issues shut down the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class all-terrain vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are expected to include a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile batteries, and elusive technologies such as acoustic signals, infrared and reduced radar.
Other important features include longer service periods - the newest frigates can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, repeated delays mean that the innovative ships - which are supposed to allow Germany to send troops overseas - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Di Zeit noted.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss yard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder since its removal.
Not much is known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of critical software and hardware flaws that rendered the warship unusable for combat use.
The program flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet would be operated by about 120 sailors - about half the crew that served on the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, the ship was found to have a dramatic overweight that reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The ship Rheinland-Pfalz weighs 7,000 tons, and is twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from the flawed software, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It has reportedly reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) - well above the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that fascinate the newest frigates are becoming especially troubling in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's security committee, confirmed that the navy is currently short of ships capable of dismantling.
The official said the problem had accelerated and intensified over time, as older ships were decommissioned but not replaced by other vessels.
He expressed regret that no Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could be attached to the Navy.
The Scottish National Trust is listening to the secret lives of bats
A new study at a farm in the Scottish Highlands aims to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, which is being edited by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow bats and European bats as well as brown and long-eared Dobbinton bats at the West Ross Inbrew Gardens.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld sensors.
A specialist voice analysis of all the recordings will determine the frequency of the bat calls and which species is responsible for them.
In the next step, the map of the habitats is shortened to create a detailed, landscape-wide picture of their behavior patterns.
Rob Dwar, conservation adviser for the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the octopus and how each species uses them.
This information will help to determine the benefits of the work of managing the habitats, such as the creation of native trees and how best to conserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across Britain have declined dramatically over the past century.
They are threatened by development and construction, which affects nesting and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, and this is also true of fly traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks from house cats.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, the ears of bats are more useful in capturing prey.
They use sophisticated technique of tracking by sound to locate insects and identify obstacles to their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 760,000 acres of land across the country, takes the slums very seriously.
She has 10 trained specialists, who regularly conduct surveys, nesting tests and sometimes even rescue.
The organisation also established the first and only bat sanctuary at the Tarrib Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson said the estate was the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Tribe we have a great area for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right living areas.
But there's still a lot that's unknown about bats, so the work we're doing here and at other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stressed the importance of bat testing before performing maintenance work on the property, as the unintentional destruction of a single nest in a population could destroy up to 400 females and pups, and possibly even the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and killing, harassing, disturbing bats or destroying their nesting grounds is prohibited by law.
Elizabeth Pearl, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to join in and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats and about many of our species, we just don't know what their population status is".
Ronaldo dropped the rape charges while lawyers prepare to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying people wanted to promote themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal international Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mirga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Dr. Spiegel reported on Friday.
Ronaldo, 33, addressed his 142 million Instagram followers in a live video a few hours after the allegations were made and called the reports "fake news" in disdain.
- No, no, no, no, no. - What are you doing?
What they said yesterday, Pike News, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's all right.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
"I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which were described as "an unacceptable report on privacy concerns", according to a Reuters report.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the actor will seek compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the severity of the violation, arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Murga reportedly returned to the player's room and the player allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Miurga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her he was a "99% good guy" who had failed at 1%.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that they were consensual.
Mirga also claims that she went to the police and that eight of her injuries were filmed in a hospital, but that she subsequently agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "resentful of revenge" and feared "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now willing to cancel the arrangement as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was set to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and moved to Italian club Juventus in the summer for a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain still regrets the loss of car manufacturers
Britain will forever regret losing its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said UK business minister Greg Clark.
He added that the BBC interview with Toyota Britain, where it said that if Britain left the EU without a deal it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnston, near Derby, was "worrying".
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could increase jobs.
The Bernstone plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avant models - produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90 percent of which are exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will see the production stop at our plant", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's chief executive at Bernstone.
Other carmakers in the UK have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal and how it will affect cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what the car manufacturers call "supply chain risks" in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a precision-to-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes, from British suppliers and the rest of the EU, to produce cars to order.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruption at the border, and industry insiders say it could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota can't keep more than a day's worth of stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company says, so production is halted.
Clark said Theresa May's "Chasers" plan, which outlines Britain's future relationship with the European Union, is being minimized precisely to prevent these checks at the border.
"We want to reach the best possible agreement, as I said, not just to enjoy the success in the present, but to take advantage of the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The testimonials from Toyota and other car manufacturers are that the ability to continue to use the successful supply chain system that we have had to date is absolutely essential.
Toyota did not say how long the production shutdown would last, but in the longer term, it warned that the increased costs would hurt the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to layoffs.
Peter Cuevalaris, who worked at Barnaston for 24 years and serves as the president of the Unite union at the plant, said that union members are increasingly concerned: "Mansion, if the jobs are cut, they will never be restored".
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union".
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, much of which is pending, may be "delayed for another week" as the battle for Supreme Court nominee Bert Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Tuesday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and a possible resumption of investigations by the president.
The rumors in Washington have been debated for months as to whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of carrying a wire to record conversations with Trump and get the president impeached through the 25th Amendment to the Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Thursday he arrived at the White House, and was reportedly about to resign.
Instead, we set up a meeting on Tuesday with Trump, who was staying at the time of Rosenstein's arrival at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he'd prefer not to fire Rosenstein but at this point the meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, and again delayed the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News on Sunday.
In response to a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "We haven't set a date for the meeting yet, it may be this week, I can see it being postponed another week given what's going on at the Supreme Court".
But we'll see and I'm always happy to update the press.
Some reporters will challenge this determination: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host, asked why.
Sanders said the rarity of the updates did not stem from the news media's positioning, although she said: "I will not deny the fact that they are taking a position".
She then offered to increase direct contact between Trump and the press.
The president has more Q&A sessions than any other president before him, she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've checked the numbers".
Press briefings will still be held, Sanders said, but if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this on many occasions, and you've seen that we've done it on many occasions in the last few weeks, and meetings that allow you to talk to the president of the United States will replace press directives.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends open meetings or press conferences during honorary visits.
His press-only parties are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated the reason for this, in a loose and sometimes bizarre performance to reporters gathered on the spot.
The Health Service is writing to EU staff at NHS Scotland, addressing concerns about Brexit.
The Health Department has written to the EU staff, who are employed by the National Health Service of Scotland, to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to accommodating applications for permanent status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in the letter: "Throughout the summer, the UK-EU negotiations on exit continued, and it is moving towards the decisions expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this can be a very stressful time for all of you.
So I wanted to come back and say how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the team, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and the world bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is without doubt your home and we very much want you to stay here.
Christian Abercombe is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
University of Tennessee Tigers quarterback Christian Abercombe has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Commodores at Vanderbilt University, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of the University of Tennessee team, told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He went to the edge of the field and just collapsed there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercombe oxygen on the sidelines and then lifted him onto a bench and took him for further testing.
A University of Tennessee official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercombe was being transferred to Vanderbilt Medical Center for surgery.
Harris added that there are no details yet on the type/scale of the surgery and the University of Tennessee is still trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercombe is a student-athlete and this is his first season with the University of Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He made five total tackles before leaving the game, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will face higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK and the additional income will be used to help the homeless, under the new Conservative plan.
The move would neutralize Corbyn's successful move to attract new voters.
The stamp duty is levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects the tax to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp tax rate when buying property in the UK - the extra income will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move appears to be an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's move to attract young voters, with promises to provide cheaper housing and focus on higher-income earners.
The stamp tax will be levied on people and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will strengthen the government's move to help those old in dire circumstances.
The payment, which comes in addition to the current stamp tax, including higher tax rates on second homes and real estate investments for rent - could be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new properties built in London are purchased by foreign residents, causing prices to rise and making it difficult for first-time homebuyers to get on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for stamp tax cuts to help young people buy their first home.
He blamed big building companies for the high property prices, as they take land but don't use it, and urged Mrs May to abandon the affordable housing levy and fix Britain's housing scandal.
Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and a halt to "no-fault" evictions.
He also wants to give councils more power to build new houses.
May said: "Last year I said I would devote my term to rebuilding the British Dream - which is basically that life is supposed to be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, and companies whose assets are in foreign countries, can buy homes as easily as hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home ownership has become too distant for too many people, and the humiliation of sleeping in harsh conditions is too real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has said his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland manager at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is enjoying the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are currently third in the Premier League, three points clear of the top of the table.
He moved to the Summer Light Stadium after leading St Mirren back to Scottish first place last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once played in an international match and that's it, Ross told the BBC's Scottish programme Sportsound.
But growing up, I watched the Scotland team play Hampden a lot with my dad as a kid, and it was always something that drew me back.
Anyway, that opportunity will only come if I manage the team.
Sunderland's previous directors include Dick Adbucket, David Moyes, Sam Alderdays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Foy and Paulo DiCanio.
The former manager of Aloha Athletic says he was not afraid to go after such established names at such a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
For me, success right now is measured by whether I can get the club back into the Premier League.
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, there's no doubt that it belongs to the Premier League, he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I can only see myself as a success story here if I can get the club back there.
Ross began his managerial career just three years ago, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as team manager of Hearts.
He helped the A's win promotion from League One and lift St Mirren from the bottom of the table to the championship the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Milton Academical.
It was probably a real crossroads, he recalled, about taking command of Aloha.
I really believed that the management position suited me more than the game.
That sounds weird because I played well, I made a reasonable profit, and I enjoyed some reasonable records.
But an actor's career can be tough.
There's a lot of stuff you have to deal with every week.
I still deal with you guys when it comes to the stress and pressure at work, but management just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I've never felt more comfortable with myself as an adult.
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound, Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland from 12pm to 1pm, British summer time.
The perfect time for a pint of beer is 5:30 on a Saturday, according to the poll.
The summer heat wave boosted the profits of struggling British pubs, but put pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups enjoyed a 2.7 percent sales increase in July - but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy, which collected the data, said: "The continued clear weather and England's expected prolonged participation in the World Cup mean that July had a similar pattern to June, with pub revenues up 2.8 per cent, but restaurants suffered an even harder blow.
The 1.8% decline in restaurant sales seen in June only intensified in July.
Pubs and bars focused on drinks recorded the strongest performance, with higher growth in declining revenue in the restaurant business, compared to the previous period.
Food-focused pubs also suffered from the sun, although their situation was less dramatic than that of restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among chain pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell 3 percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM, a data analyst for leisure and hospitality, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major sporting or social events are the most important factors in the outdoor leisure market.
It's no surprise that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in addition to all the half-fixed costs.
The long, hot summer couldn't have come at a worse time for food-focused businesses, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will bring about the much-needed slowdown.

One in five children has a social media account that they hide from their parents.
A survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a surge in fake Instagram pages.
The news raised concerns about the advertising of sexual content
20 percent of the students said they had a primary account that they showed to their parents.
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 middle school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts - as the photo-sharing site Instagram reminds us.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students said they run a clean primary account to show their parents, but that they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled upon her 13-year-old teenage daughter's secret account found her asking others to rape me.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 have two profiles and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many young people are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Aelide Doyle will serve as the voice of the Scottish Athletes' Directory.
Aelide Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external director at the annual general meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in track and field and chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a wonderful opportunity for those guiding the sporting industries to benefit from its rich international experience over the past decade.
"Ayleed has earned a great deal of respect among the Scottish, British and international athletic community and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit immensely from her being on the board", Beatty said.
Doyle said: "I am excited to be the voice for the athletes and hope I can contribute and really help guide the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and four Olympic gold medals in all, and who now regularly serves as a commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk after suffering a transient stroke.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time will tell if they're better or how well.
It was a knee job, but I've made a full recovery, I've learned how to walk again, and today I'm doing quick and quick reaction exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement!
Advertising for milk pumps comparing mothers to cows online opinion party
A dairy company has split the internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what is supposed to be the world's first wearable silent milk pump, consumer technology company Elvie released a humorous video ad to demonstrate the operational freedom the new pump gives to motherhood.
Four real moms dancing in a haystack full of cows to the sounds of a song that included words like, "Yeah, I'm milking myself, but you can't see a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not the breasts, it's my breasts".
The song goes on to say, "I suck, suck, I feed the babies, suck, suck, I milk my girls".
But the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, caused a rift online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed responses from viewers, many of whom said it shed light on the horrors of the dairy industry.
It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they also need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within days of the launch, someone wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is discreetly integrated into the breast.
Another comment said: "Of course, traumatic as a cow and a calf".
But hey, why not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?
Another comment said, "Avertment completely disconnected".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted she thought the song was "laughing".
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breast-feeding.
The inhalation made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I've been looking into the content.
It's a brilliant product, someone wrote.
Another commenter said: "This is a funny ad for moms who are sweating (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like cows".
This is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they all danced with the discreet pumps inside their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women, who use the milk pump, say they feel like cows.
But Elvie's pump is completely silent, without pipes and wires, it's discreetly integrated into the breastfeeding breast and thus gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out during the breastfeeding.
Anna Ballerin, partner and head of Early Childhood Development at Mother, noted: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative spin.
By making the comparison between women expressing themselves and cows milking, we wanted to put the milk pumping and all the challenges that come with it in the spotlight, and to demonstrate in a fun, relatable way, the amazing sense of freedom that the new pumping will bring.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked the runway for designer Martha Jackowski using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of immigrant children in detention has soared even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, and one of the reasons for this is that the Trump administration's discourse and policies have made it harder to transfer children to foster care.
Typically, most sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves, and they feared risking their ability to stay in the country by applying for custody of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other elderly household members would be required to hand over fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Alvans, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had filed to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of the sponsors or their household members are in the country illegally, and a large portion of them are foreign criminals.
That's why we keep going after God's people, Mr. Alvans said.
In an effort to provide solutions for the children more quickly, officials introduced new laws requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days as was the norm under previous regulations, shelter workers reported.
Many will appear via video chat and conference, rather than face-to-face, to present their legal status arguments to an immigration judge.
Those found not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer these children are in care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempted escape, shelter workers said, and reports released from the system in recent months.
Counselors say these fears are exacerbated in larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs of a child's distress are likely to be overlooked, given the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to separate from friends may aggravate the trauma many already face.
Syria is telling the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'amil also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Mowlam, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally under the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and have been treated accordingly.
They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally, he said.
They stressed that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced.
He said Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we clear Syrian lands of terrorist organizations and all illegal foreign presence as well.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly for training and advising the Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 fighters on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Maullam said that conditions for their return were good and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that motivated refugees to keep their distance.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with their return", he said.
They're politicizing an issue that's supposed to be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not send aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
However, the agreement's underlined commitments were "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would focus on jihadists, including victory front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who were being destroyed.
UN envoy Stefan de Mistura hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new commission, composed of members of the government and the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Maulaem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee and said the panel's work should be limited to examining the provisions of the current constitution, and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers obviously hope, rejection and scandal end his presidency before his time.
During what will be arguably the most dramatic closing episode in the history of the presidency of all time!
Right now, there's no sign of fatigue in the scouts.
Since 2014, peak viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in its prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and the Rachel Meadow Show on MSNBC topped the cable ratings with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we understand", said Neil Barr, executive producer of the ABC drama series "The Designated Survivor", which follows a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the capital.
And some hard truths about infiltrating the Hollywood male circle have another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he voted for Trump.
She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scobel told me.
Chaos has value in my mind.
Of course, unlike any other TV show, the storylines coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade decision, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
Switching channels or ignoring is a luxury only the most skilled viewers can afford.
And yet, you are crossing the line as an intelligent citizen when you find yourself watching for six hours a panel of Danish experts on Bob Woodward's use of hidden media as the source of Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 leather bomber jacket, and the consequences of Daniels' horrific descriptions of Stormy about, excuse the expression, Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what it does, which makes it feel like a reality show, is it feeds you something every night", said Burt Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "History for Sale", about the alternating cast of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns of the night.
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Place this week, it was bright outside with temperatures of about 80 degrees on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he closed in to watch MSNBC, and was recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't disconnect, not when Brett Kavanaugh was preparing to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
I remember the times when we did all these crazy shows in the past and people said, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Place told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.

External funding floods the midterm election race.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is facing a money spike, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which has resulted in two congressmen running for the same seat.
The district, a suburb of Pittsburgh whose boundaries were recently redrawn, put up Democratic Rep. Connor Lamb - who won his seat in another district - in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which largely borders the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the division of the previous districts had rendered the results unfair, and unconstitutional, in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District sparked a financial battle in the election campaign between the financial arms of the major parties, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March special election, which was widely watched, for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for over a decade, and President Trump won the district by a 20-point margin.
Political commentators predicted a slight Democratic lead.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, and then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Trump held a warm meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varla, in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until his partners expelled the Trump Company management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in response to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Norrett said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in aid from the United Nations in 2017, including drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt the Central American country, which suffers from high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed an emergency conference that was supposed to focus on security and economic prosperity as a continuation of a similar conference last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from reaching the United States.
But in mid-September, senior government officials made clear their desire to promote the convention, ending all consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a symbol of the importance the administration places on him, diplomats said.
And three American envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new messages or harsh penalties from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their explanations were confirmed by an outside analyst, close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying history
The next clear thing may come from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the alleged interference with Trump's investigations, for which there is now substantial evidence in public records.
Mueller is turning his investigation, according to reports, to whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attacks on our electoral system.
If control of Congress changes, Trump will find himself accountable to that body just as he prepares to face the voters again, and perhaps even a jury.
There are a lot of questions here that start with the question of whether or not Trump is going to fall, and I'm not going to argue that Trump's fall is inevitable - or that of his European counterparts.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have to make choices that will affect how long the struggle may last.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to stage a coup against Hitler if only the West would oppose him and support the Munich elections.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to prevent the years of carnage that resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The Americans are now facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since this newspaper reported last year that he offered to secretly record the president and raised speculation about his unsuitability for the presidency.
Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
How do we react if the FBI investigation into Burt Kavanaugh, recently requested, is not complete or fair - or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is upheld despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections and nominate a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter slumber.
But I believe we won't fail, because of the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had also occupied my luxurious home.
She survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later, sent me to light candles on Saturday on the same table carrying the cross.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Graham Durans of the Rangers is optimistic about the rapidly approaching Vienna
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on the 7th, and know that a win over Austria, after an impressive draw against Viral in Spain earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to be relegated from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the attacking Graham Durance from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Viral, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard to better performances.
"It was a good point for us because Viral are a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game believing we could get something and we got a point.
We might have won in the end but, all in all, the tie was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came out of the freeze in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they got a good result in their last game, but with the crowd behind us, I'm convinced we can push and get a positive result.
Last year was really tough, with everything that's happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but there's a good feeling about the place now.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on now, put the last season behind us and make it.
Women stay awake because of this fear about retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talked about it with their family.
About half of the respondents in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouse about the cost of long-term nursing care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take steps to have the conversation", said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Here's how we do it.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare the family for treatment if you do not express your wishes well in advance.
Ask your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get treatment, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining the cost.
Share your financial advisor: The advisor can also help you find a way to pay for expenses.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a sum of money that will help cover expenses, or self-insurance with your capital - as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: find an early resolution to legal battles at this opportunity.
Find and appoint a health authority, a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and make sure that the professionals fulfill your wishes in case you can't communicate.
Consider signing a power of attorney for your funds.
Choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and guarantee payment of bills if you are unfit.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications or allergies?
We put these details in a written plan to be ready.
"The financial side is not the only important point, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Get the plan ready.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palo, official sources said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
The disaster disrupted communications networks and aid officials could not get information from Dongola district, an area in northern Palo that was closer to the source of the 7.5 noise itself.
In Palo, over 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster struck.
Here are some facts about Palo and Dongola, in Sulawesi:
Palo is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was marking its 40th anniversary when the tsunami and earthquake hit.
Dongola is a province that stretches along over 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the district, an administrative region within the province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of income in the economy of Central Sulawesi Province are fishing and agriculture, especially in the coastal area of Dongola.
Another important source of income is nickel mining, which is concentrated mainly in Moravali, on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
Palo and Dongola have been hit several times by tsunami waves in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongola.
A tsunami also hit West Dongola in 1996 killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire, which is known for its seismic activity and is permanently affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra, on December 26, caused a tsunami wave that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coastline of the Indian Ocean, with more than half of the deaths occurring in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that shattered the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, causing a tsunami wave as high as 10 meters, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A landslide hit the province of Pidi Gya in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as locals remember the devastation following the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
The earthquake did not cause the tsunami in this case, but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, killing over 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily abandoned thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for assault.
Phelan, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, domestic violence reporting violation and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when Mina tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Patrial facility on $500 self-bail, according to a report by KTUU.
According to online reports, he appeared in court on Saturday, and he pleaded not guilty, of course, when asked to substantiate his claims.
Palin has been charged with three Class A misdemeanor counts, and as such, could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Exonerated Soldiers Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, tampering with a report of a domestic violence crime, and possessing a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he punched her in the face.
Groups of ex-soldiers criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Sunday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5, caused a tsunami wave and destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down and the loss rate is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos, distributed on social networks, show the moment of the impact.
Hundreds of people gathered to celebrate at a beach festival in Palo when the tsunami wave hit the beach.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in a New York City terror attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Seipulov, suspected of the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - a rare punishment not carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Sipew, 30, allegedly used a rented Hum DiPo truck to carry out an attack on a bike path alongside the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan, and beat up pedestrians and cyclists who ran into him in October.
To justify the death penalty, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov intentionally killed the eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty request, filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, you can seek the death penalty on both of these charges.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury sent Sayepov a 22-count indictment, including eight counts of murder-assisted extortion, which is usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required significant planning in advance and intention in the first place, the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipoff carried out the attack as "depraved, cruel and ill-mannered".
"Sepuloh Habibović and Saipov have caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicholas Clebs, Ann-Lore Dedd, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlig, Hernan Proucy, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damien Paniko", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last time the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty in a case was a decade ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express any feelings of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about his actions, police said.
Saifov told authorities he was inspired to attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
According to police, he also asked to hang a Daesh flag in the hospital room where he was staying.
He pleaded not guilty in response to the 22-section indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the lawsuit's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea that would lead to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Saifov's defense team has previously asked the plaintiffs not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Prag should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Prague vowed to recruit the People's Army today during a protest at the Conservative convention.
The former leader of the UKIP party said politicians must "feel the pressure" from the Eurosceptics - as Theresa May's Conservative MP argued that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would already be out by now if Mr Fragg was serving as Brexit secretary.
But the challenge facing May, the reconciliation of the highly divided Conservative lines, has been highlighted by the Remain Conservatives joining a different anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister has been struggling to keep her compromise plan, the Chequers, on track despite attacks from Brexiters, Remainers and the European Union.
The allies insisted that she would continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash - and force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her agreement and the Brexit vote.
Boone said at a Leave Means Leave group meeting in Solihull that he wanted to say goodbye to the Carrs.
He argued that Prague should have been accepted as a member and be responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
If he was in charge, we'd be out by now, he said.
MP Mullingborough added: "I'm in favour of Brexit but we need to say goodbye to the Chequers.
He emphasized his opposition to the EU and said: "We did not fight in two world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Boone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false".
Conservative and pro-Brexit MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: "I say simply: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chaker plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and with our activists who took to the streets and elected us in the first place.
Please, drop the chatter and start listening.
In a critical message directed at May, she added: "Heads of government keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Prague said at a conference that politicians should be made to feel the pressure if they are going to betray a decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
"It's now a question of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not allow you to escape its implementation.
He added, in a message to the enthusiastic audience: "I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel pressured.
We call upon the people's army of this country, who have given us the victory over Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.
At that moment, the Remainers marched in Birmingham and then held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved "conservative anti-Brexit" banners after the group was formed over the weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adkins mocked the Conservatives at the opening of the conference over the security problems they suffered with the party app.
"These are people telling us they can have IT systems and all the technology possible to have a deal like Canada Plus Plus, for frictionless border crossing and borderless free trade in Ireland", he added.
This is completely ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she'll seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently visits President Donald Trump, is running in the November midterm elections against Republican Jeff Deal, who served as co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of rumors that she might run against Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke, which took place on Saturday afternoon, is the 36th meeting with voters in a town hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government and for a woman to lead.
Arrest in the shooting death of LSU Sims.
Police in the Louisiana capital of Baton Rouge announced Saturday that the suspect in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Sunday.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson during a press conference at 11am ET.
Police released video of the shooting on Tuesday, and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the Southern University campus early Sunday.
Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died from it, police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, as reported by 247sports.
Wade tried to protect a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being in the area with weapons and gun in his possession at Wade Simms.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at Baton Rouge East County Police Department.
The 6-foot-3 junior played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton finishes with a world title after the team standings gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Voltaire Boutas was relegated to the next stage ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team standings would play an important role in the race.
Mann's first minute gave Boutas a good start and he left Hamilton almost alone as he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Wattell to attack his teammate.
Wattell went to the middle stop first and let Hamilton fit in with the competition's tail moves, a decision that was probably decisive.
The Mercedes team came to a halt a lap later and returned to the race behind Wettel, but Hamilton went ahead after a tight wheel-to-wire battle in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inner track to hold on without risk after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 21st birthday, started from the back of the standings and was seventh at the end of the first round.
He then led for much of the race and did not change tyres to get a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually came to a stop on lap 44 and failed to pick up pace for the remaining eight laps as Raccoon took fourth place.
It's a tough day because Voltaire did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman when he let me bypass him.
The team did an extraordinary job getting to the double, said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not leak a letter from Christine Blaisey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Burt Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to a convention in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and instead said that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are "bad and nasty and liars".
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's been happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people angry and mean and nasty and lying", he said.
When you look at the ads and the leaks and then they say, "Wow, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
You remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... Did you leak the document?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak.
So, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn't leak, he added while imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I did not withhold Dr. Ford's accusations, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to reports by The Hill.
She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept the letter a secret as she asked.
But the Senate denial didn't seem to be accepted by the president, who responded during the meeting on Saturday night: "I'm telling you, that was really bad body language".
Maybe it's not [leak], but it's the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president went on to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and claimed that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own ends.
They are determined to return to power at any cost.
You see the crimes, the atrocities, they don't care who they hurt, who they trample on their way to power and power", the president said, according to a Mediaite report.
Dundee Stars are 5-3 against the Belfast Giants.
Patrick Dwyer scored two runs for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss in the Premier League on Sunday against the Belfast Giants and won their next game 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Lions had an early lead on two away goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beuillaire.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney put their team back in business until Dwyer gave the linemen the advantage.
François Boucher remained tied for the Dents until two of Lucas Landwald Nielsen's exiles secured the victory.
This is the third loss of the season in the Premier League for Adam Keefe's side, who came from behind to beat the Dons 2-1 in Belfast, on Sunday.
This is the fourth meeting this season between the two teams, and the Giants have won the last three.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from a Kendall McPhail cook, and David Rutherford cooked up Buehler's goal by doubling the score four minutes later.
In a full first quarter, Sullivan returned the home team to play at 13:10 until Matt Marquardt cooked Cooney's equaliser at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead at the first half as he scored his second goal of the evening, at the end of the first quarter.
The home team was re-arranged and Bacharach again scored a goal that tied the game at 27:37.
Kauney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen give the Dents an advantage for the first time in the game, late in the second quarter, and Nielsen secured the Dents victory with a fifth goal, scored from the halfway point in the final quarter.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face their home opponent Milton Keynes in the next game on Sunday.
An air traffic controller sacrificed his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on board could escape an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was crowned a hero after sacrificing his life to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
Over 800 people have been killed and many are missing after a powerful earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Sunday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to hit the area and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But although many of his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gnawan Ongong refused to give up his position at the powerfully shaking control tower at the Mutiara-Sis-El-Jupri airport in Palo.
He stayed in place to ensure that Flight 6321 of the Baltic Air Company could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought he was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Seirat said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We set up a helicopter from the Balicapan airport in Clementon to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palo.
"Our hearts were broken to hear the good news", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as access to Dongola, Sigi and Butong is limited, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
"The death toll is expected to continue to rise as many bodies are still buried under the rubble and access to many others is not possible", said agency spokesman Satopo Porvu.
Waves as high as 20 feet have devastated Palo and the city will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and equipment.
Risa Cosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Ambulances are bringing bodies in every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelpand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working quickly to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and told the state troops: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN has reported.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by the Lombok earthquakes, which killed over 550 people.
Air New Guinea says one person is missing after plane crashes in Laguna
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed in the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, after previously stating that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a statement that as of Saturday afternoon, it was not in a position to say what had happened to one passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and other crew after the plane hit the water, while attempting to land at the island's airport.
Officials said on Tuesday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and all the others were stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events are still unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon a short distance from the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had lost track.
American passenger Bill Gaines said the plane came to a very low orbit.
"That's a very positive thing", said Gaines.
Gaines said he and the others managed to make their way to the emergency exits in the waist-high water of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew was stressed and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby on improving a pier also assisted in rescue operations, using a floating boat that brought people ashore before the plane sank in water some 100 feet (30 m) deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN) establish that 111 people have been killed in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but Air New Guinea was not involved in any of these incidents.
An analyst details the course of events on the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution proved its case Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Analyst Paul Reulet of the U.S. Department of Justice testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to connect the movements of the defendant, Quinton Tallis, 29, and the movements of the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, the night she was murdered.
According to the Clarion report to Dagger, Roult said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Tallis was with Chambers the night she died, thereby concealing his earlier claims.
When the data showed his cell phone was with Chambers's during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went out to talk to Sanford.
Sanford got on the stand and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was with Sanford that night, Sanford said he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed they'd only known each other a week.
Roult said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
He erased her from his life, Hale said.
The defense will begin with its closing statement on Monday, as planned.
The judge said he expects the trial to be referred to the jury later that day.
What is hip-hop conscious?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre and fill their music with positive messages.
The High Breed trio from Bristol, claim hip hop has moved away from its origins as a means of expressing political messages and attacking social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have been revived recently in the UK through artists like Akala and Oakey.
Another black man?!
A New York nurse sues a couple for firing her after a racist text message.
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an unsolicited text message from the mother who complained that the nanny was another black person.
The couple denied being racist and likened the lawsuit to blackmail.
Lyncy Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when she discovered that her new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"No more black man", Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
According to the New York Post, after noticing the mouthwash, Plasco-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the previous nurse, who was of African-American descent, had done a poor job, and that she now expected to hire a Filipino instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day's work and sent home with Uber.
Now, Morris is suing the couple for dismissal, demanding $350 a day for six months of work and living in the place they originally rented, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you don't do that", she told the Post on Day One, and added, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple fought back against the claims that they were racist, saying that terminating Morris's employment would have been desirable, out of fear that she would not be trusted after they had hurt her.
My wife sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist, her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you entrust your child to someone you were uncomfortable with, even if it was by accident?
Your soft baby?
Come on, now.
Flasco likened the lawsuit to "blackmail" and said his wife was due to give birth only two months before the incident and was "in a very difficult situation".
You want to go after someone like her?
"It's not nice to do that", added the investment banker.
The legal case is still pending, but the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, killing their behavior and the arguments they used.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers feared readers wouldn't recognize a talking bear
Bond's daughter, Karen Gunkel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine yourself in the shoes of someone who reads the book for the first time before it's published.
It's very amusing to know now what we know about Paddington's tremendous success.
After saying that her father, who worked for the BBC as a photographer before he was inspired to write the children's book Little Toy Bear, would have turned bloodthirsty over the postponement of his work, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was Merry-go-round, following his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of the success, in the end, of Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family".
He was a quiet man, not a proud man, she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you're proud of him even though it's not really your doing.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his own creation and his own imagination, he always said it was because of Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say hello on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Ned called regularly and said she was in a really bad condition, that she wasn't expected to last.
And then I got a call from Mende saying that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I said, Tasha, I love you so much, sweetie.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating was slowly disappearing and out of her system.
She died sometime before that and it's over, it's all over.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't clap or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people right now.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Adnan-Lapros, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers, unaware of the agonizing journey she had undergone.
No one would know, she said.
My head was racing, and tears were pouring in all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I had a tremendous sense of identity with Ned.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women mourning hanging signs on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide, working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hampreez have posted signs on the Walsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and he committed suicide at 18.
I don't want any other parent to feel like I feel every day, she said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Leidney, said his son was a promising chef with a catchy smile.
Everyone recognized him by his smile.
They always said his smile lit up every room.
But he stopped working before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly afraid of a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis created the signs so people would know there's someone to turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit in silence - you need to talk.
Mrs. Humphries, Mrs. Davis' friend of many years, lost Mark, her life partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
He didn't say he felt depressed or depressed or anything, she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was downstairs on Christmas Day -- when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything.
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but they got over it: it created a hole in the family.
It's tearing us to pieces.
But we all have to keep fighting.

The future of Bert Kavanaugh is on the line as the FBI begins its investigation into his death.
"I thought if we could really get what he asked for - a time-limited and limited inquiry - maybe we could bring about a unification", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "ripped apart" by the deep-rooted party deadlock.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not be interested in an FBI investigation?
Their deterrence is all about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans fail, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to get the man they want to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and met his wife, Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases his report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm his appointment to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean hostages under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byung-seok, citing data from South Korea's Ministry of Union, said the number of hawkers last year was 1,127, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the main reasons for this were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increased amounts of money being taken out of people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not made a public statement.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees eventually acquire South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, over 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, which has the longest and easiest border crossing for North Korea compared to the heavily guarded DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are technically still at war - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the negotiations that had been reached on the issue of nuclear disarmament.
The meeting came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where the two agreed in general to move towards an era when the Korean Peninsula would not hold nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and in such circumstances, there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm first", Ri said in his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi is calling Burt Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee "Historic" and said his character was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Plosey responded to this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever appeared like that, they would say "hysterical", said Pelosi about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.
Kawano has vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kawano was very emotional, and sometimes he would almost scream and choke when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the arguments against him "coordinated and grotesque character assassination" that was organized because of the anger of liberals over Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Quanno's testimony proved he couldn't serve on the Supreme Court because it showed prejudice against Democrats.
"I think he's self-deprecating with these statements and the way he's been going after the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Plosey hesitated when asked if she would try to oust Kavanaugh if his nomination was approved, and if the Democrats won a majority in the House.
"Let's put it this way -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not fit, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's on now", Pelosi said.
Kawano is currently serving as a judge on the federal court of appeals for the District of Columbia.
Plus, as a Democrat, she has concerns about possible Kavanaugh rulings against Obama's health care reform or the Roe v. Wade ruling, because he's considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearing, Kawano avoided questions about the possibility of overturning certain Supreme Court decisions.
"There's no reason for a hysterical, self-righteous person to come to court and expect to be told, 'Isn't that great?' " said Pelosi.
And women should use it.
It's a sharp criticism, months and years of anger are piling up on his shoulders, and she can't express them without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that rare, do you?
She went on, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager elsewhere, who said that she also cried when she got excited, but she developed a technique and whenever she got excited and started crying, she would tell the person she was talking to, "You might think I'm sad because I'm crying".
I'm mad at you.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as a source of anger, partly because they are not understood in their essence.
One of my most significant memories of my early life, working in an office with a male majority, is that I found myself crying in an unexpressed rage, and an older woman grabbed me by the neck, it was a cold manager that I was always a little afraid of -- and dragged me down the stairs.
Don't let them see you crying ever, she told me.
They don't know you're boiling with rage.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy that they've managed to depress you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and dropped out of the race, Schroeder, who was deeply frustrated, realized there was no reason she wouldn't consider running for president herself.
It wasn't a decision I thought about very carefully. She told me 30 years later and laughed.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another contender.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since she joined the campaign late, she's been a huge fundraiser, so she vowed not to join the race unless she raises $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
They think I'm getting a discount?
When she made the speech announcing that she would not open an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that was so focused on fundraising and focusing on voters rather than representatives, and anger at sexism - she choked on tears.
You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown, remembering the way the press reacted to her.
You'd think I was sponsored by Klink's.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my headstone?
Did she cry?
How the U.S.-China trade war might benefit Beijing
The opening targets of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the opening shot earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on China's important exports, including solar, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of the goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing has responded in the same currency each time, and recently raised tariffs by five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American goods.
China has pledged to retaliate for every blow the U.S. has delivered, and it's unlikely that the world's second-largest economy will give in any time soon.
A request from Washington to reiterate it would mean capitulation to its demands, but a public salute to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing manages to manage properly, the pressures from the trade war with the United States could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the onset of economic turmoil in either country is actually far more dangerous than India has ever seen in the past", said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate on the New American Security think tank.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to return refugees voluntarily and is calling for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by a long war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'amil said conditions in the country were improving.
Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to return the situation to normal.
All conditions are now in place for the return of refugees of their own free will to the country they left because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures, which are aimed at undermining their daily lives and livelihoods.
According to UN estimates, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'amil said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the regime would not receive conditional aid or aid from countries that funded the rebels.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the United States team with a final score of 16.5 - 10.5 at La Golf Nationale outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the crown again as Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Michaelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, sent his method T hit into the water in the 16th round of the par-3 and lost the game to Francisco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari is brilliant in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spitzer was defeated 5-4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjørn Olsen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's number one player, lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, which may be his last Ryder Cup appearance.
With a record of eight Ryder Cup appearances, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the European player with the highest number of tournament wins with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the trophy back.
"It's a team, and I'm glad I could help", Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his countryman John Ram who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the only game of the day.
"The enormous pride I feel, to beat Tiger Woods, which I watched growing up", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and his record now stands at 13-21-3, a career-high for the Ryder Cup.
It's a strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, ahead of only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find their way on the grass, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Captain of the United States team, Jim Furyk, spoke after the disappointing performance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we put pressure on Europe.
We failed.
Good for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna reorganize, I'm gonna work with the AGA and our Ryder Cup committee and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You should take your hat off.
We were defeated.
