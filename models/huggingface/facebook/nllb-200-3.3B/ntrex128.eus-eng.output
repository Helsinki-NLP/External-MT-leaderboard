Members of the Welsh Assembly have expressed concern that they will be treated as "puppets"
Some members of the Assembly have expressed displeasure at the suggestion that their office be renamed as MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The idea for the new Parliamentary Assembly came after the development of plans to change the name of the Welsh Assembly.
The policy-oriented members of the convention are worried that this plan will make a good laughing-stock of them.
A member of the Labour Party at the convention said this in English, "The new name rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
If you're from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means inozoa and pwp means kaka.
A member of the Scottish Parliament said the whole team was "not happy" and suggested they look for a replacement.
A member of the Conservative Party in Wales has said that he is open to new ideas for a name change, but has also expressed concerns about the implications of the changes to the MWP.
To understand this conflict, it is important to note that the Welsh w is pronounced similarly to the English u of Yorkshire.
The Assembly commission, which is currently drafting the legal name changes, said: "As for the Assembly members, they will be solely responsible for choosing the descriptors they wish to use".
The Welsh Assembly has the power to change its name by Act of the Welsh Government 2017.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation to select the proposed proposals and, in general, the Welsh Assembly received numerous expressions of solidarity.
As for the names of the members of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Members of the Welsh Assembly or WMP (in English abbreviations), but the name MWP was chosen in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly suggest alternatives, but it can be extremely difficult to unanimously choose an option; especially for the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who in a few weeks had to send a draft with amendments.
However, the legislation of the changes that will be made will affect the functioning of the Assembly; among other things, rules will be created to avoid activities that would cause the loss of good name of the members of the Assembly and the design of the Assembly system will be managed with the help of this law.
When the amendment of the legislation is discussed, the members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to finally decide on their own names.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is being held to resolve the longstanding dispute with Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long emphasized the designation of its neighbor to the north as a claim to its territory and has repeatedly resisted its request to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonia's president, Gjorge Ivanov, who is an opponent of the plebiscite to change the name, has said he will not be attending the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum (including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev) say it is merely the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Church are losing their ringing because of the problems of the other churches in Harlem.
"I have spoken to many elderly people and they have said for some time that you can find a bar and a church on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is nothing.
She says it's normal to disappear from bars.
"People use other methods to socialize", she explains.
"The taverns are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people used to gather".
As for the church, it is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough and that sooner or later we will be back to square one.
Also, churches can be replaced with housing and housing estates filled with people who don't care about the neighboring shrines will be built.
"The people who will buy the housing units will be white people", he says, "and that's why the churches will be closed very quickly because these new people are not members of the church congregations".
Both churches were built by congregations of white people before Harlem was a black metropolis; it was the Metropolis Community of 1870 and St. Martin's was built a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation that moved from the neighborhood in 1930.
After that, a congregation of black people took over.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by the black congregation of Reverend John Howard Johnson; Howard organized a boycott against the shops on 125th Street in Harlem, which did not hire or promote black people.
After a fire in 1939, the church suffered several damages, but the parishioners of Father Johnson designed several plans to rebuild the church and ordered the collection of carillons.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martin's, named the bell the "Poor People's Bell".
The expert who rang the carillon in July gave it another name: Treasure of Culture and Irreplaceable Historical Instrument.
Experts, Tiffany Hynek of the University of Michigan, also claim that it was the first ever carillone played by a black musician; the musician, Dionisio A. Lind, went to play the larger carillone in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather is explaining that St. Martin hasn't replaced his musician.
In recent months, St. Martin has seen the tiresome comings and goings of several architects and contractors; some of them brought in by lay leaders or the bishop-dioceses.
The parish council, on the other hand, sent a letter to the diocese in July to verify that the costs incurred by the hiring of these people would be passed on to the parish, as the parish had nothing to do with the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have filed complaints about the lack of transparency in the diocese.
A shark injures a 13-year-old boy while hunting for oysters in the California Strait
Police say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was hunting for oysters off the California coast on the first day of the oyster season.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m. on the Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming with a friend for half an hour on Saturday morning, but he heard his friend screaming for help, and then he swam with a group of people to help his friend out of the water.
Hamel thought he was screaming with joy because his friend had found an oyster, but then he realized that his friend was screaming "I've been bitten!"
I was bitten!
"I could see his entire clavicle", said Hammel, after seeing his friend.
"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water. There's a shark!" Hammelek shouted.
He has been taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego in unconfirmed condition.
The species of the attacking shark has not been detected.
Captain Larry Giles of the rescue team has submitted a report to the media, which says that a shark was seen a few weeks ago, but the species was not considered threatened.
Also, Giles's testimony indicates that the victim's wounds are located in the upper part of the sound.
Police have closed all access from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for a 48-hour investigation and to ensure the safety of the public.
According to Giles, there are more than 135 species of sharks in the ocean, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's supermarket plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's supermarket has taken over stores at Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and now offers department store-style beauty departments with a variety of expert and specialized staff.
While fashion and home goods sales are shrinking, £2.8 billion has been invested in the UK beauty sector which is growing without limits; larger beauty departments are being built and tested in 11 stores across the country and with good results, more stores will be opened next year.
Because of the investment in beauty, the department store can now tap into the TVs, microwaves and household appliances that were previously sold in the supermarket.
According to Sainsbury's supermarkets, they will double their beauty product offerings and offer more than 3000 products and will add Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw and similar brands to their customer base.
As for the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, they will have more space in branded areas, like the areas that can be found in Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket is reintroducing its Boutique brand of makeup, which is a completely vegan product; younger shoppers are increasingly demanding such products.
The brand will also be testing fragrance shop offerings at two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second, in Selly Oak, Birmingham, due to open later this year.
With online shopping and people buying groceries every day in small local shops, supermarkets have to work their asses off to attract customers.
Mike Coupé, the CEO of Sainsbury's supermarkets, said the outlets will adopt the style of department stores and the supermarket chain will reduce the threat of rivals Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's supermarket chain Argos has opened outlets in hundreds of stores and has opened several Habitats, after the two chains bought two years ago; as a result, the grocery sales have been strengthened and the purchased chains are more profitable than ever.
The department store, beauty and pharmacy department tried to reopen, but the strategy failed.
It then merged with Sainsbury's Boots in the early 2000s, but this partnership ended as the process of dividing profits from drug stores in supermarkets became burned paper.
A new strategy was put in place when the Sainsbury's supermarket sold its pharmaceutical business of 281 stores to Celesio, who owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
The Lloyds chain will have a role in the planned plan: it will add a large range of luxury skincare brands to the four stores; including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director of Sainsbury's supermarkets said, "We have improved the look and feel of our beauty departments so that our customers can find the perfect environment.
We have also hired a number of highly experienced staff who can give detailed product advice.
We have designed our brand range to meet all demands and, thanks to the environment and convenient location, our beauty departments offer a modern and easy option against stores that use outdated methods.
Peter Jones is upset that Holly Willoughby has rejected her £11 million bid.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, left "outraged" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cancelled an £11 million offer linked to her long-running brand business, saying she wanted to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, the brand that sells household goods and ingredients.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning used Instagram to announce her resignation.
Following the resignation of Holly Willoughby to accept contracts offered by Marks & Spencer and ITV, Dragons' star Peter Jones was furious at the show for leaving the lucrative business they had built together at the last minute.
According to our sources, a tense meeting was held at the Marlow headquarters on Tuesday, and as a result, Jones was furious when he heard our most famous woman on TV explain that she would be accepting new contracts worth £1.5 million and therefore could no longer spend time on Truly branded home products and components.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and doubled Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand business, Jones left the UK for a holiday home.
One source said: "Holly has always prioritized this opportunity.
A decision that will secure the future of the next two decades.
However, the decision to leave the mark has left us with a sense of wonder.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday night just before the closing of the auction.
Moreover, the warehouse of the Marlow Mansion is full of goods for sale".
According to experts, the company is on the verge of losing millions of pounds due to the departure of the presenter of This Morning (which is the most profitable presenter in the UK); the company has invested a lot of money in various products (including pillows, candles, clothes and household products) and now will have to face possible delays.
Besides, this conflict could be the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have three children and have been close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for a decade.
Willoughby and Capp founded the brand Truly in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as a director in March.
Both couples always plan their vacations together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source in Jones's group said last night that he would not speak about his business dealings".
It was a tough conversation, but then we fell in love.
He was joking about the bad words he had to endure due to the media, all for making a "inappropriate" comment about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given so much?
Trump used his "TV host" voice to respond to the chat:
"I have contributed nothing".
After their first meeting in Singapore in June, where Kim announced plans to host a second summit, President Trump has taken a historic step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
However, the process of nuclear disarmament has come to a halt.
Three months after their June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN: "At the UN General Assembly on Saturday, North Korea has not seen a 'proper response' from the United States regarding the country's recent steps toward nuclear disarmament.
Instead, the United States imposed sanctions in an attempt to keep the pressure on the country.
Trump, on the other hand, has a more optimistic outlook, which he expressed in his last speech.
"Our relations with North Korea are better than ever before", he said.
We were on the verge of declaring war on North Korea, after all.
It could kill tens of millions of lives.
But now, we have this extraordinary relationship between our hands".
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim were yielding good results, including the completion of missile tests, improved hostage release processes, and the withdrawal of the remaining U.S. military personnel.
He also shares his unusual perspective on his conversations with Kim.
"The job of the president is super easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to break into the country, we have 200 people here", Trump said as he pointed to the staff gathered there.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island and left hundreds dead
So, for example, after the Lombok earthquake, the help of international non-profits was no longer needed.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, the earthquake was not declared a national disaster (a prerequisite for requesting international assistance).
"In some cases, unfortunately, the government has made it clear that it does not need international assistance, so this is a challenging situation", Ms. Sumbung says.
Save the Children is assembling a team to go to Palú, but it is not yet clear whether volunteers can work in the country.
Mr. Sutopo, the representative of the National Disaster Management Agency, told me that Indonesian officials are working on the project to accept assistance from international agencies.
Although Indonesia has experienced several earthquakes, the country has undergone extensive measures to deal with the fury of nature.
Tsunami-resistant forts have been built in Aceh, but there are still too few forts on the coast.
Palu doesn't have a siren to warn people, and although the warning was on, that's why so many people died.
When the weather is good, traveling between Indonesian islands can be a challenge.
Furthermore, natural disasters complicate the efforts of implementing logistics.
A hospital submarine to provide treatment to earthquake victims was anchored in Lombok and is now on its way to Palua; however, it will take at least three days to reach the disaster scene.
President Joko Widodo's campaign was based on projects to improve Indonesia's infrastructure and has invested a lot of money to improve roads and railways.
However, funding has dwindled and President Joko's administration is in a tight spot as it prepares for next year's elections.
Mr. Joko also has trouble controlling sectarian tensions in Indonesia; for example, most members of the Islamic party have adopted a more conservative view of religion.
As a result, more than 1000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced as Christian and Islamic gangs have taken to the streets to wage their fighting using machetes, bows, arrows and similar weapons.
See also: the equaliser goal of Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge against Chelsea
On Saturday, a goal from Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London saved Liverpool's life in a Premier League match against Chelsea that was declared a draw.
Thanks to a pass from Shaqiri's 30-yard pass to the Cheal's, Sturridge had the opportunity to turn the score 1-0.
Before he could kick the ball against the door post, he put it to his left.
The kick causes the ball to fly off into the sand and then into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed through the defense of Kepa Arrizabalagá and entered the net.
"Sportsmen like Shaq always play on the top side, so I wanted to get that position to get the ball, so I tried to get enough time", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw it coming and with one touch, I had the ball at my feet; after that I didn't have much time to think. I just took the chance".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
In that play, the blue team forward returned a header to Mateo Kovacic, who turned around in the middle of the field and ran into the middle of Liverpool.
Kovacic was fighting in the middle of the field.
And then he kicked the ball back into the sand, right up to Hazard's foot.
Hazard breached the opposing team's defence and hit the ball into the goal post net with a left-footed kick that destroyed Liverpool's Alisson Becker's defence.
Liverpool's next match is against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will now face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Tuesday in London.
The death toll in the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster management agency said Sunday.
According to a press conference by representatives of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and waves of 20 feet high, several people were trapped in the rubble of buildings.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with building debris.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man for stabbing and then killing a woman in the city of...
A murder investigation has been launched after the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead earlier today.
The body of a 44-year-old woman was found with stab wounds at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street; a 32-year-old man has been arrested as the main suspect in the murder.
Police are asking people in the neighborhood if they see or hear anything, please contact the police.
Detective Brian O'Hagan says the investigation is just beginning, but if anyone saw or heard anything on John Street in Birkenhead, we'd like to get in touch with us.
We also want to ask for the cooperation of drivers of vehicles, such as taxi drivers, who may be recording, because the information recorded may be vital to the investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman was found dead in a house in Birkenhead.
Later that afternoon, several people who knew the woman arrived at the scene to find out where the body was found the next morning.
As the investigation continues, the police will contact the victim's family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews recently tried to break into his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When she heard about what had happened, she was stunned.
The neighbors will have to wait a few hours to get into their homes.
A policeman was talking to a neighbor and was indicating that the whole area was being considered as a murder scene.
Later, a woman came to the scene crying.
He kept saying, "This is horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police patrol cars entered the police line-up and another patrol car remained outside.
Several police officers have already searched the apartments in the building.
Anyone with information can send a message to DM @MerPolCC, call the 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers (0800 555 111) by simply mentioning the 247th registration on September 30.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament becomes the latest target of the "rewrite history" trend.
If it disappears, it will be a poetic justice, because just as the Taliban destroyed many religious monuments, the fanatical puritans in England did the same to many historical and cultural objects in that country.
The Cromwell Society, however, says that Mr. Crick's suggestion is a hoax and that he is "trying to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, the Cromwell Society's spokesman, said: "The controversy over the removal of the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace is inevitable; Cromwell has become an object.
Cromwell himself never requested or organized the Iconiclasm of the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps we should sacrifice another Cromwell for the deeds of his ancestor, Thomas, in the last century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's astonishing portrayal of Cromwell is part of the 19th century's popular imagination and our historiography, and many people still believe that this man's deeds should be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Fewer people believe this than in the 19th century, yes, but there are still many people who believe that Cromwell was a defender of Parliament against external pressures; in this case, of course, we are talking about the monarchy.
It remains the subject of historical debate as to whether this is an accurate representation of this person.
Nevertheless, we can say with confidence that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century was the starting point of the development of our country, and the famous Cromwell was among the parties who took part in that starting point.
The title 'Lord Protector' may also be a reason to celebrate and remember all the achievements he has achieved".
Pig kills by Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
A man with the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood in a pigsty at Liupanshu market in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in the city of Xinjing in the Qinghai province of China.
She usually travels through Yunnan province on Wednesdays with her cousin at the 15 pig market.
The next morning, his cousin found the body and found that the door to the adjacent pigsty was open.
He also stated that there was a large male pig in the pigsty with blood in his mouth.
The forensic report confirms that it was a pig worth £550 that killed the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and bruised", the cousin, whose surname is Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
According to the CCTV footage, Yuan can be seen entering the market at 4:40 am (Sunday) to feed pigs.
They found her body an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not a member of Yuan's or his cousin's family.
A market owner told the Evening News that the pig was kept in a lock to prevent further attacks and allow the police to gather evidence.
The Yuan family and market leaders are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, there have been reports of pig attacks in the past.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a £650 pig cornered a Welsh farmer in his tractor, until his wife drove the animal away.
In 2012, a farmer in Oregon was eaten by pigs and a farmer in Manitoba commented on CBC News that pigs are not aggressive animals, but if they taste blood, it can act as a "healer".
"They love to play.
They're like children, and they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show respect", he said.
Minor storms from Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
Weather permitting, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves toward the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, Rosa will bring heavy downpours across northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5:00 a.m., Rosa is expected to generate winds of 85 miles per hour, becoming a Category 1 hurricane.
And if they do, Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure point is forming in the Pacific Ocean and will move eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Also, on Monday Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain in some parts of Mexico.
After that, tropical humidity will combine with the low-pressure point to form heavy downpours in the days ahead to the southwest.
In local areas, 1 to 4 inches of water can be dangerous because of flash floods, debris flows and landslides that can occur in the desert.
Heavy tropical rainfall generated by moisture can leave up to 2-3 inches of water per hour in certain locations; particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
We expect water to rise by 2 to 4 inches in the southwest, particularly in Arizona.
As the tropical rains are nomadic, they can create sudden floods and conditions of erosion.
It is not advisable to go for a walk in the desert if a tropical storm warning has been issued.
Rains can turn canyons into raging streams and storms can bring winds and dust from the boulders.
In addition, the pressure drop will cause localized heavy rainfall along the southern California coast.
Due to rain, up to a half inch of water may collect and possibly create small debris streams and slippery roads.
This could be the first rain of the Shire's wet season.
There are also some sporadic tropical showers expected in Arizona on Sunday and Monday, but more showers are expected on Monday and Tuesday.
The showers will fall on the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
October may experience sharp temperature changes in the United States, as Arctic regions cool, but tropical temperatures will remain warm.
Occasionally these temperatures show large fluctuations over short distances.
For example, on Sunday there will be significant temperature changes in the central United States.
There is a difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the warmth of summer will come and spread all over the place.
Central and eastern United States warm summers, with temperatures of 80 degrees from the plains in the south to the northeast.
It's also expected to be in the mid-80s in New York City on Tuesday, which is roughly 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, the eastern United States will experience temperatures above average during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have seen Brett Kavanaugh's statement on the
More than 20 million people watched the Channel Six news Tuesday's shocking testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the latter of whom accused Kavanaugh of sexually abusing her in 1980.
Meanwhile, the political conflict continued and the network's anchors interrupted their regular Friday programming to bring you a last-minute news story that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had reached an agreement with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
From what Ford said to the Senate Judiciary Committee, he's pretty sure that Kavanaugh repeatedly touched her while he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh's defense was a passionate statement that he was absolutely certain that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, an estimated 20.4 million people watched the declaration on Friday.
The company calculated the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, this number was not immediately available to other channels that had issued the declaration, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching TV in offices.
For example, you can compare the audience to a football final or the Academy Awards.
As for Fox News Channel, Kavanaugh's statement is considered perfectly acceptable by the channel's hosts and averaged 5.69 million viewers while she was making the statement, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After hearing the statement, people's interest remained.
Flake was the center of the Friday drama.
After the moderate Republican Party announced it would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS recorded Kavanaugh surrounded by protesters on Friday trying to take an elevator to testify at the Judiciary meeting.
He was seen on CNN live looking down as protesters were arguing.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you really think he's telling the truth?
And he added: "You have a great power, but most women have nothing.
At that moment, and before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a notice and would provide more details during the meeting of the convention.
Cable and cable networks were broadcasting the hearing live every hour while the Judiciary Conference was voting for Senator Kavanaugh's nomination.
However, Flake said she would vote for him after a week of studying the FBI's case against the candidate, which was what the Democratic minority party was urging her to do.
After talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, Flack became almost confident in the investigation.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his final decision.
Flake's decision was powerful because the Republican Party doesn't have enough votes without the research to get Kavanaugh elected.
President Trump has ordered an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of "playing politics" as a basis for Brexit
According to an interview in the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses people who criticize her plans to leave the European Union of playing with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the country's interests.
29 September 2018 UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party's speech in Birmingham.
In another interview that appeared on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticised the plan, which he called a "game of cards" for Brexit and said the tax that Britain and the European Union would have to pay was "ridiculous".
Police have arrested Dyteon Simpson for the murder of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail for a second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The police shared a video of Sims and Simpson arguing, and according to the police, Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
According to the WAFB partner of CBS, the police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they had Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, he confessed to shooting Wade.
Her lawyer said her bail was set at $350,000.
The office of the District Court of East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report Friday in which the cause of death is reported as a single gunshot wound from the head to the neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Department's fugitive discovery unit, the State Police's Criminology Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the local community for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for their excellence and for upholding the rule of law.
Sims was 20.
The two-foot-three player grew up in Baton Rouge and his father Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and shocked by Wayden's death.
"These are the things you're always worried about", said Wade.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Pre-Casastrophe Center warned Mexicans on Saturday and recommended staying away from the volcano after several activity was detected in the crater; 183 gas and ash spills were recorded for 24 hours.
The other half of the volcano also experienced a tremor.
According to images on social media, thin layers of ash can be seen on the windshields of cars in some districts of Mexico City (e.g., Xochimilco).
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude-7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Fight between the police and the Catalan independence fighters before the annual vote
Six people were arrested this Saturday in Barcelona, after a clash between pro-independence protesters and riot police as thousands of people joined the parties in attendance to commemorate the first anniversary of the vote for independence in Catalonia.
A group of disguised separatists were stopped by riot police, but were then fired on with eggs and paint dust, resulting in dust clouds on the streets crowded with tourists.
More fights broke out later as the police were using their batons to stop the riots.
Similarly, pro-independence groups marched for several hours singing "We shall not forget, we shall not forgive" in front of the unionists who were chanting "Long live Spain".
According to local journalists, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the clashes.
There is a great nervousness in this territory that wants to find independence after the elections held on October 1st, which according to the government in Madrid were illegal, but the Catalan independenceists managed to get a day to celebrate.
Most voters voted for independence, but the turnout was very low due to the number of voters who wanted to boycott the election.
According to the Catalan authorities, 1,000 people were injured after the police attack, because the ballot boxes for the elections went to the places where they were to stop voters, causing violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
There was a demonstration, but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, is an electrician who went with his wife to the demonstration for independence, and said that there is no hope for Catalonia to achieve independence.
We had a wonderful moment last year.
My parents cried with joy that they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
After achieving a pyrrhic but important victory in the local elections last December, the pro-independence Catalan parties have had many problems this year to maintain the people's interest; several of the party leaders are exiled or have been arrested and are now awaiting a trial for organizing a referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, is recording the pro-police demonstration with her phone and says that politicians from both parties are to blame for our situation.
"There is more and more tension", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the leaders of Catalonia, who has been in prison since last year awaiting trial, stated that he would take part in the European Parliament elections scheduled for next year.
"If I present him as a candidate in the European elections, it will be the best way to denounce the reduction of democratic values and the repression of the Spanish government", he said.
London: Three men arrested for hitting a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested for driving their car into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent at 19:30 (BST) on Tuesday evening.
Inspector Bob Blemmings reports that the building and its gate were damaged.
Also, the car looks like it was hit with a crossbow.
A pitch from Menga gives Livingston a 1-0 lead over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal is a big one for Livingston.
Livingston's rise to the top impresses the Rangers and Steven Gerrard gets his second defeat in 18 games as manager at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's throw was crucial as Gary Holten's Hibernian team climbed the ranks in the second half.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premiership this season and will have to play against the leading Hearts (who have eight more points) next Sunday.
Before that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is undefeated with six games left in the season; Coach Holt doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's losing a lot of chances in front of the big-time visitors.
Holt's team had to take the lead before the goal was scored; his enormous correctness caused many problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but all his efforts were lost in front of the gate and then Alan Lithgow redirected his efforts to the door after Craig Halkett's headbutt.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play, but they knew the visitors could come any time.
And that was the mood that brought about the turning point.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston created an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to score for Menga, but the latter struck the ball and scored a goal halfway through the gate.
At this stage of the game the Rangers were dominating the property, but the home defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly passed the game without a problem.
This pattern continued into the middle of the second half, but the throw of Alfredo Morelos required Kelly's full skill.
Scott Pittman was unable to score a goal for Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow avoided Livingstone's other play.
Passes were repeatedly injected into Livingston's area and repeatedly taken out by the home players; two penalties were called, one for Halkett challenging the representative Glenn Middleton and the other for touching the ball with his hand, but both were dismissed.
The amazing play of Livingston
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
It was a power play for Livingston's with a perfect score.
These guys have been doing a lot of extra games for me and they've got a great chance of getting promoted.
The style of play and the team have hardly changed since their arrival in the first division, but Holt has been an extraordinary coach and has put the team on the right track since he arrived.
She had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett's work has been extraordinary in the creation and management of a defense that has been unmatched, and Menga has been able to keep Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall nervous throughout the game.
The Rangers weren't very inspiring, though.
They work very well when they're under Gerard's command, but they've all gone against the standards set by their coach.
The last play was too weak and they only defeated the home defense once, so the Rangers need to move fast if they want to be knocked out of the middle of the board.
Erdogan is receiving a hostile reception in Cologne.
There were smiles and blue skies on Saturday when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
They discussed a number of issues including the lack of human rights and press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Due to security measures imposed by the police, 25,000 people who wanted to gather in front of the mosque were blocked, but many supporters gathered around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protests (mostly Kurdish) united their voices to protest against Erdogan's policies and the decision of the German government to welcome the president.
The disagreements between the two sides were reflected in the president's actions by protesters on both sides, some Turks in Germany calling him a hero and others saying he is nothing more than an autocrat.
The Deptford Road accident: a cyclist died after colliding with a car.
A cyclist has been killed after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets at approximately 10:15 a.m. on a road that is usually congested to Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver pulled over and the ambulance arrived, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene.
On Childers Street, a mile from the accident on Saturday, another cyclist was killed a month ago and the driver ran away.
The Metropolitan Police Department is working to identify the man and alert his family.
Some roads have been closed and the usual route of bus lines has been changed; also, motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Six officers were wounded in a fight at Long Lartin Prison
Six prison officers were injured in a clash at a maximum security prison for men, the prison office said.
The riot broke out at the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at 09:30 BST on Sunday morning and has not yet ended.
A Tornado team arrived at the prison to end a riot started by eight inmates, which has so far been confined to one wing of the building.
The officers had minor injuries to their faces which were treated on the spot.
A representative from the prison service said: "The prison staff has been dispatched to put an end to the riots in HMP Long Lartin.
We've treated six workers for their injuries.
We will not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and those who started the riot will be handed over to the police and will probably spend much more time behind bars.
HMP Long Larsen Prison has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most violent criminals.
In June, the prison warden had to go to the hospital after an attack on a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, riots broke out in the prison, where the officers had to go to stop a serious dispute, because the detainees were attacking the workers with billiard sticks.
Hurricane Rosa has become a threat with flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dried areas may benefit some).
It is very rare to see a tropical storm in Arizona, but it is expected to be the same next week as Hurricane Rosa reaches its peak; it will visit the southwestern desert and is threatened with flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Friday, as the hurricane enters western Arizona and heads south and eastward into Nevada, passing through southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is going straight to Phoenix on Tuesday, but Monday's rains will delay her arrival.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted this: Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones formed within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status.
Katrina was a hurricane in 1967 that was 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the National Hurricane Center are for water to rise by 2 to 4 inches, and at Mogollon Ridge in Arizona, it's going to rise by up to 6 inches.
For some other areas of the desert southwest (central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, among others), 1-2 inches of water will collect; in isolated areas, 4 inches will collect at most.
For those who expect sudden floods, the rain of roses may be a blessing for the drought experienced by the region.
Floods are not to be underestimated, but I think these showers could be beneficial to the drought that the southwest is experiencing.
According to the U.S. Drought Control Service, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, which is the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will pass over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa will maintain its strength through Sunday morning and develop maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour, with sustained winds of 385 miles per hour south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and wind speeds of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, and as a result, its power is weakening.
It's expected to hit Mexico on Monday afternoon or night as a tropical storm.
With parts of Mexico experiencing severe thunderstorms, there is a high risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "rainfall will drop 3-6 inches of water from Baja California to southwest Sonora, and may reach 10 inches in some areas".
Rosa then passed through northern Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border as a tropical depression in the early morning hours of Tuesday; it then crossed Arizona and headed south into Utah on Tuesday night.
"The major threat of Rosa or its storm-like events are severe storms that will form in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert of the southwestern United States", the National Hurricane Center said.
These downpours will cause flash floods and dangerous debris flows in deserts and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested for attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with stab wounds in Somerset, England.
The teenager was shot in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4:00 a.m.
She was rushed to the hospital where her condition is stable.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested that night in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset, police said.
If anyone has any footage or any clues as to what happened with the phone, my colleagues have asked for her help.
Trump says Kavanaugh has to face the "senseless fury" of the Democratic Party.
"Our votes for Judge Kavanaugh are a rejection of the ruthless and irritating tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh had to endure the "inequity and wrath" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Tuesday, flatly refuting the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford, who said that Kavanaugh raped her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified after hearing her statement.
The president said on Saturday, "The people of the United States saw that day the courage, intelligence and quality of Kavanaugh.
"The votes for the election of Judge Kavanaugh confirm his having the best legal expertise of our time, a lawyer who has devoted his life to protecting public service", the president told supporters in West Virginia.
The president spoke not only about the nomination of Kavanaugh, but also about the importance of the Republican Party in this election.
"We have five weeks left to vote on the most important decision of our lives.
I'm not going to campaign, but I'm going to campaign".
"That's why I'm here, to fight on the side of the perfect candidates.
Trump also said the Democratic Party is using tactics to freeze and hinder the campaign.
A senior Republican Party official told CNN that the process for voting on Kavanaugh's nomination will be held in the Senate by Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll continues to rise
According to the authorities on Saturday, at least 384 people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, most of them killed as the huge waves washed ashore.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to celebrate a festival in the city of Palu, but at dusk six-meter (18-foot) waves washed ashore, dragging several people to their deaths and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"The tsunami warning was issued yesterday, but people were still on the beach doing various activities and did not immediately escape, which is why they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a representative of Indonesia's disaster prevention agency (BNPB) in an interview in Jakarta.
"The tsunami swept away cars, logs and houses and destroyed everything on the land", says Nugroh; furthermore, the tsunami traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 km/h (497 m/h) before reaching the coast.
"Several people climbed into the trees to escape the tsunami and survived", the representative said.
An estimated 16,700 people have gone to the 24 centers on Palku.
Several buildings and shops destroyed, a bridge destroyed and a mosque surrounded by water can be seen in aerial photographs taken by the disaster management agency.
Aftershocks continued to hit the coast on Saturday.
The quakes were felt in a region of 2.4 million people.
According to a report published by the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT), the energy level released by the major earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located in a long, narrow bay, may be related to the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroh described the devastation as "extremely devastating", with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels destroyed.
The bodies of several victims were found in the rubble of the destroyed buildings, resulting in more than 540 injuries and 29 missing persons.
Nugroho also said the death toll and the damage could increase along the 300 kilometres (190 mi) coastline of Palu, particularly a place called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter.
"The media in Donggala is not functioning and we have no information", Nugroho said.
According to the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people are in the area, and the organization's staff and volunteers are traveling to the affected areas to provide aid.
"It's a tragedy, but it could be much worse", she said.
On Saturday the agency received harsh criticism for failing to report the tsunami that devastated Palu, but according to officials, the waves appeared after the warning was transmitted.
In a video shared on social media, a man on the roof of a building is shouting "tsunami coming!" to warn people on the street.
A few minutes later, the wall of water hits the shore and drags the buildings and cars away.
Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the authenticity of this recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power cuts, and all communication on Palu was cut off. Rescue efforts were difficult to organize for the authorities.
Officials say the military has sent cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities to help, but food and supplies are still needed for the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened to facilitate relief efforts and will be closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia leaves more than 800 dead.
It's a tragedy, you know.
The World Vision workers from Donggala arrived safely in Palu city (the workers there have built wooden shelters in the organization's office yard), but they have witnessed firsthand the terrible situation left by the disaster, said Mr. Doseba.
He said, "They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses.
That's too bad.
While the support groups were engaged in the sad repair of the works in the cases of disasters, some complained that the experienced workers and helpers had advised not to go to Palua.
According to Indonesian law, international financing, supply and supply of labor can only be started after the zone is classified as a national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Arrianik, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says, 'OK, this is a national catastrophe,' we can open the doors to international aid, but it's not categorized as such yet".
The second night in Paule after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of those still missing had not lost hope in the unlikely miracle of their loved ones' return.
On Saturday, a small child was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday morning, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders who participated in the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
The others who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were students.
"As an expert in the world of paraphernalia, I have a very emotional burden to bear.
Gendon J. explained that in the parapentist community in the hours after the news about the fall of the Roa Roa Hotel was announced, he was sending WhatsApp messages to the competitors who were at the beach party.
However, his messages only got one gray arrow, no two blue dots.
"I guess that means that those messages were never sent", he added.
$26,750 was stolen by robbers while they were filling the ATM machines in Newport on the Leve.
Early Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Newport on the Brink ATM worker who was guarding an ATM, according to reports from the Newport Police Department.
The driver was emptying the ATM at the entertainment complex and preparing to deliver more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarthy in his briefing.
While working, another man "attacked a Brink employee from behind and stole a bag of money he was to deliver.
Witnesses said they had seen several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved.
If you have any information as to their identities, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, with the creature formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been using the adjective Ye for some time, and has used that adjective as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
He made the change before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, as Yandhi was not expected to present his latest album.
She replaced Ariana Grande on the show, who, according to the show's creator, was unable to attend due to "emotional reasons".
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has stated that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible (English) and it means word in the Bible", West said recently, talking to Big Boy radio host about the album.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
It's from Kanye, which means "just one more thing", to become a "Ye" - a reflection of our good, bad, confusing and all.
This work best reflects who we are".
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
We've known Sean Combs as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he's said he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator Jay-Z has also changed the dashes and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO has promised not to use force against its citizens.
Mexico's elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed not to use armed force or the military against the people as the country marks the 50th anniversary of the bloody repression against the students.
Lopez Obrador, sworn in Saturday at the Plaza Tlatelolco, vowed that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, who were mobilizing across Latin America to quell the rise of leftist students.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help Mexicans learn with monthly stipends and more free public universities.
He says that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drive young people into crime.
The U.S. should double its funding to AA.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments arose after various government departments in the United States issued statements regarding AI, despite the fact that the United States as a whole has no official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled a plan last year to make AI the best in innovation by 2030.
"A pair of AI research would be a good start, because other countries are far from the U.S. and we're just looking for the next AI discovery", Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of big AI discoveries in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has investigated one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked on an AA system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat America's top-notch Othello replicator and later served in executive roles at Microsoft Research, and was president of Google in the China area.
Lee spoke highly of the US government's previous technology competitions, including the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency's Robotics Competition, and asked when the next one would be, to help identify the next dreamers.
U.S. investigators often have to work hard to get government grants, says Lee.
"It's not that China is taking away the academic leaders, it's the companies", added Lee.
Facebook, Google and a number of other technology companies have recruited the brightest from universities to work with AAs in recent years.
Lee said that changing the immigration policy would also help the U.S. to promote AA activities.
"I believe that green cards should be automatically given to doctors at AA", she said.
The State Council of China issued the Next Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China and other government agencies fund people in academic institutions much like they do in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee says.
Earlier that year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brought together partners from industry and education, and the White House announced that it had formed the Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in their AI NEXT initiative.
Like NSF, it's currently investing over $100 million a year in AA research.
Meanwhile, the UK legislation for the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made progress in recent months.
Macedonians held a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The country of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday to change its name to the "ancient republic of Macedonia", ending decades of conflict that has blocked Greece's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which formerly included a province called Macedonia, still claims that its northern neighbors' name occupies its territory, and blocks its access to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but opponents of the nationalist view argue that the change is detrimental to the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic citizens.
President Gjorge Ivanov's announcement that he would not vote in the referendum and his boycott of the campaign raised doubts about the validity of the 50 percent required to win the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot was, "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership with the Greek deal?"
Those in favour of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say that it is worthwhile to get Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO as one of the countries created in the break-up of Yugoslavia.
"I have come to vote on the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it will bring us a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79 years old, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament have indicated that they will look to the outcome of the vote to be decisive.
Changing the name would require a three-thirds majority in the House.
The state election commission said there was no news of any surprises until 1 p.m. today.
However, only 16 percent of eligible voters cast ballots, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of eligible voters cast ballots.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62 years old, from the capital, Skopje voter.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in favor of changing the country's name and joining NATO and the European Union in the Macedonian referendum, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, had a small stage and a flight of stairs to prepare for the shops that wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join on our own terms and not through the server door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and be part of a Euro-Asian unification".
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership can bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of the people are in favor of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
In his words, saying bai would "confirm our future.
According to the poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Organization, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote - much less than necessary.
Another poll, by Macedonian TV Telma, showed that 57% of residents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent indicated that they would vote for him.
For a successful referendum, we need to get 50 percent plus one vote in favor.
If the referendum is a mistake, it will be the first major mistake in pro-Western policy since it began last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has broken through Brighton's defences to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overwhelmed all of Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero scored the goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine goalkeeper caught a pass in the middle of the field early in the game.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before he went into the open court.
Aguero suddenly found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
Threw a defender after he had escaped from several others on the sands of Brighton.
Then he made a left pass, and there was Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to Aguirre in the sand with a first touch, and he used his right foot to overtake Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-footed shot to the net.
"Every day he is overcoming several problems with his foot", City's coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he was going to play 55 or 60 minutes.
And we were.
We were so happy he scored that time".
But Sterling gave the blue shirts the early lead in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero, who was the ball catcher in the Brighton area, in the game.
He threw a great left-handed pass to Leroy San.
San made a few touches on the pole before Sterling was directed to the far pole.
The guy in the blue shirt pushed the ball into the net before he could get out of the line.
City will compete against Hoffenheim in the Champions League final on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the end for the Rockettes.
With the Nationals out of the competition, there was little reason to force a fresh start.
However, the ever-competitive Scherzer is looking to take advantage against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the Rockies still experience the effects of the tie, which still gives them a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West competition.
The Rockets have secured at least a commodity by defeating the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, but they still have to try to win their first ever major-league title.
"Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we know that the Denver atmosphere is going to be packed, and the opposing team will be playing at the best level in every area we'll be facing this year.
Why wouldn't I be in that business?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher, but in this situation, they're going to let Scherzer pitch.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, pitched a practice session on Thursday and it looks like he'll be pitching on Sunday.
The right-hander in Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's statements from West Virginia
The president took a cursory look at the situation and referred to the situation surrounding his own Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, when he was speaking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
One of the big ones is -- I'm not a candidate, but I am, in fact, and that's why I'm in all the places where the big candidates are competing, that's why I'm in all the places where the big candidates are competing".
Trump added, "You can see the incredible group of Democratic extremists, you can see what's happening right now.
And they will not hesitate to use whatever means are necessary to remove power, see greed, see inequality.
"We're not going to give them that".
The Democrats, she said, are aiming for "disruption and obstruction".
"As you have seen in the last four days", he said, adding that the Democrats are "angry and cautious and disgusting and fake".
She signed up Democratic Party Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, who received shouts from the audience.
Do you remember what he said?
Did you leak that document?
Hey, hey, what?
No, oh, no, I'm waiting for someone -- that's wrong body language -- that's the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labor Party will no longer have access.
He's intolerant of those who say what they think.
When the activists of my local party, Momentum, voted against me, it wasn't a huge surprise.
I am, after all, the last person on the list of those who were not welcomed by the Labour MPs for saying what we all thought.
My MP in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar fashion, because she spoke out in support of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion for censorship was criticizing me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy on national security in Europe, Jeremy was at odds with his predecessors on all sorts of issues.
The news coverage of Friday's East Nottingham meeting said "We want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
During my eight years as a local Labor MP, Friday night GC meetings have been all that.
Unfortunately, the word "politically friendly" is rarely remembered today, if at all.
It is becoming clear that within the Labour Party there are different views and that the views are judged by whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
It started when Jeremy became the leader, when the members who shared the same political views before started to turn around and demand that we accept views that I would never have accepted - both on national security and on the UK's single market.
Every time I spoke in public - no matter what I said - a lot of things happened on social media denouncing the center policies and demanding that I be removed from the center, the harassment, the harassment, from people saying I shouldn't be in the Labor Party.
That's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because I know that the views that are thrown at me are political.
I am dependent on friends who every day face the harassment of sexism and racism with professionalism and integrity, but never with shame.
One of the unpleasant aspects of the current politics is that the current level of harassment is seen as normal.
Jeremy Corbyn, last week, said that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is, we don't get a single opinion on every motion of no confidence or party rule that gets tighter.
Over the last two years, I've had so many and so many messages telling me to keep my head down, not talk so much, and that way, I'd be fine.
But that's not what I'm in politics for.
32 years ago, as a student, prompted by the indifference of the Thatcher government, I left the classroom and entered the public service where I was most needed - as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political beliefs, not in the last edition.
No one in East Nottingham will have any doubts about my political views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
I would like to say to the backers of Friday's motion that while the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand it to be a waste of time and energy to debate my loyalty to the Labour Party leadership.
But my real message is not to push Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether you're a member of the Labour Party or not, I'm very proud to work for you and I promise you that I will not be deterred from continuing to work for what is in your best interests by threats or political expedients.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Ayr 38-17, Melrose, and the leader is Ayr, who has not yet lost a game.
The final two unexpected attempts somehow altered the final result, but without any doubt, Ayr deserved victory in the fantastic and fun Tennent Championship Match of the Day.
They are on the top of the table and are the only team that has not lost any of their ten games.
But the defense was better, and the chances were better, and the home team and coach Peter Murchie have every right to be excited.
"We have been tested so far and have not lost a single one, so we must be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose added, "My tribute to Ayr, who used his chances better than us".
Grant Anderson's 14-minute practice, performed by Frazier Climo, preceded Ayr's, but the yellow card from Scottish captain Rory Hughes, left by the Warriors for the game, allowed Melrose to add points and Jason Baggot failed to perform the practice.
Climao had previously blocked Ayr's lead with a penalty, and at the end of the first half, he had a solo practice and Ayr went 17-5 to the break.
But Melrose started brilliantly in the second half and Patrick Anderson's improvement, orchestrated by Baggot, reduced the gap by five points.
Then there was a long suspension due to a serious injury to player Ruaridh Knott, who was pulled out of hand-to-hand and, upon his return to play, Ayr came further when Stafford McDowall's rehearsal was converted into Climo.
Then, when Ayr captain Blair Macpherson got his yellow card, Melrose again benefited from having one more man, which didn't happen with Bruce Colvin's rehearsal in the live finale.
The home team returned and, when they gave Struan Hutchinson a yellow card for interfering with Climo's lack of a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson touched the ground behind the Ayr team's maul as they were advancing.
Climao scored, as he had done almost from the start, and Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's underhand and Greg Henry's wing off in the fifth home run.
The star of the "Still Game" series is about to begin a new career in the restaurant industry.
It seems actor Ford Kieran is looking to jump into the hospitality business after it emerged that he has just been named CEO of a chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, for which he is the writer and star, alongside longtime partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the show will end with the next season, the ninth, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress has declined to comment on the story, although sources at the Scottish Sun magazine said Kiernan was "trying to get into one of the top restaurant chains in Glasgow".
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia hopes the courts will reopen the passage to the Pacific
Marine patrol, marine equipment support headquarters in the La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
On the ships' bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the following slogan can be read: "The sea is ours by right.
It is our duty to recover it".
Throughout the interior of Bolivia, the bloody 19th century conflict along the coast of Chile still rages - as the natives yearn to sail into the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes are perhaps stronger now than in recent decades, because Bolivia hopes that on October 1st, after five years of deliberation, international tensions will be resolved.
"Bolivia is living a good moment, with a sense of unity and calm, and of course, we are waiting for the result", says Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the international court's decision through giant screens distributed throughout the country, with the hope that the Hague Court will give Bolivia's demands justice - after decades of negotiations - forcing Chile to negotiate with Bolivia over its sovereign access to the sea.
The charming Evo Morales, the indigenous president of Bolivia - who is determined to be re-elected next year - also made several contributions to Monday's resolution.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean", he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia and therefore, not much will change.
The United Nations organization based in the Netherlands has no authority to cede the territory to Chile and has indicated it will not make a decision on the outcome of any negotiations that may be held.
The fact that the International Court of Justice's decision came six months after the negotiations ended indicates that the case "was not difficult", according to Paz Zarat, a Chilean expert in international law.
And instead of promoting the Bolivian cause, they have been backing away for the last four years.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken as a captive by the current Bolivian administration", Zarathe said.
President Morales' belligerent rhetoric has destroyed all the will in Chile to do the right thing, he says.
Bolivia and Chile still have issues to address, but it's going to be very difficult to continue the debate after this.
The two countries haven't exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The previous president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, disagrees with those who claim that the court's decision is particularly quick.
On Monday it said Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to re-establish relations with Chile" and "end 139 years of disagreement, for the benefit of both".
Calzadilla expressed disagreement with those who say Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in South America - is using the sea issue to gain political support.
"Bolivia will never relinquish its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The decision is the opportunity we had to see to overcome the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it believes the U.S.
North Korean Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country is not disarming until Washington can believe it.
Rick said that in a statement to the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States at the Singapore summit, in the presence of the leaders of our adversaries, to keep their promises.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's comments came after Singapore's meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un for more than three months was on the verge of blocking nuclear diplomacy once again.
Rik says it's "utopian" to think that continued sanctions and US obstruction of the declaration ending the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington doesn't want a confession before Pyongyang makes moves to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want the second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the country's apparent security as the only way to guarantee its security by relinquishing all weapons.
Pompeo's plan is to travel to Pyongyang next month to organize the second summit between Kim and Trump.
She's at the Paris Fashion Show. On the high street next to you, she's showing off her latest line of mass-produced hats.
Whether you're looking to add to your hat collection or to block out the sun entirely, here's the answer.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne introduced a series of large-size jewelry hats in the spring-summer 2019 collection, which shook up the style shown at the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, some very impractical hats have been on Instagram, and these designers have brought their spectacular designs to the lobby.
Valentino's most prominent piece was the beige-colored hat with feather-like fin covering the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include a jewelled angur, a somewhat rare hat, and even a pine cone - but not for warmth of mind.
Thom Brown also exhibited his collection of bizarre masks just in time for Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks have lips sewn together and look more like Hannibal Lecter's than a high-class tailor's.
One looked like a scuba mask with goggles and a tube, and the other was like a popsicle.
If you're a fan of fashion, I have some good news.
I'm not sure. I've heard from fashion experts that deaf people will be on the streets, even in your own neighborhood.
The big hats are following in the footsteps of "La Bomba", the two-foot wide-winged straw hat that has been seen on countless celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat that has been a hit on social media has brought another object to the aisle - a beach straw bag, almost as big as the swimsuit model she is wearing.
The orange-colored raffined bag, cut with a raffinch and finished with a white leather handle, has been the protagonist of Jacquemuse's La Riviera 2019 Spring-War collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage said on FEMAIL: "I hope that big hats and big beach bags will hit the main streets next summer, with the huge response the designer has had it would be difficult to ignore the huge demand for accessories".
John Edward: Basic language skills for a global citizen
Independent schools in Scotland have made records of academic excellence, and have continued in 2018, with exceptional examination results, which have been reinforced by outstanding individual and team results in sports, art, music and other community projects.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the best possible service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for higher education, for the career they choose, and as citizens.
As we as an education sector can design and implement personalized school curricula, we've found that modern languages remain the most common option chosen by students.
Nelson Mandela said this: "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, you get into their head.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart".
It's a powerful way to remind us that in order to build relationships with people in other countries and gain their trust, we need to use more than just English.
From the results of the last year's examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the most successful in the independent schools.
68% of foreign language students have achieved the highest A grade.
Data collected from SCIS's 74-student school shows 72 percent of students received the highest A grade in Mandarin Chinese; 72 percent in German; 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland see foreign languages as an essential skill that young people and children will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now being developed as a core subject (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the European Commission found that one of the main reasons for filling the position was language ignorance.
More and more, knowing languages is becoming essential to preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Whatever career you choose, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with that lifelong advantage.
Being able to talk directly with people in foreign countries automatically puts the English-speaking person at the top of the competition.
A 2013 survey of 4,000 adults in the UK by YouGov found that 75% could not speak a foreign language to have a normal conversation, and among those who spoke only French, the figure rose to double digits, 15%.
That's why it's so important to invest in language teaching for today's children.
Speaking more than one language, which is mostly used in developing economies, will give your children a better chance of finding a better job.
In Scotland, schools are distinguished according to the language in which they teach.
A number of students prefer more classical modern languages, while others prefer those that are likely to be important for the EBA by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests are, there will always be a wide range of language learning options in an independent school with teachers who are experts in the field.
The purpose of independent schools in Scotland is to prepare and equip children to succeed in the future in different departments.
We cannot deny this now, in an international business environment where languages are vital to the future of the country, so education must reflect that.
In fact, modern languages should be understood as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer Scotland's youth their choice, diversity and excellence.
It must be done well.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Monday in San Diego.
The fans' wait is finally over for LeBron James, the world's biggest star, to make his debut in Los Angeles.
Lakers head coach Luke Walton said that James will play in Monday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But he hasn't said how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than one and less than 48", is Walton's quote on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would be playing on a limited schedule.
After practice this week, James was asked about the Lakers' schedule for the first six preseason games.
"I don't need a pre-season game to prepare for this stage of my career", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally High, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will kick off the campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first of five rallies Trump is scheduled to attend next week, and he will visit several places that he has made friends with, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Waiting for a vote that would give him a re-appointment to fill the Supreme Court seat, Trump is seeking support for the midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November elections.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia today, and how much can you watch online?
Trump's West Virginia tour is scheduled to begin at 7:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia live on YouTube.
It seems that Trump will be directing this week's Supreme Court nominated Brett Kavanaugh hearings on your sexual misconduct status while the FBI investigation continues until we get confirmation from the Senate, which has voted to uphold the nomination.
But the main purpose of this rallying tour is to help the Republicans win some votes in the November election.
So, President Trump's campaign says these five rallies next week are aimed at reviving the volunteer movement and helping the Republicans maintain their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives.
"The congressional contract is of utmost importance and the president will travel to as many states as possible as he enters the campaign", said a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be identified.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, today's rally will allow coverage of fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media in Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia in the past month, the state he won by 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Senator Patrick Morrisey of Virginia, who is stalking him.
It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to go there to help his campaign, says Simon Header, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA will try to stay in the singles competition on Sunday
After three innings of one-sided play, it seemed that the Saturday afternoon foursome was just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The key to the moment is a completely invented concept of sport in which the players believe, but not for other competitions.
So, where do you say the moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now they have four, so I guess now is the time, sort of", said Jordan Spieth, in the one-day field.
Of course, Europe leads with four points out of the 12 in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel the wind is not in their favor and they need help, especially Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together and got three out of four.
Spieth is decisive from tie to green and he's leading by a wide margin.
Those celebratory shouts have been louder and louder as the rounds progress, and he's completed a key putt, winning four all-squares, after Thomas lost two after two.
He celebrated with another shout similar to the putt he won in game 15, which signified that the American team was not out of the competition.
"You must find your strength and concentrate on your game", Spieth said.
It's what they've got left.
18 holes to the side.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, both Ryder Cup players.
The special yet charming European couple are four in four who have sworn to fail.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't throw a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine on Friday.
That shift and the energy that flowed from the crowd and into the crowd made them the pair that had to be overcome on Sunday and there was no European player more famous than Fleetwood and Molina to seal Europe's victory when the sun rises in Le Golf National.
You two better do it in separate holes.
It's still too early to talk about great Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have stepped up the pace of Sergio Garcia, the best of the four, as he battled Alex Noreen.
Bogey one and two double-ahead on the hole that was never too close to defeat the Spaniard and the Swede.
But still, on Sunday night, there was no one to help you out of your hole.
The four were fascinated by seeing up close the interaction between these couples, the advice they gave and what they didn't give, and how you can change strategy in an instant.
Europe played better as a team and had a clear lead into the final, but the quartet's performance showed that the USA had the courage to fight, even though some, particularly the Stateside, were questioning it.
Europe leads 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final.
Europe has a clear lead in the Ryder Cup final after Saturday's foursome won 10-6 against the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari scored two victories against the desperately trying Tiger Woods, and took all four of their valuable points so far at Le Golf Nationale.
Thomas Bjorn of the European side, who was trying to regain the trophy he lost to Hazelin two years ago, was the dominant player in the morning, and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered greater resistance, winning two games, but not enough to overcome the gap.
They needed eight points from Fury's side in 12 games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the only European rookie to win four consecutive points and along with Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a great weekend, they are second in Ryder Cup history to win four points in four games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball, he perfected the game against the tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau, who they beat 5-4 in the light.
Woods, after playing two games on Saturday, showed touched brilliance, but lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursometre, 7 in a row.
Justin Rose took a break for the morning fourball and then came back with Henrik Stenson in the fours to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2&1 - the world's best and third.
Europe was lost in the pleasant, cool day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spiethe and Justin Thomas set the American record for the two-point mark on Saturday.
They won a 2-1 blurred victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourball and then overcame Poulter and Rory McIlroy in fourball as well after losing two opening holes in 4&3.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to overcome the four-point gap and make it to the singles, although Furyk's side only needed a draw to retain the trophy.
After being the second best in two days, after the counter-attack on Sunday, they're going to put him ahead.
North Korea has issued a no-show without any commitment to disarmament.
North Korea's foreign minister advised the United Nations on Saturday that sanctions continue to undermine confidence in the United States and that under these circumstances they will not, under any circumstances, stop building nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong-ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "meaningful, good-faith steps" last year, such as suspending nuclear weapons and missile tests, abandoning nuclear test sites, and pledging to stop developing nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we do not see any adequate response from the US side", he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under no circumstances can we lay down arms first".
Rik echoes familiar North Korean grievances about Washington's resistance to a two-stage process toward denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking incremental steps. His statements seem indicative given that he has not ruled out unilateral denuclearization in Pyongyang in the past.
Rik refers to the first summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, the US president and the North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to denuclearize the Korean peninsula, and Trump vowed to ensure North Korea's security.
While North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, the United States has said Pyongyang must first lay down its arms.
Washington has ignored international calls for sanctions relief against North Korea.
"The US reiterates that it must first lay down its arms and continues to increase the level of sanctions pressure to achieve their objective of coercion, which is contrary to the declaration of the end of the war".
"The idea that the Cigars will turn us over to them is the utopia of those who do not know us.
The problem is that the continuing punishments only increase the mistrust.
There is no mention from Rick about the second Kim-Trump summit announced by the US leader earlier this week at the UN.
The minister, however, referred to three meetings in the last five months between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in and added, "If the other side were South Korea instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be blocked".
However, the tone of Ri's speech would have been completely different from last year, where he stated at the UN General Assembly that North Korea was inevitably targeting the US after Vice President Trump called Mr. Kim a "missile suicide mission".
This year, in front of the United Nations, Trump, who had vowed to "demolition" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking the first steps to disarmament, but said that it still had to be done and that sanctions would continue until North Korea was completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump stated he "didn't have the time to do it, whether it's two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council sanctions must be continued without fail until we have verified that the denuclearization is a reality".
The Security Council has unanimously endorsed the sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly in Bilbao and then indicated that he would visit Pyongyang again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has made three visits to North Korea this year, but the last one didn't go well.
"When he came back from Pyongyang in July, he said he had achieved something for North Korea's peace after hours of complaining that he was making gangster-like demands".
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon that they would abandon missile sites and a nuclear complex if the United States took the appropriate steps.
Kim told him he was looking for "their own measures" in the security guarantees Trump promised Singapore and spoke of moving toward normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students recently took a course on getting enough rest.
This year's class at Harvard University will be receiving more sleep from undergraduates, trying to counter the increasingly popular culture of coffee-drinking students.
A professor recently observed that students at the best universities in the world are losing their grades in basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospitals, designed the course which he believes is the first of its kind in the UK.
The course began when he gave a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation during the school year.
'At the end, a girl came up to me and said, "Why do I have to do this only now, in my senior year of school?"
She said that no one had told her how important it is to sleep well, which really surprised me".
The course, offered for the first time this year, focuses students on the impact of good sleep habits on academic and athletic performance, in addition to improving their well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of university health services, stated that the university decided to launch the course after students noticed that they were sleeping less during the week.
The long-term course consists of several interactive sections.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room where students press coffee pots, curtains, coaches and books to see the effects of caffeine and light, and the effects of insufficient sleep on sports performance, and the importance of bedtime habits.
In another section, participants were told that too little sleep could increase their risk of heart attack, depression or cancer.
A campus map, using interactive icons, invites participants to reflect on their daily habits.
'We know that we can't change the habits of the students all of a sudden.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the effects this will have on your health if you choose to smoke", added Czeisler.
There is still a culture of "doing too much", she says, and the growing pressure of modern technology on students exacerbates the problem of not doing enough.
Getting enough, quality sleep, should be the secret to dealing with stress, fatigue, nervousness -- and also to gaining weight, she said, because sleeping too little makes the brain feel hungry and we'll always be hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical biology and physics, has assisted Professor Czeisler in designing the course, and in his first year at Harvard he attended one of his first classes.
She said that the course opened her eyes and encouraged her to participate in a course that was held on campus.
The next step, she hopes, would be to ask all the graduate students to do a similar study before they join a competing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students have an alarm to determine when to go to bed and wake up, and to recognize the heating effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter circadian rhythms and cause sleep problems.
The Rangers have been beaten by the Gerrard men.
The Rangers suffered another defeat, as Dolly Menga's strike set the score to 1-0 for Steven Gerrard at Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking to win for the first time after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holte's side contributed to the Gerrards' second team defeat in his 18th game as coach, allowing his eight points to the Landbrokes Championship-leading Hearts to get out of control.
Menga's strike was seven minutes before halftime, and Rangers' strike didn't make the tie.
The Rangers have dropped to sixth, Livingston has climbed to third and they're only three points behind Hibernian.
The problem could have been made worse for the Rangers, who had to treat Calum Spence's wing for a head injury that they claim was thrown from outside after being struck by an unidentified object.
Gerrard made eight substitutions and Ayr made it to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, was joined by Livi 11, who took a point off the Hearts last week, and he'd be happy to see his well-polished outfit choke his opponents every turn.
The Rangers took control of the property, but Livingston was more profitable to their games.
A goal from Scott Pittman on the wing of the Menges, passed by Allan McGregor, should have been scored but the midfielder did not take advantage of the opportunity.
A deep free throw from Keaghan Jacobs found captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow only managed to push him away to the back post.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third, as far as their play went, it seemed like the hope was greater than the belief.
Alfredo Morelos felt that there should be a penalty on the quarter-finals when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's appeals.
Rangers managed to make only two outs in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's light-hitting.
Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have damaged the course of the game, but one cannot deny that it was worth the effort.
Again the Rangers failed to stop a play that would stop Jacobs' ball.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who casually chose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard stepped in at halftime by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and the change had an immediate effect as the winger passed Morelos, but the terrible Kelly ran over his own line to block.
But Livingston continued to force the outfielders to play their game, with Lithgow and Halkett playing long after long passes.
Holt's team had a chance to increase their lead, but McGregor held firm before Lithgow's head-butt from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again called for a penalty in the end when he was stuck with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and TODAY... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity: this invention was followed by what is now known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a landmark of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" starring the unlikely-to-be-scientists cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms caused by the radioactivity of minerals.
Evans: Yeah, we're watching it right now.
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days short of his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect malignant cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to target and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and then alter them in the laboratory.
Then they can look at a protein that's common in many cancers and then re-inject it.
The vaccine in the trial is showing very good results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was given a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, her ovarian cancer was eliminated for over 18 months.
This is the basic method of taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in the lab to look for a protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then re-injecting the gelatins.
Jay Berzofsky of the United States National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a vaccine with great promise".
HER2 is "linked to the growth of several types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon and rectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to how we take immune cells from patients and how we get them to target these carcinogenic gels has worked in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West went into a pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAG hat, after the SNL appearance.
It didn't work out.
Kanye West was shouted at the studio on Saturday Night Live when he praised Donald Trump as President of the United States and said he would run for president again in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a Make America Great hat, he began to speak ill of the Democrats and reiterated his pro-Trump stance.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they say, 'Why do you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, West's insulting speech was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear whether Rock West was trying to ridicule the publication.
West also publicly complained about his bad luck in the wings, most notably his hat.
"I've been torn between the wings.
I've been told, 'you can't go out with that hat.'
They attacked me!
And then they say I'm in a place that's been hit by the bottom", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the place that collapsed?" He said, "I'm going to wear my Superman coat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Taste the love".
Her comments caused at least a couple of whistles to come from the audience and the members of the SNL show seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, and a person who was there told the magazine: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was brought in at the last minute to replace Ariana Grande, who had been murdered by her boyfriend, rapper Rac Miller, a few days earlier.
A lot of people were shocked by the Web with her performance of the song I love it, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted, "Inspired by one of the bravest spirits: SHOWING THE MAFIA AGAIN".
But as the talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted, West was simply "being himself and that's great".
"But I do NOT want to reward a person who embraces an ideology that is harmful to the community (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their culture)".
He's on the loose.
And so are we", he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the late music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and became the artist he was by then Prince.
Charged with attempted murder for stabbing a man in a restaurant in Belfast.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed to death in a restaurant in Belfast's east end on Friday.
The incident took place at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is scheduled to appear in the First District Court of Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution is going to review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has spoken out against toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones on HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor has spoken out against the stereotype of the hero-rival, saying that the introduction of such roles on screen has made young men feel that they must be tough to be respected.
In statements to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Kit said he thought 'something has gone wrong' and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the era of #MeToo.
Kit also recently married Game of Thrones star Rose Leslie, 31, and admitted that he is 'convinced' that the problem needs to be addressed.
"Personally, and with great conviction, I think at this point in time -- what did we do wrong with masculinity?" she said.
'What have we been teaching men as they grow up, given the problem we see now?'
Kit also believes that television may have a part of its responsibility for the rise of toxic masculinity, as a result of its overly masculine characters.
She went on, 'What is natural and what is taught?
What is this school of thought on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to make this kind of manhood their own?
I think that's one of the most important issues of our time. How do we change that?
Because clearly something has gone wrong for these young men".
He also admitted in the interview that he would not make a Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series ended next summer, and said he was 'finished with battlefields and horses'.
Starting in November, Kit will be back in Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose is the best thing Game of Thrones has ever given him.
'I met my wife on this show, and she gave me my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the woman who is in love with Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases in the last two weeks.
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS in its country.
More than 820,000 people in the country are affected, health officials say.
More than 40,000 new cases were recorded in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in certain areas of China from contaminated blood transfusions.
But in this way the number of people who were infected with HIV was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people in China with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people remains widespread.
Because of the conservative values of this country, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men marry women.
Many diseases are transmitted through the use of inappropriate sexual protection in relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has mandated universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied that her staff leaked data from GOP senators, and has upended what she calls "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Maxine Waters reported on Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information on three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
Democrats in Los Angeles say the allegations were pushed by "ultra-power wing" experts and websites.
"More lies, more lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included information from three U.S. senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
This information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing of allegations of sexual misconduct against Senate Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source was linked to Waters' office and released information from a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and completely untrue", continued Waters.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent false allegations - disclaim any responsibility whatsoever for the leak of this information.
"This unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and completely untrue".
Waters's statement was immediately met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This is a denial born of anger", Fleischer wrote.
"You're showing that you're not qualified to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't show anger.
He must not show a defiant attitude.
He must not question the motives of the accuser.
She must appear calm and unassuming".
It seemed Fleischer wanted to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by critics for his excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who is seeking Waters' removal in the midterm legislative elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"If relevant is true", he tweeted.
In her statements, Waters said her office had alerted "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities with respect to these fraudulent statements.
"We ensure that those who have broken the law are identified", she continued, "and held accountable to the law for any actions that are harmful or dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again film review - parody of the spy Rowan Atkinson
It has now become traditional to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film with a British twist, and that does not seem to be applicable in the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise that began in 2003 with Johnny English and returned again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
By satirizing ourselves with the fact that we are obviously garbage, will we create a new export opportunity for our nation?
Anyway, the big-eyed, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has renewed his license to fuck things up for the second time, his name just goes to show that above all else, he is nothing more than a broad comic creation designed for territories that watch non-English-language cinema.
Despite his peculiar desire to achieve flattering glamour, he's a silly secret agent who resembles Clouseau, of course, with a hint of Mr Bean and a little bit of the guy who supports Chariots of Fire with a single note at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
The mysterious international traveler played by Atkinson in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials is also based on the man himself, leaving chaos behind.
There's a cool moment or two in this last big trip of JE's.
I liked the way Johnny English approached the helicopter wearing a medieval armor and the rotor knobs were hitting his head.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is evident on screen, but his humor lacks depth and is too superfluous, especially when film-marks like 007 and Mission Impossible's "serious" films now include comedy among their ingredients.
Humor seems more geared to children than to adults, and to me the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as clever and clever as the jokes of Bean's character in Atkinson's silent films.
The constant, perennial premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network, exposing the identities of all British agents working on it, and the acting agent is in a state of despair, unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
That's a lot for a prime minister whose pompous, haunted character is already losing her political credibility completely: Emma Thompson is at her best with a character that's almost like Teresa May, but the script doesn't help much.
His intelligence advisors tell him that since all the assets of the spy network have been compromised, he must recover someone who is retired.
And that means that Johnny English is doing as well as he can, teaching at a fancy place, but teaching a confidential class on how to be an undercover operative, with some great jokes, because English is running a "School of Rock" type of spy academy.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he is reunited with his former partner, Bough, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, linked to a submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine is lost in that little rich-boy role.
So, in His Highness' Secret Service, making things miserable, we have Batman and Robin back in action, running into Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is fascinated by a tech billionaire who claims he can fix Britain's IT disaster in the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their farcical adventure by disguised as waiters setting fire to a French restaurant, creating chaos by sneaking into Volta's luxury yacht, and then causing total anarchy when English tries to use his virtual reality headsets to see what Volta's house looks like from the inside.
All the stops are geared towards that final sequence, but as enjoyable and noisy as it is, it's all very much like children's TV.
A little bit.
And I was thinking, as I had with many other Johnny English films, could we not give Rowan Atkinson a role that the British film industry would do with her talent?
The Labour Party denies that they are working on a plan to get the British to work four days a week, but they are working on a plan to get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working one day a week but getting paid for five days.
It seems that the bosses of the companies want to share the savings made by the AI revolution with the workers, by giving them an extra day off.
The workers would get three days off, but they would still get the same paycheck.
Sources say the idea 'fits well' with the party's economic agenda and that it wants to put the country on the side of the workers.
The move to a four-day work week has received the backing of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week "coincides with the party's vision of re-orientating the economy "to the workers, and the party's overall industrial strategy".
The Labour Party would not be a party that supports such an idea, as the Green Party had advocated a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the aspiration has not yet been supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party voter has stated that "the four-day work week is not part of the party's policy and the party does not recognise it as such".
The shadow minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's congress last week to shape his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said, without a shadow of a doubt, that the 'faceless directors' and 'speculators' had to be removed from power in the public service companies.
The shadow minister's plan also implies that the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their full share, because a Labour government could impose deductions if there was any evidence of wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to incorporate employees into company boards and to create Exclusive Property Funds to give employees 10% of the capital of private sector companies, which could cover annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the results of that investigation could lead a Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was anything the FBI could uncover that might change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I suppose it is", said Kennedy.
"I said, 'I went to the hearing, I said, 'I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, he made the allegation known, I said, "Did you do that?"
He responded with firmness, with clarity, without hesitation".
Graham's vote, however, seems to be etched in stone.
"I am determined that Brett Kavanaugh will be charged with a charge that would have caused a bomb explosion", he said.
"Mr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett adamantly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all the people she mentions have been unable to confirm it.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything that's changed".
What is the Global Citizen's Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen's Festival, an annual musical event that brings together some of the greatest artists and has the ultimate mission to end world poverty.
Now in its 17th year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring thousands of people to the Great Plains of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal, which is to eradicate extreme poverty before 2030.
The Global Citizen's Festival, founded in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), those who wish to attend the concert must perform a number of tasks or "actions", such as sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise engaging in a meaningful call to help raise awareness of the poverty eradication goal.
But what kind of success has Global Citizen achieved with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is this original idea of encouraging people to take action by doing a free concert, or is this just another case of what's called clicktivism, where people feel like they're making a real difference by signing a petition online or tweeting something?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" by its followers, pushing for various goals.
It says that world leaders have been encouraged to announce policies and commitments worth more than $37 billion, and these actions, these policies and commitments will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by the year 2030.
As of early 2018, the group had cited 390 commitments and announcements stemming from the deeds, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or received.
The group estimates that the funds guaranteed have had a direct impact on approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition, "a UK-based community of investors and implementers committed to helping children develop their full potential".[5][6] The group has pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country, after receiving over 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.[7]
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen like you, we will make social injustice of malnutrition history", said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, in front of an audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 events in the UK to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government announced it would fund the Power of Nutrition project, a project that will help more than 5 million women and children through nutrition-related interventions.
In response to this question from the FAQs on the website, what makes you think we can actually end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, and we will stumble and fail sometimes.
But like our great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be among the performers at this year's event in New York City, which will be hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Army to blockade Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
"If necessary, Washington could use the Navy to block access to Russian energy markets, including in the Middle East", US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has been quoted by the Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke has argued that Russia's ties to Syria -- where it is obviously operating at the request of the legitimate government -- are just an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to deal in energy, the way they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with this.
"The United States, with our military, has the ability to ensure that the sea lines are open and, if necessary, to block them, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to attendees at an event hosted by the Energy Alliance for Consumers, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of consumer energy" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, making it clear that they were ultimately identical.
"The economic choice we have with respect to Iran and Russia is, roughly, to exploit and replace fossil fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a "single-resource" economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The comments come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to promote the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to convince Germany to pull out of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which makes Moscow a "captive" to Berlin, according to Trump.
Moscow has insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing 110 billion cubic meters of gas, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's fierce opposition to the project is motivated purely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US attitude has been received negatively by the German side and it has reiterated its commitment to the project.
The leading industrial organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries, has urged the United States to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a serious problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
While in a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider running.
"It's time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, which requires a woman at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I would consider running for president".
Warren spoke at City Hall about Donald Trump, saying he was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted Friday, Warren said, "It's clear we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not think she should run for president in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said they thought Senator Thompson should not run for president, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Policy Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of the nomination.
The poll shows that support for former Governor Deval Patrick's chances of running is stronger, with 38 percent supporting a potential run and 48 percent opposed.
Other names mentioned in the news regarding a possible 2020 run include Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden said he would officially decide by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentioned the Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder during Donald Trump's campaign speech in the presidential election.
Track Palin, 26, spent more than a year in Iraq after it was invaded in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night in the home of the
"What my son is going through, what he is going through on his return, I feel identified with the complicated effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the vulnerabilities that our soldiers bring when they return", he told a crowd at a pro-Donald Trump campaign event in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "a remarkable thing", and said of her son and other war veterans "that they come back a little bit changed, they come back tough, they come back wondering if there's that respect for the other soldiers and the airmen and all the other army men who have given their country".
She was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assaulting a woman with domestic violence, domestic violence and a statement that she was intoxicated with a weapon, according to police spokesman Dan Bennett of Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support impeachment of the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a declaration of friendship Friday to offer protection to an asylum seeker in Washington, defying police, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the lawsuit Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not being disclosed.
She said she was sexually abused by her partner "and his violent gang members", but US officials denied her asylum application filed on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas, man.
The state attorneys who are defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence problems, as they are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the US.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine of the District of Columbia said in a statement Friday that "the new police system ignores years of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications must be assigned based on the facts and particular circumstances of the application, and such a bar violates that principle", the amicus curiae statement noted.
Additionally, the lawyers argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy, because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the "necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered an immigration judge in June to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear of persecution because of race, religion, nationality or fear of belonging to a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said when unveiling the policy on June 11.
The shelter itself has never been a solution to the complex problems that people all over the world face every day, however serious those problems are.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles, the race to find survivors continues.
For the survivors, the situation was worsening.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, the mother, who was feverish while calming her son down in the devastated city of Palu.
Ambulances are bringing in the corpses every minute.
We don't have clean water".
People were seen running back to their destroyed homes, taking their flooded belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people are injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, are overwhelmed.
Some of the wounded, such as Dwi Haris, with a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated in the periphery due to constant aftershocks.
Tears flowed from his eyes as he told how he felt the violent shaking of the earthquake when he was in a hotel room with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I think I was crushed against the debris of the wall", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or her daughter.
I hope they're safe".
The US ambassador has accused China of "propaganda-based" attacks on the US.
After a Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad promoting the mutual benefits of trade with China in an EEC newspaper, the US ambassador accused Beijing of using the US press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to the surcharge he paid for the Des Moines Register, the second-largest selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, last Wednesday, after accusing China of trying to interfere with the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation China denies.
Trump's alleged attempt by Beijing to interfere in the US election marked what US officials told Reuters was a new campaign in Washington to pressure China.
While it's not unusual for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a festering trade war in which each country is placing barriers on the other's imports.
China's retaliatory spikes that gave Trump's Republican Party cover early in the trade war were intended to target exports in states like Iowa, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and long-time governor of Iowa, one of the states that exports the most agricultural products to China, said that Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad stated in an article in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "China is now intensifying its attack by placing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading propaganda, he is capitalizing on America's strong tradition of free press and freedom of the press by placing paid advertisements by the Chinese government in the Des Moines Register newspaper", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, here at the newsstand right on the streets of Beijing, there are few dissenting voices and no true reflection of the differing opinions that Chinese people may have regarding China's turbulent economic trajectory, as the media is subject to the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers has declined an offer to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans are discouraging female voters ahead of the midterm elections. With Kavanaugh's defeat, analysts warn,
With many high-profile Republicans expected to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a drop in support, especially among women, in the next legislative midterm elections.
Emotions around this issue have been overwhelming, and a majority of Republicans are registered to vote to go ahead with the vote.
There is no going back on those issues", said Grant Reeher, professor at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubts that the pressure that Senator Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, would exert to support an FBI investigation would be enough to calm an angry electorate.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, and not in November either", said senior advisor Karine Jean-Pierre and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, with protesters shouting "November is coming!" protesting outside the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who was present, stated on Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be out of place", independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news website.
"People say it's already had a big impact; that's true.
But it could have an even greater impact, especially among suburban women who don't have a fixed vote and younger people between the ages of 18 and 29, considering that often they don't like the president, but they don't vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony against the Supreme Court nominee detailing the sexual assault, analysts suggested a possible downturn if the Republicans decided to proceed with the resignation.
"It's become a major upheaval for the Republican Party", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the board vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh should sit in the accused's chair, it's about how the Republicans handled this issue and how they treated the woman", Guy Cecil, the director of the group that helps Democrats elect "Priorities USA", told the news channel.
However, it seems that the American people are fairly divided between the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies when it comes to deciding which one to believe, but it seems that a little more people are in favor of the latter.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41% of respondents said they definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, and 35% said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh's testimony.
Also, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or probably lied in his testimony, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and at least those made by another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted him when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party when they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to rival Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, wants to start a startup that is going to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source software platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who will have access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the purpose behind Inrupt was to "take over the world".
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal data warehouse" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify: all working together in one browser, all working together.
The distinctive feature of Linea personal data warehouses is that it is entirely up to the user who can access a particular type of information.
"Data-driven empowerment of people", they call it.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to put the right resources, processes and skills in place to help make Solid available to all.
At this point, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not "talking to Facebook and Google about the need to make a radical change when they completely change their business models overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to establish an ecosystem and commercial energy that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very, very optimistic about this next era of the Internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: The cleric was awarded the Victoria Cross of the First World War
The only Church of England cleric to receive the Victoria Cross for his service in the First World War has been honoured, 100 years after his hometown.
The honourable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never knew that he had received the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "very symbolic" to have the stone displayed 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Channel at Saint-Quentin "in a very tight cloud and under the constant fire of cannons and machine guns".
Then he rushed to the first line of fire, and with all the courage he guided the line forward until he encountered a cannon and he single-handedly brought down three destakamendados.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said he knew his grandfather's actions "would never have been able to do himself, but it is a great humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Imperial Brentwood Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "it proves the courage of a true hero by the support that many people will give him".
Millions of MMA fans waited all night to see Bellator 206, but they got Peppa Pig instead.
Let's say you've been up all night watching the Bellator 206, and then you're not allowed to watch the main show.
The San Jose event featured 13 matches, six of which were scheduled on the main calendar, and was broadcast live in the evening on UK Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, and the UK audience was shocked when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some of them were not surprised to find themselves up until the wee hours of the morning to fight again.
One follower described the change to children's cartoons as a "bad joke" on Twitter.
"A government law said that this content was not suitable for 6:00 in the morning, and they had to switch to children's programming", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the show.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they will be looking at programming to cater for UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we can probably fix it", Coker said.
"But it's 6:00 a.m. there on a Sunday, and we can't fix that until it's our Sunday, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the move was made, there was a lot of messages going back and forth, and not all of them were very nice.
So we tried to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't. It was a government thing.
I promise you, next time, it won't happen again.
What if we had five fights instead of the six fights we usually have, and we tried to give people more, and we fucked up.
This is an unfortunate situation that's going to happen".
Tom Daley 'underestimated' in terms of sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling underestimated by others for sex, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said it wasn't until he went to high school that he realized "not everyone is like him".
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Radio 4's Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke to give others "hope" about gay rights.
He also said that having a child made winning the Olympic Games less important.
Our longtime regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken several months of sick leave.
After appearing to be completely lost in Laverne's first program, Daley said that she felt "underrated" compared to everyone else because society did not accept her as "like boys and girls".
And he said, "Until today, the very same feelings that make you feel inferior and different from others are the real motivators that have empowered and given me the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", as she called it, because she didn't want to disappoint people when they found out about her sexuality.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT advocate, and used her participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said she gave her opinion because she felt lucky to have the freedom to live freely without the consequences and because she wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "surprised her".
Daley married an Oscar-winning actress who is 20 years older than he is last year, but he said the age difference between them was not an issue.
She said, "When you're so young and you have to go through so many things" - she went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to find someone her age who's gone through similar experiences.
The couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley has said that it has changed his "entire outlook".
"If you'd asked me last year, the only thing I would have been thinking was, 'I want to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"And, you know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley told his father that he couldn't accept that he was going to be killed, and one of the last things he asked for was to get tickets for the London 2012 Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be able to be in the front line, Dad".
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing, and I didn't accept until he stopped breathing and died that he wasn't invincible", she said.
The next day Daley participated in the 2012 Olympic Games, where she won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I'd dreamed of all my life, to be in front of a local audience at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired her first song selection -Proud, by Heather Small-, which made her feel identified throughout the process of preparing for the Olympic Games and still gives her the goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, was forced to sit on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
Phil Mickelson is set to break the record in the 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to work on his form to make a good impression.
Mickelson was breaking the record for two years in a row by playing in the event for the 12th time; however, he was sent to the bench by captain Jim Fury in Saturday's fourball and foursome events.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has been so many times for the United States, the five-time major champion divided his day between cheering and working the game on the field, hoping to fix what was hurting him.
He was never the most straightforward of drivers, not even in the prime of his career, and the 48-year-old is not the best choice for the competitive dynamic of Le Golf National, where the strongest players dominate the underdogs.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will have to face, in game nine, on Sunday, Francesco Molina, the reigning British Open champion, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of this week's games.
The Americans, four points down after 12 games, if they start well, Mickelson's play could be decisive.
Fury showed his confidence in his man, who could not say much more.
"He understood his role for today so well, "that he patted me on the back and said he'd be ready for tomorrow", said Fury.
"He is very self-confident.
He's a top-notch athlete and he's been a tremendous asset to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't even see him play twice.
I expected more, but that's what happened, and we felt like that's how we had to do it.
She wants to be there like the rest of them".
Mickelson is going to break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could be the end of his Ryder Cup career, never reaching the single-game mark again.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 18, and been shut out seven times, but according to Furyk, he's brought something intangible to the team.
"He's funny and sarcastic and smart and he likes to joke with people and it's great to have him", she said.
"The young players have enjoyed playing against him this week, and it's been fun to watch.
He does more than just play".
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, is aware that their massive advantage could be wiped out in a moment.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from personal experience that despite the strong lead in the final round of singles, the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable situation.
The Danish debuted in Valderrama in 1997, where his team under Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but narrowly won the championship with a score of 141⁄2 to 131⁄2.
"I keep reminding myself that we had a big lead at Valderrama and we barely won, and we lost at Brooklyn even though we had a big lead", said Bjorn (pictured), who won the 2018 class 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
So the story is telling me and the rest of the team that this is not over yet.
We'll be in full Kema tomorrow.
We're going to go out on the field and try to do everything right.
Nothing is decided until we have the points on the board.
We're focused on winning the trophy, and that's what we're going to focus on.
As I've always said, I'm focusing on the 12 players in our side, but we know what's on the other side, some of the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who is delighted with the achievements of his players on a difficult golf course, has also said: "I never want to improve anything.
It's about tomorrow.
You're going solo tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's great to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on your own, every golfer has to prove what they're really made of.
That's the message I want to give to the players: "Give it your best tomorrow".
Now forget about your colleagues, they need to be able to do their best too".
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Fury of the other team feels that his players will perform better than individually as a team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who both have three out of four points.
Fury himself was on both sides of the last day's turnaround as part of the winning team in Brooklyn and later losing to the European team, when the Europeans created what they called a "media miracle".
"I remember all the words I said", he said, when we asked Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, how he had cheered the players on the last day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, "but we want to keep the lead from the very start, "just like in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the other side has the advantage, there's a lot of pressure on those middle-of-the-way games.
We decided based on that shortlist, and I'm confident we'll do a great job tomorrow".
Thomas is in charge of the counter-attack, and his opponents in the final match are Rory McIlroy, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, all of whom are the top-ranked European players.
"I chose this team in the order they were selected because they were likely to make the entire journey", Bjørn said of the selected individuals.
The construction of the new German battleship has been postponed again.
The new German navy frigate was to be ordered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be built until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media say.
The order for the warship "Rheinland-Pfalz" (the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates) has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit.
The vessel was to be commissioned in 2014, but a series of problems since its delivery have prevented the completion of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is reported to have a powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missile characteristics and stealth-action technology (e.g., reduced radar, and infrared and acoustic signatures).
It will also have longer maintenance capacities: the newest frigates can stay up to two years out of the home ports.
However, due to the constant delays, the warships with the latest technology (which Germany aims to project its power) will be outdated by the time they enter service, reports Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate caused a lot of media buzz last year when the German Navy officially rejected its request for the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after it had been delivered.
The reasons for the translation are not known, but the German media mentioned "serious software and hardware flaws, which would have rendered the warship unusable in combat missions.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships will be operated by 120 sailors, which is half of those on the Bremen class frigates.
In addition, the ship is overweighted and consequently its performance is greatly reduced, making it more difficult for the Navy to add innovations in the future.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs twice as much as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the cost of the entire project (including the training of the crew) is also a problem.
It's reportedly reached €3.1 billion from the €2.2 billion it was originally supposed to cost.
The problems of these new frigates are all the more significant in the face of warnings that the German Navy is losing its ability to operate.
A few months ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy is running out of boats.
The representative said that the problem has become more and more serious as no replacement vessels have been provided since the old vessels were retired.
He regretted that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate had entered the navy.
The secret life of the bat has been revealed by the National Trust.
A new study has been conducted on a plot in the Highlands of Scotland to investigate how bats use the landscape to forage for food.
They hope that more information will be gained about the behavior of these special flying mammals, so that they can better define activities to protect them in the future.
The research being conducted by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland (NTS) will follow the common and soprano dwarf bat, as well as the big-eared and Daubenton bat, in Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be installed in key locations and the bat's activities will be monitored throughout the season.
UK National Health Service (NHS) personnel will also conduct mobile drilling with hand-held detectors.
When the experts analyze the sound of all the recorders we can now know the frequency of the calls made by the bats and what each species is doing.
The habitat is mapped and logged to provide a detailed landscape-scale picture of bat behavior.
According to Rob Dewarer, a conservation consultant at the NTS, the study will determine the most important areas of bat habitat, as well as how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the advantages of habitat treatment work, such as the creation of grasslands, and how best to maintain forests for bats and related species.
The bat population in Scotland and indeed the whole of the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development which affects the nesting and habitat loss of the birds.
Also a danger comes from wind turbines and lightning, as well as fly-catching paper, chemical treatments on building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not really blind.
The animal is not a living creature, but a living creature.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to detect bugs or obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS is responsible for 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 acres in Scotland, and takes bats very seriously.
The zoo has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct observations, nest inspections and occasional rescues.
In fact, the institution has created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Dumfries and Galloway Threave estate; it is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
According to David Thompson, the land manager, the land is perfect for them.
"We have a perfect area for the Threaven bat", he said.
"We have old buildings and old trees, so it's a perfect habitat.
However, there is still a lot we don't know about bats, and that means that through the work we do here and on other plots, we will understand what they need to stay healthy".
Thompson has noted the importance of checking for bats on the property before any maintenance work is done; in fact, the accidental destruction of a single maternal nest could result in the death of 400 female and young bats, and possibly the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or harm them or to destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative of the Bat Conservation Association, is appealing for help from the general population.
He said, "There is still so much we have to learn about bats, and we don't know how many of the species that live with us work".
Ronaldo has dropped all rape charges, while his lawyers rush to file a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has said that the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and that those who made it only want to "get publicity" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the story.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman Kathryn Mayorga in Las Vegas in 2009.
After that, he allegedly paid her $375,000 in exchange for keeping the incident quiet, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Hours after the allegation was released, the 33-year-old Ronaldo made a live Instagram video for his 142 million followers on the platform, in which he called the allegations "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, and no.
"All of this is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner on camera.
They want to use my name for publicity.
It's only natural.
They want to make a name for themselves by saying my name, but that's what happens in my line of work.
"I'm a happy man, and everything is fine", said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sell Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they say are unacceptable publications about suspicious invasion of privacy.
"The player's lawyer, Christian Schertz, has said that he will seek compensation "in view of the gravity of the incident, "which is one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting him at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's bedroom where he allegedly raped her from behind, according to documents from the District Court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorca has stated that Ronaldo went down on his knees after the alleged incident, and in '99 he was a good man, but in '100 he was wrong.'
According to the documents, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had sex, but that the relationship was consensual.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in hospital, but later reached an out-of-court settlement because she was terrified of reprisals and was worried about being publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old woman said she wants to call off the deal because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on his way to a transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and last summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will forever regret the loss of its car manufacturers
The UK will forever regret its decision to step down as the leader of the car manufacturing industry after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He also said it was "concerned" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if the UK left the EU without a deal.
"Let's make a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese automaker has said that delays in customs due to a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory (which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles) produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"We believe that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal by the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cook, Managing Director of Toyota of Burnsdon.
Other UK car manufacturers (including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover) have also expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if the UK leaves the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, has said that it will close its Mini factory for a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is "on demand", with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for all on-demand cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border outages and consequently delays and missing parts.
It would not be possible for Toyota to store more than a day's worth of inventory at the factory in Derbyshire; as a result, production would have to be halted.
Clark said that Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for the future of our relationship in the EU is "specifically designed to avoid these sort of customs checks".
"We need to have an agreement, we want the best deal, not just to ensure success now, but to take advantage of this opportunity in the future", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"Toyota is not the only manufacturer to have proven the importance of continuing to have highly successful supply chains".
Toyota has not been able to say how long the shutdown will last, but warns that in the long run, the additional costs will reduce the factory's competitiveness and, consequently, the loss of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the factory coordinator for the Unite union, said that the members are increasingly worried: "I know from experience that if we lose these jobs we will not be able to get them back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a concrete and credible plan for future relations with the European Union".
The Trump-Rosenstein summit may be postponed again, at the behest of the White House.
The important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose office is investigating Russian influence in the U.S. election, the links between Trump associates and Russia, and the president's alleged obstruction of justice.
There has been a heated discussion in Washington over the past few months whether Trump's dismissal of the deputy attorney general could jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein considered carrying a hidden microphone to record his conversations with Trump, as well as removing the president from office under Article 25 of the US Constitution.
Rosenstein has denied the information.
And yet, he went to the White House last Monday as rumors circulated that he was going to resign.
Instead, the man who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time indicated that he had a meeting with Trump on Thursday.
Trump has said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then postponed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked for a week-long investigation by the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which has delayed the Senate vote even further.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "We don't have a date set yet, it could be this week, but I would understand a delay of another week given everything that's going on in the Supreme Court.
However, we'll see; I always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters will disagree with that statement because Sanders hasn't held a White House press conference since September 10.
Our host Chris Wallace asked him why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not because the TV reporters were "over-the-top", but he said, "I agree they are over-the-top".
After that, he suggested that there would be an increase in direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president has spent far more time in question and answer than his predecessors", he said, adding without citing evidence, "We have verified these statistics".
Sanders said they'll continue to hold press conferences, but if a press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, that's much better than asking me.
We've tried to do that a lot, and you've seen that we've done it a lot in the last few weeks, and this will replace the press conference, where we're giving you a chance to talk to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House, attends open sessions, or during press conferences that are held when visiting dignitaries.
It's not his practice to hold press conferences.
The possible reason for this has been revealed by the President of the United States, as he made a spontaneous and sometimes bizarre appearance to a gathering of reporters in New York this week.
The Secretary of Health for the United Kingdom has written a letter to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS system, in light of concerns about Brexit.
The health secretary has written to all EU staff working for Scotland's NHS to thank them on behalf of the whole country and urge them to stay after Brexit.
With less than six months remaining before the UK leaves the EU, a letter has been written by Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to pay the costs of applying for settled status for EU citizens working in the public sector.
Freeman said in his letter: "Over the summer, Brexit negotiations have progressed between the UK and the EU, and a decision is expected by the autumn.
However, the UK government has stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this is a very anxious time for all of you.
And so I can confirm that I deeply appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues in the European Union and beyond bring valuable expertise and experience to enhance the work of health services for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home, and we expect you to stay with us for a lifetime".
Christie Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers running back Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury after Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
According to Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed, the player suffered a head injury just before the halftime break.
"He sank his left arm and lost consciousness", said Reed.
The coaches and medical staff on the band gave Abercrombie oxygen and took him to a stretcher for further medical examination.
A spokesman for Tennessee State has told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that he is recovering from surgery and is currently being treated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said they have not yet provided any details regarding the type of injury or its severity, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
He is in his second year with the red Abercrombie jerseys, and is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles before he missed the game on Saturday, for a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher toll tax when they buy properties in the UK.
Foreign buyers will be required to pay a higher toll tax when they buy properties in the UK, and the extra amount will be used to help those left homeless, according to the Conservative Party's plans.
This strategy is designed to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The toll on the bell will be increased for those who do not pay their tax in the UK.
The Treasury estimates that they will raise an additional 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher bell tax when they buy property in the UK, and the surcharge will be used to help those who have become homeless, Theresa May said today.
This strategy is intended to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters by providing affordable housing and promising higher taxes for those with the highest incomes.
The increase in bell tax will be used for individuals and businesses that do not pay their UK property tax, and the surplus collected will be used for the government's efforts to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is an additional tax on the current bell (including the top-tier taxes for second homes introduced two years ago and for properties purchased for rent), can reach up to three percent.
The Treasury estimates that this will raise an additional £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of all properties built in London are bought by non-UK residents, resulting in higher prices and making it more difficult for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
The country's affluent areas, especially in the capital, have become "mother towns" as foreign buyers tend to spend most of their time outside the city.
This new policy comes after Boris Johnson's call for a tax cut on the bell to help young people buy their first homes.
He blames the big builders for keeping property prices high by buying and unusing land and urges May to set aside the quota of affordable housing to solve Britain's housing crisis.
Corbyn, for his part, has introduced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent control and unjustified evictions.
It also wants to empower the councils to build more housing.
May said, "I said last year that I would dedicate my presidency to restoring the British dream, to improving the lives of every generation.
That means we're gonna fix the problems in the housing market.
Britain's doors will always be open to those who want to live, work and shape their lives here.
However, for people who do not live in the UK and for British residents who work hard for companies abroad to be as easy as buying homes is not fair.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too far away, and the dreariness of those who have to sleep on the streets is still here".
Jack Ross: "My greatest wish is to be Scotland's national team coach"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his greatest ambition is to one day coach the Scotland team.
The 42-year-old Scot is relishing the challenge of reviving the North East club, who are third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mir's team returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"I just wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a League B trophy, and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"But I watched the Scotland games in Hampden with my father when I was a boy, and I always wanted to go back.
However, I would have a chance only if I had the ability to manage the club".
Those who have coached Sunderland before Ross include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former boss of Alloa Athletic has said he did not feel nervous about coming after such big names; in fact, he had turned down offers to coach Barnsley and Ipswich Town before.
"To measure success, I have to ask myself, 'Can I get the club back into the Premier League?
Given the structure of the club and the facilities, it should be in the Premier League, without a doubt".
"It's not going to be easy to get there, but I don't see myself as successful if I can't do that".
It has only been three years since Ross took over as coach, having served as assistant to Dumbarton's head for a period and as one of Hearts' coaching staff after 15 months.
He then helped Allo recover after being relegated to the third division, and also thanks to him, St Mir went from being on the verge of relegation to championship status the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he was at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a real crossroads for me, maybe", he said about taking charge of Allo.
"I really felt that being a coach was the right role for me to take rather than being a player.
It's funny that I said that because, in fact, I was a good player, I was making a good living, and I had some really big moments.
But playing can be rough.
You have to put up with a lot every week.
I still have to deal with the stress and the pressure of the job, but I'm happy with it as a coach.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now that I'm doing it, I feel more comfortable in my own skin than ever before".
The full interview will be broadcast on Sunday 30th September on Radio Scotland's Sportsound from 12:00 to 13:00 (BST)
5:30 on a Saturday is the best time to have a drink, according to a poll.
The summer heat wave has dramatically increased the revenues of pubs in Britain, but it has also put further pressure on the restaurant chains.
Sales of pubs and bars rose 2.7 percent while restaurant sales fell 4.8 percent, according to the data.
Peter Martin, who works at CGA, the business consultancy that has collected the data, says: "As the sun has been shining continuously and England's team has lasted longer than expected at the Football World Cup, the July data is similar to that of June, where the pubs' revenues have risen by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants' have fallen even more.
And while restaurant sales were down 1.8 percent in June, they were even worse in July.
Pubs and bars specializing in drinks have had much better performance, and their increase has been greater than the decline in restaurant sales.
Food-specialized pubs have also suffered under the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems like people are just interested in a drink.
"Drinks sales in pubs and bars have risen 6.6% in the last month, "while food sales have fallen 3%".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the influence of social and sporting events are the most important factors when it comes to out-of-home retail sales.
It is not surprising that the restaurant industry is experiencing financial difficulties, and a 4.8% drop in sales from one year to the next will cause significant damage, in addition to continued cost pressures.
The long, hot summer comes at a bad time for establishments specializing in food, and it remains to be seen whether the moderate temperatures in August will provide them with some relief".
Sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, rose 2.7% in July, as the expansion of the chains slowed down.
The Coffer Peach Tracker index tracks sales in the sector for UK pubs, bars and restaurants by collecting and analysing performance data from 47 operator groups, which together have revenues of over £9 billion, and is considered the benchmark for the sector.
One in five kids has social media accounts they've hidden from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) have accounts on social media that they've been hiding from parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that fake Instagram accounts have increased
This news has increased the fear that he is publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a senior account that their parents can see.
But one in five of those kids (some as young as 11) have accounts on social media that they've been hiding from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found that fake Instagram accounts have increased significantly.
This news has increased the fear that sexual content may be being published.
Twenty percent of students say they have a "clean" main account that their parents can see, but they also have private accounts.
A mother accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret website where a teenager was telling others to "rape me".
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) in the UK found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, and half of them admit to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan says, "It is worrying that teenagers are tempted to create secret online spaces that parents and teachers cannot find".
Eilidh Doyle to be the "athletes' spokesperson" for the Scottish athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed as the new Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Board at this year's General Meeting of the Board of Trustees.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete, and sports director Ian Beattie said this turnaround is a great opportunity for those who guide the sport to capitalize on the vast experience he has gained over the past decade internationally.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we know that her presence in the board will be a huge asset to Scottish athletics", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I'm looking forward to being the spokesman for the athletes, and I hope I can make a real contribution to bringing the sport to Scotland".
The American won the 200 and 400 metres races at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, and has four gold medals in total.
He tweeted this: "A month ago, I had a heart attack.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said he was going to see if I would recover, or to what extent.
It was really hard, but I'm totally back on track, so I had to learn to walk again, and I was doing some stunts today!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages you sent me!"
A commercial for a dairy farm that compares a mother to cows has generated mixed reactions on the Internet.
A company that produces milk has generated some negative reviews on the Internet, compared to the milk cows that are breast-fed.
To promote what is claimed to be the world's first silent milk-making laptop, consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous advertisement inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom the new device gives to mothers who are milking.
Four women who are actually mothers, dancing in a barn full of straw, to a song with words like these: "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't stick, and, 'You may not have noticed, but these are not beads, these are my tits.'"
It's like, "Sweep, sweep, sweep, I'm milking my girls".
However, this ad posted on the company's Facebook page has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated a variety of reactions from viewers, many of whom said that the dairy industry's mischief is not taken seriously.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
"Their lives are in danger because they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed, and they are not able to breed".
Elvie can be discreetly inserted into one of the breasts to milk (Elvie/Mother)
Another person said, "Well, of course, it's very traumatic for the mother and the child.
But, hey, why not use it to advertise a milk cart for mothers who don't get their babies taken away from them?"
Another added, "This ad has no manners at all".
Others, however, have defended the ad, with one woman confessing that she "found it funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I'd buy one.
I was a milkmaid and felt like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but that's the point of it.
It's a great product", one user wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny commercial, aimed at mothers who are getting their milk (often in the workplace or in the bathroom) because they feel like 'cows'".
It is not intended to praise or judge the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show that they have been dancing with the milk-pulling device in their bra.
The campaign acknowledges that many women who are milked feel like cows.
The Elvie milk pump is completely silent, and has no cables or wires. It can be discreetly carried on one of the breast-sets, moving the women as desired, so that the babies can be on the arms or out on the street.
Ana Balarin, Mother's partner and executive creative director, commented: "Elvie's milkshake is a very revolutionary product, and therefore required a bold and provocative introduction.
With this analogy of women drawing milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenges of drawing milk and at the same time express the freedom that drawing milk brings in an entertaining and intimate way.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk-pulling has attracted a lot of attention.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother with two children appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into a tent camp on the border of Texas.
The number of migrant children being detected has increased dramatically in recent years, despite the border surveillance being more or less the same, in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and guidelines have made it harder to get children into shelters.
Until now, undocumented immigrants have been the most supportive, but now they're afraid if they sign up to protect their children, they may lose their ability to stay in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities said that prospective sponsors and other adults living in their homes would have to submit fingerprints, which would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified before Congress that dozens of people who had sought protection for unaccompanied minors had been arrested.
The NSA later confirmed that 70 percent of those who were arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who sponsor or live with them are in our country illegally, and many of them are criminal aliens.
So we are still tracking them", Albence said.
In order to process the situation more quickly, the officers have recently created new rules according to which children must appear in court within one month of their capture, instead of 60 days as before, at the request of the shelter staff.
Many of them will be appearing in a video conference call to an immigration judge to ask for legal status.
If they are deemed unfit to receive any help, they will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in day care centers, the more likely they are to develop anxiety and depression, which may result in violent outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, according to shelter staff and reports made to the system in recent months.
Child advocates say that these concerns are exacerbated in large facilities like Tornillo, because it is so large, there is a greater likelihood of ignoring children's problems.
They also said that if they send kids to camp without the emotional preparation or time to say goodbye to their friends, it may just aggravate the trauma they've already experienced.
Syria has called on the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war being in its eighth year.
The Deputy Prime Minister, Moualem, has said that foreign forces are illegally present in Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and will be treated as "dagokyon".
"They must be removed from the territory immediately and unconditionally", he said.
Moualem says the war against terrorism in Syria is almost over, a war that has killed 360,000 people since 2011 and forced millions to flee their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight in the holy battle until all of Syria's territory is cleared of terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising the Kurdish forces that are fighting President Bashar al-Assad and the Syrian Arabs.
France has 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that conditions are right for their return and blamed some Western countries for spreading "irrational fear" that keeps refugees out.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow these returns", he said.
"they are politicizing purely humanitarian matters".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any assistance to rebuild Syria until Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement to end the war.
Russia and Turkey recently reached an agreement to create a safe haven in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib, which U.N. diplomats say could lead to a political dialogue.
This Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia in the province of three million people.
However, Moualem said the agreement has "clear limits", and has stated that the military action will target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, who will be eliminated.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN envoy, hopes that the first meetings of the new assembly will soon be held between members of the government and the opposition, to begin the drafting of a post-war constitution, as well as to pave the way for elections.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the meeting, saying the meeting's work should be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution, and cautioning that no one else should intervene.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if (as many Democratic Party viewers probably expect) an impeachment trial or scandal does not end his presidency prematurely.
It would be the most dramatic end to a presidency!"
So far, the audience doesn't look tired.
Since 2014, the audience for CNN's prime-time network has nearly doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC's has tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News, for its part, has 2.4 million viewers in that time slot, up 1.7 million from four years ago, according to Nielsen data. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has the largest audience in cable television, reaching 3.5 million viewers on nights when major news events are taking place.
"It's like a fire that attracts people because we want to understand what's going on", says Neal Baer, host of ABC's Designated Survivor, a show about a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.

Scovel asked him why.
"Because it made her laugh", said Scovell.
Even in chaos there is time for entertainment.
Of course, like nothing else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington are about the fate of abortion laws, how immigrant families are reunited, and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged viewers can actually log off.
However, it goes beyond being informed if you spend six hours watching an expert debate on a wide range of topics: how Bob Woodward used "deep snow" to write "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (which The Washington Post calls "a suit of horns"), and Stormy Daniels's hilarious way of describing "Trump's anatomy".
I, for one, will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars says of Trump's character and shifting arguments on the show (discussing the NFL, praising Kim Jong-un): "It feels like a reality show, because it gives you something to consume every day.
You can't lose a piece of the game, you'll be left behind.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees and it was sunny in her house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He couldn't let it slip off the TV, especially now that Brett Kavanaugh has to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
"When I was doing these funny TV shows, people said it was the end of Western civilization", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Foreign money is pouring in on the deadly midterm elections to the U.S. Congress.
It's not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is seeing a flurry of money as congressional districts have been reorganized, resulting in two incumbent candidates vying for the same seat.
This district near Pittsburgh, which has recently been redistricted, is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election in another district.
Another challenger is Republican Keith Rothfus of the Lambs, who represents Pennsylvania's 12th District, which is split with the 17th District.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the county boundaries had been manipulated in favor of the Republicans in violation of the Constitution, resulting in the boundaries of the maps being properly delineated.
This competition for campaign financing in the new 17th district has resulted in tight competition for the parties' main sources of funding: the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning narrowly in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
It had been held by a Republican for the last decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points, too.
According to some political commentators, the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for its pro-China relationship, but then reversed the decision.
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized in Beijing that Washington barely asks them to back down.
Trump had a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and owned a hotel in Panama until his partners decided to fire the Trump organization's management team.
State Department officials voted to withdraw U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in the wake of the newly announced decision to discontinue recognition of "Taiwan", spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were considered to be solely against El Salvador, which received $140 million from the United States in aid in 2017 to, among other things, control narcotics trafficking, promote development, and support the economy.
Among the proposed penalties are a reduction in economic aid and a curtailment of visa issuance, which would be highly damaging to the Central American country given its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings proceeded, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was intended to be a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, and was considered a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from flowing into the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to hold the conference, and thus, the consideration of sanctions against El Salvador had been suspended.
Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend the conference, which has been moved to mid-October, according to diplomats at the White House, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting.
Three American diplomatic envoys have secretly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any notice or severe punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for the Bolton White House declined to comment on the details of the discussions reported by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to cover the internal discussions in exchange for anonymity.
The report was corroborated by an analyst with close ties to the administration who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn your history
Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report is about to be released, which will reveal whether Trump obstructed justice, for which there is ample evidence in the public view.
Mueller is also investigating whether Russia helped Trump's campaign during the recent U.S. election.
If the majority in Congress changes sides, Trump will have to brief him as he prepares to appear before voters again (and perhaps someday before a jury of his peers).
There are many conditions for that, however, and I don't mean Trump's inevitable collapse, nor Trump's European equivalents.
We have had to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and the choices will determine how long this conflict will last.

Our history is full of turning points like this that have either accelerated or retarded the inevitable progress of democracy.
Americans are facing several of these turning points right now.
What if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein? Roseenstein is the very person who controls what happens to Mueller's investigation.
Rosenstein's job has been on the line since this newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly filming the president and that the president was deemed unfit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times story is inaccurate.
"How do we respond if the investigation that the FBI has just commissioned into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is reassigned to the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury against him?
And most importantly, will we vote in this midterm so that we have a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, it will be a dark winter for democracy.
But I really think we'll get through it, based on the lessons I had in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the place where my embassy is now located.

Rangers' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the next game against Rapid Vienna.
Rapid Vienna will host Rangers on Thursday, knowing that if they beat the Austrians, after their thrilling draw with Spain's Villarreal a few weeks ago, they will be in the best position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans was unable to make his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, but feels the Rangers could use that as a springboard to better things.
"It was a good match, a good rival for Villarreal", said the 31-year-old.
"We played as if we were going to get something, and we ended up getting a point.
We might have had a chance to win the game at the end, but it's probably a fair draw.
They dominated the first half, but we dominated the second half.
Thursday night is a big night for the European Championships.
We hope to get the three points, but it's going to be difficult because they did a good job in the last game, but the crowd is supporting us, and I'm sure we'll move forward and make a positive outcome.
Last year was a difficult one, I had some injuries and there were some changes in the club itself, but right now it's a positive atmosphere.
It's a good team, the guys are having fun, the training is good.
I feel like we can move on, put the past behind us and make this a success".
Women are very worried about the problem of their retirement savings.
Most of the survey participants knew what kind of care they wanted to receive, but very few shared their concerns with family members.
Over half of the respondents in our Nationwide survey said they had talked to their partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have talked about it with their children.
"We want a family member to wait for us, but we don't dare ask for one", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Insurance.
Here are the first steps.
Talk to your spouse and your children, they're not going to be willing to take care of you unless you ask first.
Work with a counselor and the family to agree on where and how you would like to receive care, as the cost of care will depend on these choices.
You should get help from a consultant, a consultant can help you find ways to pay for those expenses.
You have more than one option to finance long-term care, including traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid insurance that allows you to pay for the costs of care in cash, and immediate insurance that allows you to pay for it with your own money, provided you have that money.
Clean up the legal paperwork, forget the legal disputes.
The choice of a trusted person to take care of your health, as well as ensuring that you are treated as you would like by a professional if you are unable to ask for it.
You're also more likely to have a lawyer take care of your finances.
You want to find someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and then, when you're unable to do so, make sure you pay your bills.
And don't forget to do a little bit of detail: let's say there are two elderly parents and one of them has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.

Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
The rescue team was unable to obtain information from the Donggala government, which is the area closest to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, north of Palu.
Please, over 16,000 people have been evacuated since the disaster.
Here are some important facts about the city of Palu and the Donggala government on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island; in 2017, it had a population of about 379,800.
The earthquake and tsunami occurred when the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala, on the other hand, is a government that covers an area of over 300 km (180 mi) forming the northwestern coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is the administrative county under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province is based on fishing and agriculture, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
The mining of nickel is also important in the province, but is concentrated mostly in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, Paluk and Donggala have experienced numerous tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of homes destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami occurred west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismic zone called the Pacific Ring of Fire, and is therefore subject to frequent earthquakes.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On 26 December, a large earthquake occurred off the western coast of Aceh province, north of Sumatra, Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that shook 14 countries, and killed 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Between late March and early April, a series of strong earthquakes occurred off the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most populated island, and caused a tsunami that rocked the southern coast, causing nearly 700 deaths.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of South Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a maximum 10-meter tsunami, destroyed dozens of villages, and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake in the Pidie Jaya Governorate of Aceh, bringing devastation and fear, as people remember the destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami occurred at that time, but over 100 people died crushed by the buildings.
2018: A series of large earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok, popular with tourists, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and many tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's oldest son has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence complaint, and resisting authority, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers division on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance started calling the police to report an alleged crime, Palin took her phone.
According to the KTUU, Palin is currently being held at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility, serving a preventive sentence and $500 bail.
She appeared in court on Saturday and, in her plea, maintained her innocence without a trial, as the network had made known.
Palin has been charged with three Class A misdemeanors, and could face a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor punishable by up to one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, her father, Todd Palin, was charged with assault.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Supreme Court.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of a domestic violence charge, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend testified that he punched him in the face.
When her son's aggressive behavior was coupled with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her experiences in Iraq, Sarah Palin received heavy criticism in 2016.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after a powerful earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami, destroying tens of thousands of homes.
Power and communication networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake shook the central Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Several videos of the moment of impact are circulating on social media.
In fact, due to a beach festival near Palu city, hundreds of people were there when the tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutor wants a special death sentence for a suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people, the last time such a sentence was imposed for a federal crime in the state was in 1953.
The 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot for his attack on the West Side Highway in southern Manhattan; in that October attack, he took out all pedestrians and cyclists before he could.
To justify the death sentence, the prosecution will have to prove that Saipov killed eight people and seriously injured several people, according to the death penalty memorandum filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to legal documents, it would be possible to impose the death penalty in both cases.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, which is the standard used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of motor vehicle violence and vandalism.
The prosecution argued that the attack must have been "pre-planned and planned", as Saipov described it as "cruel".
The actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and losses to the family and friends of the following persons: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, according to the memorandum of intent.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been over a decade since the Southern District of New York last had a death penalty case.
Then, Khalid Barnes was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but eventually, in September 2009, he was sentenced to life in prison.
The last time a federal New York case was sentenced to death was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage against the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were sent to the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to legal documents, the Uzbek Saipov showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators that he felt no guilt for his actions, according to police.
According to the complaint, Saipov told the authorities that the inspiration for the attack was after he saw videos of the ISIS organization on his mobile phone.
He also, according to the police, demanded that the ISIS flag be put up in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 counts of criminal misconduct.
David Patton, who is one of the federal public defenders tasked with representing Saipov, said he was "deeply disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a guilty plea for a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma for the people affected by these events", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier requested that the prosecutor not make a motion for a death sentence.
A Conservative Party MP says Nigel Farage should take over the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage ordered the mobilization of the "people's army" in protest at the Conservative Party conference today.
The former UKIP leader says that politicians should feel the warmth of the Eurosceptics and has been proposed by Theresa May's MPs to take charge of EU negotiations.
As Conservative MP Peter Bone explained to the participants of the Birmingham march, the UK would have been on the sidelines if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the pro-Remain Conservatives have organized an anti-Brexit protest in the city, highlighting Mrs. May's challenge of reconciling the rows of people who are deeply divided.
Prime Minister Chequers is trying to push through her compromise plan, but is under attack from pro-Brexit, pro-Remain and EU supporters.
The Allies believe that he will try to reach an agreement with Brussels, ignoring such reactions, and force the Eurosceptics and the workers to choose between his offer or "chaos".
Mr. Bone explained to the participants of the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that he wants to fire the "Chequers".
He also indicated that he would cooperate with Mr Farage and that he should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out of here by now", he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will defend Brexit, but we have to fire Chequers".
He stated that the Jews were opposed to the war and that the war was not fought to serve anyone.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bone dismissed the change in public opinion since the 2016 election as "a lie that the British have changed their mind and want to stay".
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party and a supporter of Brexit, also attended the march, and explained to reporters: "All I'm saying is, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not known among the citizens, the opposition will not vote for him, he is not known among our party members, and even among our activists who shake the streets and make it possible for us to win elections.
Stop with the Chequers and start listening.
Addressing Mrs. May, he added: "Prime Ministers, in order to continue in office, must keep their word".
Mr. Farage told the demonstrators that they should be warmed up by politicians who are betraying the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"Now this is a matter of trust between our (people) and our political class", he said.
They're trying to derail Brexit, and we're here today to let them know that we're not going to let them get away with it.
Addressing a crowd of passionate supporters, he added: "I want you to warm up our political class who are about to betray Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the people's army that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until the UK becomes independent and self-sufficient and proud".
Meanwhile, pro-Leave protesters marched through Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists held up anti-Brexit posters after the weekend's panel discussion.
His Labour colleague Adonis, whose lordship laughed at the Conservatives at the start of the conference about their security concerns with the party's application.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can make the ICT system work properly, and in Ireland he added Canada plus the whole chain technology, frictionless borderless, free trade".
It's a lie.
There is no good Brexit, she added.
Warren will consider his presidential bid carefully.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "carefully consider" her chances of running for president after the November general election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke at the plenary session held Saturday in the Massachusetts City Hall about her future.
Warren, who is a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican state representative Geoff Diehl, who was the vice chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There's been talk that he might take Trump's place in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was the 36th meeting of Trump's full-council meeting since he took office.
One of the participants asked if he intended to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and to do that, a woman has to be in charge.
A suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting that killed Sims at Louisiana State University.
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting that resulted in the death of Louisiana State University basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference held at 11:00 a.m. eastern time.
He had previously posted a video of the Friday night shooting, asking for help identifying a man who was in it.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot and killed Friday morning near the South Campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which ultimately resulted in his death", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul explained to Saturday's 247sports.
Wayde got into a fight trying to defend a friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was there with a gun in his hand and shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department prison.
The six-foot-three Sims grew up in Baton Rouge, playing in 32 of 10 all-star games last season, and averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton secured the world title on team orders after beating Sebastian Vettel
It became clear on Saturday that since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, the Mercedes team's orders would be life and death in the race.
From the start, Bottas was excellent, and almost sacked Hamilton for defending his place in the first two rounds, and invited his team-mate Vettel to attack.
Vettel entered the pits first, and Hamilton had to be pulled into the traffic at the end of the trope, which should have had a direct impact on the race.
Mercedes entered the pits one lap later and came out from behind Vettel, but after a rally Hamilton took the lead, as the Ferrari driver had released the interior to maintain his position after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who was 21 years old on that day, started the race on the last row of the starting grid and finished the first lap seventh.
He then held on to the lead for much of the race, and by the end, he had held on to the tyres to finish the race fast and to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He eventually made a pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to keep pace for the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's not an easy day, but Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he's been really honest.
"The team has done a great job on the course", said Hamilton.
Those were inappropriate actions.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday for her comment on her failure to leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he said that what was happening in the Senate showed that the people were "horrible, false and liars".
"The only thing that could be certain, and the beautiful thing that's happening in the Senate these last few days, is that you see the anger, you see people who are angry, you see people who are evil, who are fake and liars", he said.
"You see the leaks and the leaks and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak the letter?
Do you remember what he said? Did you leak that letter?
Oh, no, not that.
I didn't leak it.
Well, wait a minute.
"No, we have not leaked", he added, mimicking the senator's reaction.
The letter detailing the details of the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent by Ford to Feinstein in July and leaked last September, but Feinstein has denied that the leak occurred in his office.
"I did not withhold Dr. Ford's testimony, nor did I leak his story", Feinstein explained to the committee, as reported by The Hill.
He asked me to keep it secret, so I kept it secret, as he asked.
But his denial of it was not welcomed by the president, who said during the demonstration on Saturday night: "I will tell you: those were inappropriate gestures.
Maybe it wasn't him, but those were the most inappropriate gestures I've ever seen.
Following the defense of the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They'll do anything to regain power.
They are evil, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to gain power and control, "said the president, according to the Mediaite site.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants, the first team to win the league.
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars recovered on Saturday from the Elite League match they lost to Belfast Giants on Friday, having won the second choice match played at Dundee 5-3.
The Giants won the game, thanks to two goals by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought a tie, but the Giants quickly regained the lead.
Dundee were again drawn by Francois Bouchard, and finally secured victory with two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's boys, who lost 2-1 at Belfast to Dundee.
It was the fourth meeting of the season for both teams, and the Giants had won all three previous games.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth, at 3:35 thanks to a helping hand from Kendall McFaull, and then four minutes later, David Rutherford assisted Beauvillier, who doubled the score.
It was a heated start; in fact, Sullivan brought the tie to 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie and he scored in 15:16.
Dwyer wanted to make sure the Giants got to the first half with the scoreboard on his side, and at the end of the first half, he scored his second goal of the night.
But the home team reorganized, and Bouchard brought the game back to a tie with a goal in 27:37.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen and give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game, and in the end they brought the team to a fifth goal and with it, the victory.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their home game Friday against Milton Keynes.
A flight controller has died on a plane that was evacuating hundreds of passengers after an earthquake.
An Indonesian air traffic controller has become a hero after he died, carrying hundreds of passengers to make sure an airplane took off properly.
More than 800 people have been confirmed dead and many more are missing after a massive earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami that has devastated the island.
Numerous strong aftershocks have occurred in the area, and many are trapped under the rubble of Palu city.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post and flee the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
Instead, he stayed there to ensure that Batik Air flight 6321 could take off properly, which was on the runway at the time.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he saw it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Force spokesman Yohannes Sirait said hundreds of lives were saved by the decision, according to ABC News in Australia.
We built a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a bigger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he left this morning, before the helicopter could reach Palua.
"Our hearts are broken to hear this", she added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could rise to thousands, and the Indonesian Disaster Management Desk says access to Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble and we have not been able to reach many others", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Maje.
Palu has been devastated by waves of up to six metres, and a mass burial is scheduled for Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are delivering relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance full of bodies is arriving.
Pure water is gold.
People are stealing all the food from the small markets.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is working as fast as possible to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is a tragedy, but it could be so much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and explained to the military of the country: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready? Get on CNN.
This year, another earthquake has also struck Indonesia, in the city of Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says a man is missing after his plane crashed into a lake in the Micronesian archipelago.
The airline operating the flight that crashed into a lake in the Pacific in Micronesia now announces that one man is reported missing after it said that 47 passengers and crew had properly evacuated the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was not until Saturday afternoon that it was able to confirm that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to reporters who asked for more details about the passenger (such as name, age or nationality).
Local boats rescued the remaining passengers and crew as they attempted to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk after the plane crashed into the water.
The police said Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were six passengers still in the hospital Saturday night, all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the US military say the plane crashed into a lake near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane went off the runway.
The American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying too low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and other passengers had easily reached the emergency exits of the sinking plane as it flooded into waters reaching down to the waist.
She said the staff were scared and they were fighting, and she had suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Army said that the assistance of fishermen working nearby on the improvement of the dock was also helpful in the rescue effort; for this purpose, an inflatable boat was used to bring the passengers to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the past two decades, but none were caused by Air Niugini.
An analyst has compiled a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive in the city of New York.
The DA's office has postponed the case for the retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive on Saturday, 2014.
Analyst Paul Rowlett, a senior analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of cognitive analysis.
He has told the jury that he used cell phone records to link the accused, Quinton Tellis, 29, and the victim, Jessica Chambers, 19, to their movements on the night of the woman's death.
Rowlett claimed that the woman had received location data from several cell phones that showed her to have been with Tellis Chambers on the night of her death, thus contradicting Tellis' previous confirmation, according to The Clarion Ledger.
The data showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the time Tellis claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford; the police then turned to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the judge on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked Tellis if he was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers two weeks before she died.
But according to cell phone records, they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased it from my life", Hale said.
The defense will begin on Sunday with the final defendants.
The judge said that he's going to the jury box that day.
What is hip-hop consciousness?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge people who have negative views about this type of music by infusing their music with a positive message.
The High Breed from Bristol claim that hip-hop has lost the political messages and social issues that were present in their early work.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip-hop conscious again in the mainstream.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently seen a resurgence of hip-hop in the UK, with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A nanny in New York sued a couple for firing her after a racist post.
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminating against her and for wrongful dismissal after receiving a text message from her mother saying she was not for her and "another black person".
The couple have denied being racist, saying the allegation is "exaggerated".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was surprised to learn that the new employee to look after the children, Giselle Maurice, was black when Maurice arrived home on her first day of work in 2016.
"I'm a white man", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when he realized his mistake, he felt "uncomfortable" with Plasco-Flaxman, and fired Miss Maurice, the former nanny, who was African-American, saying that she was not a good employee and, instead, expected a Filipino nanny.
He paid Miss Maurice for one day's work and then he hired an Uber to take her home.
Now, Maurice has sued the couple and demanded compensation for the damage caused by the dismissal, including $350 a day for six months; after all, even though he was without a contract, he was hired to live in the house and take care of her for six months at a time.
"I want to show them that these things are not done", she explained to the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denies the accusations of racism, and says that Maurice's dismissal was both reasonable and necessary because he was afraid they wouldn't trust him after he insulted them.
My wife sent him something she didn't want me to tell him.
It's not racist.
"We are not racists", Joel Plasco explained to the Post.
But would you leave your own children in the hands of someone you've insulted, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
I'm not going to.
When Plasco said that the allegation was not about Horrenbests, he said that his wife had had a baby for less than two months and that she was in a difficult situation.
You're gonna get a date with that attitude?
That is not a good attitude", the investment banker added.
The legal case is still ongoing, and the tribunal of public opinion has swiftly denounced the couple on social media, punishing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's publishers were afraid they might dislike a talking bear to their readers, as shown by a new letter from the publisher to the editor of the Paddington.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the shoes of someone who read the book for the first time before it was published.
It's so funny to see what we now know about Paddington's huge hit from the first episode.
Her father was a cameraman for the BBC before a tiny teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book; according to her daughter, her father was positive about the rejection of his work, and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication had a "sweet" flavor, as he had died the previous year.
As for Paddington, she says he was "an important member of the family" and that her father was proud of his eventual success.
"He was a quiet man, and not one to brag", he said.
But Paddington was so real to him, that he almost felt like one of your children who accomplishes something that you feel proud of, even if it's not your accomplishment.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although he was a figment of his own imagination, he always credited Paddington with the work.
Her daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
She was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, but the doctors could not save her life.
"Nad called repeatedly to tell him that it was very urgent, that he did not think he would be able to get out", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
And then I get a call from Nad saying that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The doctors kept her heart beating constantly, the medications were gradually wearing down her system.
He died a little bit earlier than I thought, and then it was over.
All I could do was sit and wait, knowing that that's where it all was going to begin.
I couldn't cry or scream, surrounded by my family and people.
I had to.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who had been grieving for her daughter's death for many years, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had forgotten how much she felt sad.
"No one knew", he said.
I was down on my knees, and tears were flowing down my face.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt sorry for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
A group of distressed women hang signs on a bridge to prevent people from committing suicide.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide, they want to prevent more people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up signs on a bridge in Wales with positive messages and numbers for people to call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son, who is now 61, had a gift for cooking and a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said her smile lit up the room.
However, she quit her job right before she died, because she was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there's going to be some kind of domino effect".
Mrs. Davis made some signs so people know that there are people you can talk to about whatever's going on with you and they can help you, even if it's just a friend.
Don't keep silent, you must speak
Mrs. Humphreys and Mrs. Davies have been friends for a long time, and she was also her partner for 15 years, shortly after Mark lost his mother.
"He didn't say he was sad or depressed", he said.
A couple of days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
On Christmas Day, she was upset, and when the children opened their presents, she didn't even look at them.
She said that his death was a big blow to them, but they've got to get over it, because it's left a hole in their family.
It's making us feel depressed.
But we all must go on and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance after an FBI investigation began
"I thought if we could get something like what she was asking for, such as a time-limited or area-limited investigation, maybe we could achieve some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was "disregarding the obstacles that were posed by the passionate partisans".
Why did they refuse to let the FBI take over the case from Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters?
The controversy is about the timing of the event.
There are only five weeks left to the midterm elections on November 6th, in which the Republicans are expected to make a poor showing, which will begin to weaken their man-of-war for the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush made a number of phone calls to senators, pressuring Mr. Kavanaugh to support Mr. Bush, because Mr. Kavanaugh had worked for Mr. Bush in the White House, and through him, he met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has their report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which is currently 51 Republican and 49 Democrat seats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and take the case to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased since Kim's takeover.
The number of people fleeing North Korea to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Department, said 1,127 refugees were admitted last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the imposition of higher fines on human traffickers have had a significant impact.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Almost all North Korean refugees are offered South Korean citizenship sooner or later.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of the refugees have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriated.
North Korea and South Korea are still at war, but relations have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the impasse in the negotiations on denuclearization.
This was preceded in June by the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that the US had not made any progress on the sanctions imposed since then.
"If we don't have any confidence in the United States, we won't have any confidence in our national security, and we won't put down our weapons first", said Mr. Ri in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi told Brett Kavanaugh she's "hysterical" and "not ready to sit on the Supreme Court".
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Brett Kavanaugh a "hysterical" Supreme Court nominee, and she's not ready to be on the Supreme Court in terms of genius.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview with ABC News Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like that, they would have called it 'hysterical'", Pelosi said in her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied sexually assaulting Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening speech, Kavanaugh was so emotional that he would sometimes almost scream and stutter whenever he spoke about his family and early life.
She also explicitly denounced the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against her a "coordinated and insulting smear" by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that Kavanaugh's testimony makes it clear that he can't be on the Supreme Court because he has shown impartiality in his anti-democratic views.
"With these confirmations and his stance against the Clintons and Democrats, he has been out of the league", he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if Kavanaugh were elected and the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives, would she run against him?
"I'll say this: if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not ready to be on the Supreme Court, or in this courtroom right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential for defeat of the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, her conservative approach to justice.
During the reconsideration hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions when asked if he would reverse certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"A hysterical, impartial person cannot go to court and expect that we will take it well", Pelosi said.
And women are to be in charge.
It's a fairy tale, months and years of rage, and he can't let go without crying.
"You cry when you're angry", said Miss Steinem to me 45 years later.
I don't think it's that weird, do you?
And she went on, "And this woman who was a business executive somewhere helped me tremendously, and she told me that she also cries when she's angry, but she had developed a technique that when she gets angry and starts crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, "Oh, because I'm crying, you can think I'm sad.
But I'm mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought, this is a great idea.
Tears are not wrong to see as a way of expressing anger, partly because they are misinterpreted.
I distinctly remember something that happened to me on one of my first jobs, in an office that was mostly men, and I was crying out of rage one time, and an older woman grabbed me by the neck, and I was a little scared of her from the beginning, and the boss was cold, and she led me to the top of the stairs.
"Never let anyone see you cry", she said.
They don't know you have rabies.
They think you're unhappy, and they'll feel good because they've understood you.
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time, and she worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a boat called the Monkey Business and it was discovered that he was having an affair with a woman who was not his wife and he withdrew from the race, Miss Schroeder, devastated, decided to run as his own candidate for the presidency.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he said to me laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called them "White Snow and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because the campaign had been going on for a while, and he was raising money, so he decided he wouldn't run until he had raised $2 million.
The fight was lost.
He learned that some of the followers who had given the men $1,000 had given only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he wondered.
When he gave a speech and announced that he would not campaign officially, he was very moved: gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it so difficult for him to get money and vote for delegates, and anger at his sexist attitude, and finally he stuttered.
"You must have thought I was very nervous", Ms. Schroeder said of the reaction of the press to his behavior.
You must have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my tombstone?
Did she cry?
A trade war between the US and China would benefit Beijing.
The trade spat that marked the beginning of the US-China trade war was a tumultuous one, and despite the heated nature of the conflict, it's very possible that the rifts between the two countries could actually benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump sounded the first warning at the beginning of the year, imposing tariffs on China's main export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant increase comes this week when tariffs affecting over $200 billion in goods will be applied to half of all goods shipped from China to the US.
Beijing has taken retaliatory measures in successive steps, the latest of which is the increase of tariffs between five and ten percent on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods.
China has said it will match every U.S. rise, and the world's second-most powerful economy will not change its mind so easily.
Asking Washington to back down would lead to a formal lawsuit, but publicly capitulating to the U.S. would be even more embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing does the right thing, the US trade war pressures could benefit China in the long run, reducing the dependence of the two economies.
"A hasty decision by politicians in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in either country, which is more dangerous than observers previously thought", said researcher Abigail Grace, who studies Asia with other experts at the US Center for New Security.
Syria is ready to welcome back refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to allow refugees to return voluntarily and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today the situation in the country is more stable and secure due to the progress made in the counter-terrorism process", he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists to ensure that normalcy returns to normalcy as soon as possible.
Now the situation is conducive to allowing refugees, who are returning voluntarily, to return to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and economic restrictions that were limiting their daily livelihood and sustenance.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would appreciate your help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the rebellion.
Europe has received the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
After defeating the U.S. team, which had a final score of 16.5 points to 10.5 points, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup held at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil, and hasn't won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe again took the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA.
American Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, threw his first pitch on the 16th hole of the third, passing it to Francesco Molina.
Italian golfer Milinari was very outstanding in all rounds, and became one of only four players to ever achieve a 5, 0 and 0 result since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth finished 5-4 and was out against the worst player in the European team: the Dane Thorbjorn Olesen.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, went 2-1 against the United States' Ian Poulter, and reached the Ryder Cup final.
Spanish Sergio García, who had played in eight Ryder Cups, became the tournament's leading European winner with 25.5 race points.
I don't normally cry, but today I couldn't help myself.
What a tough year it's been.
So she says she's grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy, just so happy, to have the glass back.
This is a team effort and I am happy that I was able to help", said García, excited after the victory of Europe.
The Spanish John Ram has won the match, defeating the American legend Tiger Woods in a singles match on Sunday (2 to 1).
"I feel so proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, the man I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13, 21, and 3 in the Ryder Cup.
A curious statistic for one of the greatest players ever, who won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to find a way out of this difficult situation, except for the players Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played good quality golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Fury of the U.S.A. said of the team's poor performance, "I'm proud of my boys; they did their best".
This morning, we put pressure on Europe for a few minutes.
It didn't work.
Say hello to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We're gonna get back together, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move forward.
I love all 12 of my boys, and I'm very proud to be their captain.
You have to accept failure.
We're out of here.
