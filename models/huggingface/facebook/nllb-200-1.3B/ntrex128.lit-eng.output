Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they look like puppets
Some Members of the Assembly are protesting the proposal to change their name to MWP (Litt. Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This relates to the intention to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly are concerned that this could cause ridicule at the political level.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned that this was being compared to the TWP and the PP.
For non-Welsh readers: In the Welsh language, twp means wild and pwp means k.
The MEP said the whole group was "dissatisfied" and offered alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative party claimed that its faction was atvira for the name change, but noted that it was an abbreviation of MWP for jelėė.
The letter w in the Welsh language is pronounced similarly to the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly committee, which is currently preparing draft legislation to change the name, said: "The final decision on the names of all Assembly members will of course be up to the members themselves".
In 2017, the Welsh Government Act granted the Assembly of Wales the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on proposals which received strong support for the Assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
As regards the nomination of the members of the Assembly, the Commission gave preference to the Welsh Members of Parliament or WMP, but the MWP received the most support during the public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are clearly offering alternatives, but the effort to reach an agreement could become a headache for the presiding officer, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the amendments in a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the Assembly's work, including rules on disqualification of an Assembly member and a plan for the committee system.
When debating legislation, the members of the Assembly shall have a decisive vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote was held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to Greek territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's aspirations to join the EU and NATO.
Opposing the referendum on the name change, President of Macedonia Gyorge Ivanov said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that the name change is simply a price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
During the Troubles in Harlem, the bells of St. Martin's and other churches were stopped
"The old people I spoke to said that historically, you could find a bar and a church on every corner", Adams said.
You can't find either one today.
He said it was understandable why the bars disappeared.
"People are communicating differently these days", he said.
The bar is no longer a neighborhood site where people congregate all the time.
Speaking of churches, he worries that the money from selling property won't last as long as the leaders hope, and sooner or later they'll go back to where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by multi-room cooperative apartments, where people would live who would not help the remaining shrines.
"The majority of people who buy co-op flats in these apartment buildings will be white", he said, "and therefore will hasten the moment when the church closes completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into these co-op flats will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built in 1870 by white congregations, before Harlem became a black metropolis within the Metropolis Community, and St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation came into being in the 1930's.
The name was changed to the building by a black congregation who held a meeting nearby.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation with the clergyman John Howard Johnson leading a retail boycott of 125th Street, Harlem's main store, which refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939 the building was badly damaged by fire, but as the parishioners of the late Father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they commissioned a carillon.
The clergyman David Johnson, the son of the late father of Johnson and heir to the church of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon the bell of the poor.
The experts who played the carillon in July called it a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also mentioned that this was the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysius A. Lind, who had begun playing the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years earlier.
Merriweather said St. Martin's Church didn't replace him with another musician.
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin's has been a complicated history involving architects and contractors, some invited by the laity of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish's governing body, consisting of lay leaders, expressed concern to the diocese in July that the diocese would try to pay the costs to the sacristy, even though it had not hired the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
A shark in California injured a lobster-catching 13-year-old
A 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday as he was catching lobsters on the opening day of the California lobster season, officials said.
He was attacked just before 7:00 a.m. in Ensinitas, near Lightning Beach.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV that he and his friends were diving for about a half hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then came with a group to help him out of the water.
Hammel told me at first that the boy was excited to catch the lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I got bit!"
I got a bite!
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicle was dislocated.
I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was airlifted to San Diego's Radical Children's Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked the boy.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Officials have closed the beach from Casablanca Point to Ensinitas Swami for 48 hours for investigation and protection.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered to be endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's will take over from Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with a full-service beauty department staffed by specialist consultants.
In a bid to actively target the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow and sales of fashion and household goods are falling, larger beauty units will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added next year.
Investment in beauty is growing, and shopping malls are looking for ways to replace shelves that were once used for TVs, microwaves, and household items.
Sainsbury's announced that it would double its beauty range to 3,000 product names, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Twizerman and for the first time Dr. Pawpaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will also be given more local brands in areas similar to those found in shops such as Boots.
The mall also relaunched its Boutique make-up range, with most products being vegan  and increasingly being sought after by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will be testing discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second later this year in Sealy Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and the desire to buy small quantities of local essentials on a daily basis mean that shopping centres must do more to attract people to visit.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe said that retailers are increasingly looking like convenience stores as the chain tries to compete with cheaper Aldi and Lidl stores by offering more services than food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos sales to hundreds of stores and has also set up a number of Habitat stores, as it bought both chains two years ago, which reportedly boosted food sales and made their acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt by the mall to rebuild its beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
In the early 1990s, Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots, but the union ended in a dispute over how to distribute the proceeds from the drugstore shops in the malls.
The new strategy follows the sale of Sainsbury's' 281 stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125m three years ago.
It was claimed that Lloyds' contribution to this scheme was to include an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's's chief commercial officer, said: "We have changed the exterior and the atmosphere of the beauty department to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained colleagues who would be willing to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet every need, and our attractive environment and convenient locations have made us an attractive beauty spot challenging the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has terminated his £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, star of Dragon's Den, is upset after TV presenter Holly Willoughby cut an £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on a new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Mr. Willoughby has no time for their household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left a profitable lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her big new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, infuriating Dragon's Den star Peter Jones.
Sources say Jones was upset when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday, the golden TV girl at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that new deals of up to £1.5m would leave her with no time for his household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand of Goop and was thought to have doubled Willoughby's £11m fortune.
Since 37-year-old H Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving True, Jones flew out of the UK for one of his summer vacations.
The source said that "Truly" has been one of Holly's top priorities so far.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, spanning the next couple of decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday because the beginning was so close.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods at Marlou's headquarters.
Experts say that the departure of the host of The Morning, one of Britain's most financially successful stars, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the delay in starting everything.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
For a decade, mother of three, H. Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, maintained close ties with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
In 2016, Willoughby and Cappu founded Truth, and Jones, 52, joined the fight as chairman.
The couple are on vacation together, and Mr. Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin Television Productions.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and replace the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity, Anna McPartlin.
A source close to Jones said yesterday, "We're not going to comment on his business dealings".
We had a great conversation and we fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism he received for the comment, which some might consider "unpresidential", and for the positive comments about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
In a brief, confused voice, the news anchor said,
I didn't say no.
He mentioned that Kim was interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June was a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is not receiving a response from the United States regarding its early disarmament.
He noted that the US instead continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
In his speech, the short man expressed a much more optimistic viewpoint.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
We have this great relationship now.
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, including the end of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return home of the bodies of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual attitude when he spoke about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd better have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd standing directly in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, this was not declared a national disaster  a necessary condition for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that there was no need for international aid, so it's a bit complicated", Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign staff will be able to work there.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Sutopo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Indonesia is still sadly unprepared for the ravages of nature, given the constant earthquakes it experiences.
Although tsunami shelters were installed in Aceh, they are not common on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu likely increased the number of lives lost despite the warning.
Traveling between the many islands of Indonesia at the best time is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship in Lombok, which is treating earthquake victims, is heading for Palu, but it will not reach the new disaster site for at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the rebuilding of Indonesia's devastated infrastructure the focus of his election campaign, spending generously on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has not given peace of mind to Joko's administration, as he will be running for re-election next year.
Joko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims adhere to a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and other simple weapons.
Watch: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a long-range goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
With their team down 1-0, Xherdan Shaqiri passed the ball about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal to former Sturridge.
He threw the ball over his left foot and hit the far corner.
The ball, which was lifted high above the penalty area, flew into the upper right corner of the net.
He finally flew over the jumping Cape Arrizabalaga and reached the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to stay as long as possible for the shot", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante running, I fixed the ball with one touch, and without thinking too much, I just spit.
After Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute, Chelsea took the lead 1-0 from the first inning.
During that attack, the Blues striker returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the middle of the field and rushed towards Liverpool.
This one in the middle of the square quickly hit a wall.
The goalkeepers then sent the ball through the opponents' court to Hazard's penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defender and passed Liverpool player Alison Becker with a left foot kick to the net at the far end.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are playing against Videotron in London at 3pm on Thursday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported earlier Sunday.
A spokesman for the agency, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed after Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which caused a 6-meter wave.
The city of Palu, home to over 380,000 people, was displaced by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was fatally stabbed
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Berkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. outside Grayson Meuse, John Street, with a 32-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone who has seen or heard people in the area to come forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "It's early days, but I'd like to appeal to anyone who's been near John Street in Berkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who might have caught something on the VCR and contact us, as they may have information that is essential to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Berkenhead and was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends who knew the woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing as police have announced that they are informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver in Grayson, Mo., just tried to get back to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He broke his promise when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now being told that they will have to wait several hours before being allowed to return home.
A police officer was heard explaining to one person that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
The woman turned up at the scene disguised.
She kept saying, "It's so awful".
At 2 p.m., two police vans were parked outside the barrier on the inside and another van was behind it on the outside.
Many officers stood inside the barrier and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to write @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 using the number 247 dated 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell is dealt the final blow in a dispute over the rewrite of history.
Its removal would be poetic justice for the destruction of England's cultural and religious heritage, reminiscent of the Taliban, which is being carried out by the fanatical followers of Cromwell's Puritans.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as "stupid" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the statue's relocation, the statue of Oliver Cromwell at Westminster Palace was bound to be the target.
Cromwell did not order or carry out iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of Grandfather Tom in the last century.
The stunning image of Cromwell, created by Sir William Hamm Thorneycroft, reflects the 19th-century attitude and historiography of a figure who is still revered by many.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "For many people, perhaps more so in the late 19th century than today, Cromwell was seen as the protector of Parliament from outside pressure, and that, of course, was monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is still debated by historians.
One thing is certain, the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell became a unique figure representing one of the faces of this tacosphere.
His achievements as a Lord's defender are also worthy of mention and praise.
Pig killer stabbed to death Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and stabbed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the Morning Post reported that a man named Yuan was found dead, bleeding from a ruptured artery, lying next to a piglet in a market in Luopanshu, Guizhou Province, southern China.
On 30 May 2005 a pig farmer in Singe, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to inject a vaccine into pigs in pigs.
He reported that he and his cousin from the neighboring province of Junano were going to sell 15 pigs at the market on Wednesday.
The next morning, the cousin found the dead relative and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said there was a big hole in the pig's mouth, soaked in blood.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilograms had bitten the farmer.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and wounded", said the cousin, who gave his name as Wu.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that stabbed the man was not Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig had to be locked up to prevent it from attacking other people and kept in custody while police gather evidence on the spot.
It's reported that the Yuan family and the market's management are negotiating a death benefit.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig pressed on a Welsh farmer's tractor and pressed until the animal was killed by his wife.
After pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger aggression.
They're just playful.
They're very curious, very cheeky... and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to respect them accordingly, he said.
Hurricane Rosa's remnants will bring heavy rain to the southwest United States.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves through the colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to all of northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
As of 5 a.m. Sunday, Rose was moving at 137 miles per hour as a Category 1 hurricane, and was 620 miles southwest of Cape Euchenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a thick area of low pressure is forming in the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward toward the U.S. west coast, and as Rosa approaches the California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to carry heavy tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching thick low-pressure area, will bring heavy rainfall to the southwest over the next few days.
Instead, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 centimeters will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible desert landslides.
The high humidity of the tropics will cause rainfall of 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in some areas, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 58 centimetres is expected in southwestern regions, especially in a large part of Arizona.
The tropical nature of the rainfall has led to the possibility of sudden flooding and rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of a tropical storm, it would be especially unwise to go into the desert on foot.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms can create wind and dust.
The approaching thickening of the low pressure area will bring some local heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Rainfall of more than 1 cm is expected, which may cause a small debris flow and may lead to slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some heavy rainfall will begin to approach the Arizona thunderstorms on Sunday and early Monday, and then rain will fall late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall across Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah will spread Tuesday and continue Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature fluctuations are expected across the United States as the Arctic cools, but the tropics will be fairly warm.
Sometimes this causes large temperature changes over short distances.
Sunday was a prime example of the huge temperature differences in the central United States.
Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, are almost 20 degrees warmer than St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat is expected to rise again over the next few days, taking in more areas.
A warm summer is expected for much of the central and eastern United States, from the Great Plains to the northeastern regions, with temperatures reaching as high as 80 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C] in many places.
New York City is expected to see temperatures reaching 27 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that temperatures in the eastern United States will be higher than the average for the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the sensational remarks Thursday on six television broadcasts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the sexual assault allegations of Christine Blasey Ford in the 1980s.
But the political deadlock continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programming over Friday's last-minute change: The Arizona senator drafted a deal for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into bribery allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh, who was naked at the high school party, had abducted her and tried to strip her.
Kavanaugh angrily testified that he was absolutely certain it wasn't.
Nielsen reported on Friday that the broadcast was viewed by more than 20.4 million people, possibly.
The company calculated the average number of viewers watching the broadcast on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in counting people watching television in offices.
To put it simply, I understand that this is the same size of an audience that would be formed during a replay of a football game or an Oscar.
Nielsen reported that Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's candidacy, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the day's trial.
ABC, with 3.26 million viewers, was second.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3,1 million viewers, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89 million and CNN 2,52 million.
The great interest remained after the trial.
The central figure in Friday's drama was Flake.
After a small Republican office released a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as protesters shouted at him as he tried to climb the elevator to a Judiciary Committee meeting.
CNN filmed him live with his eyes down as he was flooded.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told: "You have power when so many women are powerless".
Flack said that his office had issued a statement and, before closing the elevator, added that he would have more to say at the Judiciary Committee meeting.
Later, cable and cable networks discussed live when the Judiciary Committee voted for Kavanaugh's Senate nomination.
However, Flake said he would only do so knowing that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate within the next week, which the Democratic minority had called for.
Flake, after talking to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, was somewhat convinced.
After consulting with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flack's choice was powerful because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
UK Prime Minister accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused her plans to leave the European Union of playing politics with Britain's future and of harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published after her photo on the front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson further attacked her so-called Brexit-themed "Shakespeare" plan that Britain and the EU should charge each other tariffs, saying it was "absurd".
Police have arrested suspect Dytone Simpson in connection with the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released video of Sims and Simpson fighting, and police mentioned that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The WAFB reports that police have recovered the glasses from the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he shot Wayde to death.
His attorney informs us that his bail is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head, a bullet to the neck.
The department is awarding the awards to the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the residents of the area who assisted in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the district law enforcement for their "corruption and justice".
Sims was 20.
The 6-foot-9 kid grew up in Baton Rouge, where his dad Wayne also played basketball at LSU.
Last season, the youngster averaged 5.6 points per game and 2.6 rebounds per game.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "overblown and shocked".
"You think about it all the time", Wade said.
A volcano carves ash in Mexico City
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday after it was spotted with active activity and 183 gas and ash discharges recorded in 24 hours.
The center has seen a lot of tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show car windshields covered in a thin layer of ash in Mexico's suburbs, such as Chochimilke.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital when a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, the police made a deal with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters struck a deal with riot police and thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catalonia-backed secession vote.
Police were sprayed with eggs and powdered paint to stop the masked separatist group from rioting, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Police used batons to break up the fighting that began later that day.
Within hours, a group of independence activists chanting "Unforgettable, Unforgivable" were confronted by unionists shouting "Long live Spain!"
Local media reported that 14 people were being treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum of 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but which is being celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region that seeks independence.
Most voters chose to become independent, but voter turnout was low due to the large number of people who boycotted the vote and did not want to secede.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations.
A pro-independence group set up a camp on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to change course.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer sure about the prospects for Catalan independence.
Last year was one of the best times we've ever had.
I watched the parents cheerfully shout out for the right to vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Despite a vital and hard-won victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalonia's independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many of their most prominent leaders retreating into voluntary exile or being detained and awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joann Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who supports the police, who filmed the protest on his phone, said that the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is growing", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders imprisoned in a pre-trial prison since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
'Candidating for the European Parliament elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression demonstrated by the Spanish government,' he said.
Londoners, arrest the men who entered the house in a car.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after they re-entered a house in London.
The incident occurred at about 7.30pm on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the building were damaged.
At some point, the car could also have been hit by a crossbow.
Menga's shot secured a 1-0 win for Livingston against Rangers.
The first shot of Dolly Mengo at Livingston guaranteed the win.
Livingston's promotion to the top flight surprised Rangers, forcing incumbent manager Steven Gerrard to lose the second of 18 games.
Dolly Mengo's strike proved to be a big one, because in an instant, Gary Holt's team was compared to Hibernian.
Gerrard's side are unbeaten in the Premier League this season and will face the Hearts on Sunday, eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will play their Europa League home game against Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended their unbeaten streak in the division to six, and head coach Holt has yet to taste the loss, as Kenny Miller was replaced only last month.
Livingston's lost his chances in the game against the upright guests.
Even before hitting the goal, Holt's team, due to their tenacity, which causes Rangers various problems, should have been ahead for a long time.
Scott Robinson first slipped and hit the goal, then Alan Lithgow slipped and missed the ball that was passed to Craig Halkett's head and landed near the goal.
The hosts were not worried about letting the Rangers play in the front, knowing that they could cause problems for the guests by creating standard positions.
That is how the decisive blow was struck.
The Rangers missed a free kick and Livingston started to bounce forward, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly passing the ball to Meng, who stopped it and earned a kick from the middle of the penalty area.
Since then, the Rangers have been in control of the ball for a long time, but the home defense has been invincible and goalkeeper Liam Kelly has had little to do.
The game continued in the second half, although Kelly had to work on a late kick from Alfredo Morelos.
Scott Pittman's shot was blown by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's leg, and after another standard Lithgow shot, the ball flew right through the goal.
The ball was permanently in the Livingston penalty area when passed, but was occasionally spit out, and two penalty requests were not met, one for Halkett's collision with Glenn Middleton, who had run into the pitch after the substitution, and the other for touching the ball with his hand.
Analysis of the appearance of the phenomenon Livingstone
This is Alasdair Lamont from Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal game and score at Livingston.
They were all great and continued to exceed expectations for an ever-improving game.
The style of play and the staff have hardly changed since returning to the top flight, but Holt deserves a lot of credit for starting the team.
He was fought by many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a great player, putting together a well-organized defense, and Meng kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they are playing well under Gerrard, this time they were far from reaching their level.
They've made few decisive shots and only once have they managed to get past the home defense, which is a bit of a concern for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in different ways in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there was a smile and a blue sky as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
The leaders debated issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a new huge mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have banned 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also sought to be heard in condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to their country.
The different protests show the division of the visitors: some German Turks consider him a hero, while others mock him and call him a dictator.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in Deptford.
A cyclist died in London after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on the busy Deptford Road, southeast of the city, at approximately 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred several months after another cyclist was killed on Childers Street by a hit-and-run driver, about a mile (1.6 km) from the accident on Saturday.
City police said officials are working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roads are closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Six officers injured in riot at Long Lartino prison
Prison officials say six officers were injured in a major altercation at the high-security men's prison.
The incident took place at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 0930 hours BVL, where it is still ongoing.
Special Tornado officers have been called in to control the riot, which involves eight prisoners and takes place in one wing of the prison.
Officers are being treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said, "Specially trained prison staff have been called to HMP Long Lartin to manage the ongoing incident.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are ensuring that those responsible will be handed over to the police and, possibly, spend longer time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
Riot police were called to the prison last October to handle a serious riot in which some workers were hit with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash flooding.
It's not unusual for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen next week when Hurricane Rose with its remaining energy blasts through the southwest desert, creating a risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, spreading south and east into Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
With thunderstorms expected Monday with rain, Rose will head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday.
In Phoenix, the National Weather Service reported that only 70 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or tropical depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane no more than 40 miles [64.0 km] from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 510 centimeters in April, and rainfall of 5 centimeters in some areas of Arizona's Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to experience between 2.5 and 5 centimeters of rainfall, and in some places up to 10 centimeters of rainfall may occur.
For people who are not threatened by flash floods, the Rose Rain can be a blessing, since the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a serious problem, some people may benefit from the rainfall, as the southwest is currently suffering from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is heading for the coast across the entire Mexican peninsula of California.
On Sunday, Rose, still a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour [137 km/ h], is 619 miles south of Cape Euchenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour [19 km/ h].
The storm is a severe one because it is encountered in the cooler waters of the Pacific.
So it's expected to make landfall on the Mexican coast with tropical storm strength by Monday afternoon or evening.
The precipitation in some parts of Mexico can be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
From the California peninsula to northwest Sonora, rainfall is expected to be about 815 centimeters, but possibly up to 25 centimeters, weather.com reported.
Then Rose will move north across Mexico as a tropical storm, then reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, and on Tuesday evening, it will move across Arizona toward southern Utah.
"The main threat from Rosa or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in the California Peninsula, northwest Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert", the National Hurricane Center said.
These showers are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods, landslides in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
The attack on Midsomer Norton, four people arrested on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the area of the Midsamer Norton Excelsior Terrace, at approximately 4:00 a.m., according to BVL, Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police have announced that a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in the Radstock area overnight.
Officials are reaching out to anyone who may have any cell phone footage of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's slander, anger.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said in his speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh, during his run, experienced the Democratic Party's ugliness, anger.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress Thursday in a strong and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in support of his allegations.
On Saturday, the president said that the American people had seen that day how great, how noble, how brave Kavanaugh was.
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a credible reputation in public service", he told the West Virginia crowd.
The president made an indirect reference to Kavanaugh's candidacy, while also talking about the importance of Republican campaign activity in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
I'm not participating, although I am, he said.
That's why I'm always fighting for the best candidates.
Trump said the Democrats are trying to resist and hinder.
A senior GOP aide told CNN that the first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination should be no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, casualties continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of them stranded, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said.
Hundreds of people gathered for the Palu City Beach Festival on Friday when the waves, six meters high, began to roll ashore at dusk, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"People were still on the beach when the tsunami threat came out yesterday and they didn't run away immediately, so they became victims", BNPB Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told reporters during a news briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it pulled cars, poles, houses, it hit everything on the ground", said Nugroho, adding that before hitting the coast, the tsunami was traveling at 500 miles per hour in the open ocean.
He said that some people climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs taken by the National Disaster Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to shake with repeated strikes on Saturday.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) reported that the energy released by Friday's particularly powerful earthquake was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
It is reported that the tsunami may have been intensified by the city's geographical location, as it is located at the end of a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho described the damage as "Big Bang" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found trapped under the collapsed buildings, later adding that 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coast, 300 kilometers north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Nugroho said the communications networks were completely paralyzed, so there was no information from Dongla.
"There are more than 300 000 people living there", a Red Cross spokesperson said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are on their way to the disaster-affected areas.
It has been said that this is a tragedy, but it could get worse.
The agency was heavily criticized on Saturday for not reporting that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came after a warning was issued.
In a social media fan clip, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building yelling at people on the street below about an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall will hit the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to confirm the footage immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami cut power supply, cut communications around Palu, and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
Authorities said the military has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities with relief supplies, but the evacuees still have a desperate need for food and other basic necessities.
The City Airport has been reopened for aid purposes only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeded 800.
This is very bad.
Doseba reported that as World Vision staff traveled safely from Donggala to Palu City, where they are housed in the green tents in the backyard, they were met with devastating images along the way.
They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses, he said.
This is very bad.
Even when aid groups began to take complex steps to provide relief in the disaster, some people complained that experienced foreign aid workers were banned from traveling to Pallu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and foreign personnel can only help when the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a provincial-level disaster", Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, told reporters.
 When the government says:  Yes, this is a national disaster, we can call for international aid, but that status has not yet been declared.
On the second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Palu on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing people were hoping that their loved ones would become part of a miracle that would change the history of natural disasters.
A little boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Indonesia's national parachuting team coach Gendhon Subandono had trained two missing parachutists at the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others trapped at the Ro Ro Hotel, including Mangan, were his students.
"Being a senior in parachute sports, I carry my own emotional burden", he said.
Gendon explained how within hours of announcing the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, the news spread throughout the parachuting community, and he desperately sent messages via his WhatsApp app to the Palu contestants attending the beach festival.
But his messages were one gray raven, not two blue ravens.
"I think that means the messages weren't received", he said.
While filling out an ATM, a thief at the Newport on the Levee stole $26,750
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, a thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was loading an ATM at the Newport on the Levee.
"The driver of the car was a full-size ATM at the amusement park and ready to add more money", Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
While he was busy, another man ran from behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended to replenish the stash.
According to the press release, witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the crime.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
The rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
After announcing the change on his Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: "Person formerly officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known as Ye for some time and has named his eighth album after it, which was released in June.
The change began before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where West was expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
He's replacing singer Arianne Grand, who canceled the show for emotional reasons, the show's creator said.
It's not just an abbreviation of the current professional name. West has said before that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means tu, as West said earlier this year when discussing the title of an album with Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, that means us.
It started with Kanye, which means the only one, and it became just Ye, which means the good, the bad, the confused, the whole thing.
The album is more about who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers to have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the names Love and Brotherly Love.
West's former colleague Jay-Z also changed his name and used it with or without a hyphen and in capital letters.
Mexican politician Andrés Manuel López Obradores (AMLO) has pledged not to use troops against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
López Obrador promised Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he would never use military force to discourage the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, as leftist student movements were beginning throughout Latin America, military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in a square, killing 300 people.
López Obradores has solemnly promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly student subsidies and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal groups.
The US should double its funding for AI
"As China becomes more active in AI, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area", says AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various US government agencies published reports on AI, even though the US has no official AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China last year presented its plan to lead AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are more advanced than the US and are waiting for another breakthrough in AI", said Lee.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next big AI breakthrough being in the U.S., as Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The AI Superpower: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China's most prominent AI companies, Face+++.
In the 1990s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top American Othello player, and later he was head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's "Robotics Challenge", and in an effort to help find more visionary people, asked when the next one would be.
Lee argued that US researchers often have to struggle to win government grants.
"It's not China that's taking away academic leaders, it's companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired brilliant university minds to work with AI in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the US to strengthen its efforts on AI.
"I think that PhD students working in the field of artificial intelligence should be automatically offered green cards", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China announced its New Generation AI Development Plan.
In addition, Lee said that the Chinese National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to scientists in the US, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, no action has been taken in the coming months on U.S. legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is home to the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour implies a claim to Greek territory and vetoes Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments agreed on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists say that changing the name would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gyorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign has expressed doubts that voter turnout will reach the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to take effect.
The referendum question on the ballot: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership if Greece agrees to the deal?"
The supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaeva, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price to pay for joining institutions like the EU and NATO.
"Today I come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely, protected by the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will stick to the results of the vote and make them decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament would be required to change the name.
The state election commission reported no reports of violations as of 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Gose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duško vote in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and pulled chairs in front of tents set up by the referendum boycott.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not come through the servants' doors", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If you don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and participate in Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership in Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent, will attract much-needed investment.
"I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said the result would be the security of our future.
According to the results of a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, the turnout in the referendum is expected to be 3043%  less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents were preparing to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote "Yes".
For a referendum to be successful, it must be approved by 50 percent of the voters plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious policy failure of a pro-Western government since it took office last May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero takes all of Brighton's defence and goal scoring
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defence, and Manchester City won 2-0 at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, which looked incredibly easy.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field at the start of the attack.
Before being thrown into the open, he was passed by three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero is surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He had slipped past one defender, having previously overtaken several others at the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling's left.
The English striker returned the ball from the penalty area with a single spin and Aguero released the ball into the right side of the net with a right foot kick, beating Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan.
Aguero has a foot problem, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about him playing 55-60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky that he was able to gain a foothold at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who helped the Sky Blues to their first ever promotion in this Premier League match.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero was hit in the attack while he was deep in the ground at Brighton.
On the left side of the field, between two opponents, he handed the ball to Leroy Sanchez.
Sanchez threw a few spins forward, while Sterling stepped to the far end.
The Sky Blues' kicker released the ball into the goal just before he left the field.
On Tuesday at 12.55pm, City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Zinsheim Arena in Rhein-Neckar, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a friendly game with the Rockies.
After the Nationals dropped out of the relegation play-offs, there was no reason to push the weights again.
Competitively, Scherzer hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to stay in the playoffs; in the National League West, they are one point behind the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies, who beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday night, have at least secured a chance at a trip to the playoffs, but they'll still have to work hard to secure their right to play in the top flight.
Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we'll be able to rush out onto the field knowing that the atmosphere in Denver, where the crowd and the other team will be gathered, is probably the highest level we can reach this year.
Why don't you get dressed?
The starting line-up for Sunday's match has not yet been announced, but they are clearly in the process of throwing the ball to release Scherzer.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the standings this season, has started his throwing practice on Thursday and will take his usual rest day on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander is 18-7, with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
A short speech in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections, the president is referring indirectly to the situation surrounding the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Everything we've accomplished will be on the scales in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
It's very, very important, I don't run... but I do run, which is why I'm fighting for the best candidates everywhere", he said.
And he went on, "Well, you see this awful, awful bunch of Democrats, you see this happening right now.
And they're determined to regain power by any means, you see how low it is, how angry.
They don't care what they've hurt, what they've gone through to get power and control; that's what they really want -- power and control -- but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to resist and obstruct.
And you've seen it for the last four days, he's been talking about, calling Democrats angry, ugly, low-minded, unjust people.
He pointed to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which caused a huge ovation from the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, how about that?
No, um... no, I'm waiting for one. That was really bad body language. Worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour has lost its diversity of opinion.
They do not tolerate those who openly express their opinions
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to distrust me, I was surprised.
I am finally the latest Labour MP to be told I am unwelcome, and that is for expressing my opinion.
My colleague, Senator Joan Ryan, has received similar threats because she has been a staunch opponent of anti-Semitism.
I was criticized for not meeting Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, the importance of national security, the importance of Europe, ironically, the kind of issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that we want to see more members involved and productive meetings.
For most of the eight years that I've been a local Labour MP, Friday night GC meetings have been exactly like this.
It is sad that the tone of many meetings today is not at all the same and the promises of a milder, more favourable policy have long been forgotten, even if they were ever implemented at all.
It is increasingly apparent that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues, who I thought had similar political views, started to expect me to turn 180 degrees and hold opinions I would never agree with, whether it was on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, and no matter what, there's a barrage of insults on social media, encouraging my dismissal, condemning the politics of the centre and saying I don't belong in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I'm a lot luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments I'm getting are political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist and racist insults every day.
One of the most disappointing things about this political era is how abusive speech has become a normal occurrence.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the same party, and with every vote of no confidence or change in the electoral system, this party is getting smaller.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years, not to dance, not to talk so loud, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, provoked by the negligence of the Thatcher government, which literally destroyed my whole school class, I have sought to win better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East should have been surprised by my political views and disagreements with the current leaders in the field.
To those who pushed this process on Friday, I can say that as the country is digging towards Brexit, with households, businesses and public services suffering, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But actually, one message I have for the Nottingham Moment to my constituents, Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political expediency will stop me from acting in my convictions and in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
The Irish are the champions of the table.
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final results, but there is no doubt that Ireland deserved this moment of triumph in the spectacular, promise-taking games of Tennent's Premiership Day.
Now the team is at the top of the table, the only one not affected.
The final victory was won by a flawless defense and well-used opportunities, so Coach Peter Murchie can truly feel satisfied.
"We've done all the tests in all the matches that have been played so far, and we're still not impressed, so I'm really happy", he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: "We played well, the players took their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, scored by Frazier Climo, took the Ayres to the lead, but a yellow card for Scot Rory Hughes, who was sent off by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to collect the numbers and Baggot to stop the scoreless attempt.
Climo increased the Irish lead with a penalty, having scored points in the middle of the race and successfully completed the personal test, helping Ireland to extend their lead to 17-5 before half-time.
However, Melrose's second leg started well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggott successfully completed, narrowed the gap to five points.
The match was suspended for a longer period as Ruaridh Knott suffered a serious injury and was sent off the pitch on a stretcher.
Ireland captain Blair MacPherson was given a yellow card and Melrose tried to take advantage of the excess players, but Bruce Colvin's attempt at the end of the decisive pressure was unsuccessful.
The home team player returned, but after Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for stopping Clima without a ball, MacPherson pressed the ball from the penalty line in place of the continuing "Air" balls.
Climo successfully completed his attempt, as he had done almost since the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe stopped David Armstrong's spinner in the corner of the field and prevented winger Gregor Henry from making his fifth home team attempt to score points.
Still Game star, looks set to start a new career in the restaurant industry
"Still Game" star Ford Kiernan appears poised to make the transition to the hospitality industry after it was revealed that he's been appointed CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, writing and starring alongside his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's last, and it looks like Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglund.
According to official data, he became a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although sources in the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan was looking for ways to get involved in Glasgow's booming restaurant business.
We own the sea: landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen the way to the ocean
The sailors are on patrol at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
A flag of ocean grey is waving over public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases are decorated with the slogan: "The sea is our rightful possession".
It's our duty to get her back.
All over land-locked Bolivia, memories of the access to the ocean that Chile had to sacrifice in the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources are still alive and longing to be re-discovered in the Pacific.
The hopes that have been built up in recent decades are now especially strong as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision, due to be announced on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia is focused on the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, hopes for positive results", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivian citizens across the country will watch the announcement of the ICC ruling on large screens, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will rule in favour of Bolivia's complaint  Chile will be obliged to negotiate on Bolivia's state access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian Indian president who faces a controversial re-election battle, is also keenly interested in what the Monday decision will bring.
We are very close to the opportunity to return to the Pacific, he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts tend to believe that it is unlikely that the court will reach a decision in favor of Bolivia, and even if it did, little would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no jurisdiction to map the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the possible outcome of the negotiations.
The fact that the ECJ decision will be published only six months after the last arguments were heard hardly indicates that the case has not been complex, said Paz Zárate, an expert in international law from Chile.
And even if Bolivia had made some progress, the last four years could have blocked it back.
This issue of illegal access to the sea was raised by the current Bolivian administration, he said in Zarate.
She believes that any remnants of Chilean goodwill have been destroyed by Morales's vengeful rhetoric.
Bolivia and Chile will extend the dialogue at some point, but after all this, it will be very difficult to discuss.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
"On Monday, Bolivia will have an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and to end 139 years of disagreements for mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales is still one of the most popular Latin American presidents, and uses the sea issue as a political manipulation.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific", he added.
A decision is an opportunity to see that we have to come to terms with the past.
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament is possible only if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho assures that his nation will never be the first to give up nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to uphold the commitments made by the leaders of the rival countries at their meeting in Singapore.
His comments came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be reopening stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says that the utopian dream is that with the continuation of sanctions and the US withdrawal of the declaration of the end of the Korean War, North Korea could one day be dismantled.
Washington is avoiding the declaration unless Pyongyang takes a credible disarmament action first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have a second meeting.
But there is a widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is not serious about giving up an arsenal that it seems to see as its only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for a second Kim-Trump meeting.
The Paris fashion show revealed that the latest trend is massive headwear, and they will soon conquer the nearest fashion stores
If you want to add to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun completely, this trend is for you.
Designers Valentino and Thomas Browne's 2019 spring and summer collections showcased a wide range of eccentrically large headwear, and he simply stunned the audiences of Paris Fashion Week with his style.
These particularly impractical hats captured the attention of the social networking site Instagram this summer, and these designers have put their eye-catching pieces on the stage.
Valentino's signature design was a large, body-colored hat with a wide, feathery edge that covered the head of a mannequin.
Other non-standard-sized accessories included gem-studded watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even pineapples. But they were not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thomas Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks at the same time as Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were lipstick-wrapped and more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of the creatures looked like a snake suit, with a tube and underwater glasses, and the other looked like a melting ice pack.
And if you follow this huge fashion trend, you won't be able to paint.
Fashion experts speculate that these huge covers may be making their way into stores.
The big hats became popular with the La Bomba heels, and the two-legged straw hats were worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand, which has created extremely unconventional hats that have taken over all social networks, has unveiled another huge piece of work - a straw-sized beach bag, almost the size of a swimsuit-wearing mannequin.
The red brick raffle bag, decorated with raffle corners and a white leather handle, became the exclusive highlight of the Jacquemou collection at La Riviera SS19 Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think next summer, the stores will be bringing in huge hats and beach bags because the designer has made such an impact, so it would be hard to ignore the need for extra-sized accessories".
John Edward: Language proficiency  a vital skill for citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland improved their academic achievement records without falling in 2018 and again demonstrated outstanding test results, which were only further enhanced by individual and collective achievements in sport, the arts, music and other community achievements.
With over 30 000 pupils in total across Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), aim to provide the highest level of service to their pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and to be global citizens.
Working in the education sector, which can design and implement the school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and are being chosen willingly in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, he will understand you in your mind".
If you speak to him in his own language, you will speak to his heart.
It's a powerful reminder that we can't rely on English alone if we want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
And we can say, based on the results of the last exams this year, that languages are at the top of the popularity charts and independent schools have the best retention rates.
Overall, 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language received the highest A-levels.
Data collected from 74 schools that are members of SCIS showed that 72% of pupils received the highest A-rating in the Mandarin language exam, 72% of pupils who studied German received the highest A-rating, and 69% of pupils who studied French and 63% of pupils who studied Spanish received the highest A-rating.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign language learning to be an essential skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as an elective subject are now considered as important as core subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that of all the reasons why employers found it difficult to fill jobs, 17% were insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
As employment opportunities in the future will be highly dependent on languages, these skills are becoming essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career path a person chooses to pursue in learning a second language, he will be far superior to others in the future if he has these life-long skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will make a person who knows several languages much more competitive.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4 000 UK adults, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to engage in a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, i.e. 15%.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Learning several languages, especially in developing countries, will give children better opportunities for meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs according to the languages taught.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be of major importance to the UK in the 2020s, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of languages to choose from in an independent school with teaching staff and specialists in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to creating an environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need for the future.
In today's global business environment, it is undeniable that languages remain vital to a country's future and this needs to be reflected in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should certainly be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and outcomes to young people in Scotland.
It must be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans are not far behind to see LeBron James kick off the season with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in the season opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But how many minutes exactly is not clear.
"It's going to be over one and under 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James' time on the roster was likely to be limited.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game regular season.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need a preseason game to prepare", he said.
A brief speech in West Virginia, on the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five speeches Trump is scheduled to give next week, including stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
By voting to approve the suspension of his choice of Supreme Court nominee, Trump is seeking to rally support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans threaten to lose control of Congress in November.
What time is the Trump speech tonight in West Virginia, and how can we watch it online?
A brief talk scheduled for 7 p.m. eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018, in Wheeling, West Virginia, will be followed by a discussion of the Bible's teachings on the subject of the Kingdom of God.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia online on the following YouTube channel.
The short will likely touch on this week's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, as she has been under a lot of strain over allegations of sexual misconduct after the Senate voted to suspend the nomination for a week while the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main goal of this campaign is to help the Republicans gain some leverage in the run-up to the November election.
So the Trump campaign says the goal of the five meetings next week, according to Reuters, is to "energize volunteers and supporters" who are working to defend and expand Republican majorities in the Senate and House.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible because it's the start of a very hot campaign season", said a Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be named.
The speech, scheduled for tonight at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling, Ohio, is expected to draw sponsors from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and will draw media attention from Pittsburgh, according to Metro News of West Virginia.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the past month, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is ranked low in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president had to come in to tip him to the top of the ratings", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA is on the warpath and hopes to qualify for Sunday's unit competition
After three individual stages on Saturday afternoon, the quarter-finals may be just what we needed in this Ryder Cup.
This kind of fluctuation is completely made up, but the players really believe it, especially in competitions like this.
So whose side is the luck now?
"They're six points ahead, and now they're four, so I guess we can call it some sort of success", Jordan Spieth said as he prepared for the day.
Of course, Europe is in the lead, with four points and 12 games to go.
The American enthusiasm, Spieth says, has faded, and they're not lacking in it, not to mention the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and each have scored three points out of four.
Spieth was unbeatable from start to finish and led the way flawlessly.
As the round progressed, the wild rumours of victory grew, and Thomas scored two points out of two to tie the game.
His shot, which won them this game on the 15th hole, was accompanied by similar slogans that seemed to say that the end of the American team was not yet.
"You just have to focus and focus on your game", Spieth said.
Now it's up to each of these players to play separately.
18 holes to the successful completion.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last few days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, undisputed Ryder Cup history.
A strange but charming couple from Europe scored four points out of four and can be calm.
Mollywoods were the only couple who didn't need extra strokes not only on Saturday afternoons, but also on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and Friday mornings.
The course of events and the warm reaction of the spectators only confirm that they will be the players who win on Sunday and that no one else will achieve the popularity of Fleetwood or Molinari, who, in the last rays of the setting sun, have a chance to secure a European victory.
It would be nice to have both in different holes at the same time.
It's too early to talk about European glory, though.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly played Sergio Garcia, the Eastern Four-Ball Champion, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A double and two double strokes in the first nine holes of the series put the Spanish and the Swedes in a bind from which they never recovered.
But Sunday is not a day of trouble.
Four-ball and four-match games are so interesting to watch because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give and don't give, and the fact that strategy can change in an instant.
Europe played better as a team, so they came out with a determined lead, but this quarter-final also showed that the US team had a fighting backbone that some, especially in the states, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will face a heavyweight lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup, with the United States leading 10-6 after Saturday's quarter-finals.
The inspiring duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinario continued to stir the atmosphere with two victories over the hard-fought Tiger Woods and a four-point lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, in an attempt to save the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years earlier, dominated the morning quarter-finals against the failing American side and finished the stage with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in the quarterfinals, winning two matches but failing to overcome the points deficit
Jim Fury's side need eight points from Sunday's 12-game series to keep the trophy in their hands.
Fleetwood are the first European rookie to win four consecutive points when they paired with Molinari at Molliwood after a sensational weekend, and they are only the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarterfinals, they flawlessly shattered the confidence that had lost Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even better score of 5-4.
Woods, who had not won two matches on Saturday, had shown a high level of professionalism at times, but had already lost 19 and 29 of his four matches, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose rested at 4am and returned to play with partner Henrik Stenson in the fours; they beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked first and third in the world.
Despite a pleasant, mildly windy day in southwest Paris, Europe was not going smoothly.
Three-time champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas lifted the American record by winning two points on Saturday.
In the four-ball match, they won a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter, and in the fourth match, they beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 3-3, without hitting a ball into the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have teams managed to overcome a four-point lead going into individual matches, although Fury's side would have had enough ties to retain the trophies.
Although they were in second place for two days, their success seemed to have waned on Sunday.
North Korea says it will never unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepen their mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would certainly not unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in recent years, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
But we didn't get a response from the US side, which he regretted.
"Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot trust our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to unilaterally disarm".
While Ri repeated the already-heard North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a phased approach to nuclear disarmament, whereby North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps, his statement stood out in that he did not completely reject the idea of bilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang had done before.
Ri recalled the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first US-North Korean summit in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim pledged to work towards the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula and Trump pledged to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US is demanding nuclear disarmament first and is increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercive methods, even by refusing to declare an end to the war", Ri said.
To think that sanctions can be used to keep us down is to dream of people we don't care about.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions are deepening our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a second Kim-Trump meeting, which the US leader had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: 'If the other party on the issue of nuclear disarmament had been South Korea rather than the US, the issue of nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have reached such a level.'
However, Ri's tone has changed dramatically since last year when he told the UN General Assembly that when President Trump called Kim a missile master who was planning a suicide mission, it was completely inevitable that North Korea would send missiles to the US.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to totally destroy North Korea, praised Kim for taking bold steps towards disarmament, but said there was still much to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea meets its nuclear disarmament requirements.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for that, and said it would take two years, three years or five months.
China and Russia have argued that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the Security Council's sanctions must be firmly maintained without any concessions until complete and final evidence-based nuclear disarmament is achieved.
The Security Council unanimously approved sanctions against North Korea as of 2006 to prevent the financing of Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with the UN General Assembly behind the scenes and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to pave the way for another meeting.
Pompeo has already made three trips to North Korea this year, but the last trip was unsuccessful.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that all the progress had been made only for North Korea to announce in a few hours that he had made gangster demands.
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle its missile base and nuclear complex if the United States takes appropriate measures.
According to him, Kim has said that the appropriate measures he sought are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and a move toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year encouraged all its students to sleep more in order to combat the growing culture of macho in the studio, caffeine and sleepless nights.
One academic found that students at the best university in the world often lack even the basic knowledge of how to care for themselves.
Charles T. Chesler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham City Women's Hospital, developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to write this course after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the talk, a girl came to me and said, "Why am I only hearing about this now, in my final year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, explains to students how the key habits of quality sleep help them achieve academic and athletic results and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's Division of Health Services, said that the university decided to offer the course when it became clear that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section is a photo of a dorm room where students can click on a coffee cup, curtains, exercise kits, and books to learn about caffeine, light, how sleep deprivation affects sports performance, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In the next section, participants learned how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons to encourage participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We understand that this will not change student behavior immediately.
But we think they have a right to know -- just as you have a right to know about the health consequences of choosing to smoke", explained Professor Czeisler.
He said that the culture of not sleeping through the night still exists, and modern technology and the growing pressure on students have led to a growing problem of sleep deprivation.
"Ensuring that students get enough and quality sleep should be a secret weapon for combating stress, exhaustion and anxiety", he said, "even avoiding weight gain, because lack of sleep switches the brain to a hunger mode, so students feel hungry all the time".
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physical biology student, helped Professor Chisler prepare a course when he attended one of his classes last year during his freshman year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to ask for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step will be to invite all second-year students to listen to the course before they start attending this competitive institution.
Professor Chesler advised students to set an alarm clock for bedtime, as well as a wake-up call, and to avoid the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic devices and LED lights, which can throw your circadian rhythm off balance and make it difficult to fall asleep.
The attack by Mengo has saddened Gerrard's men.
The Rangers suffered another disappointment when Dolly Menga Livingstone managed to beat the weakened Steven Gerrard 1-0.
Ibrox were hoping to win their first outing since their 4-1 victory in St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager and now the latter's side are eight points behind the now-defunct Premier League leaders Hearts.
Mena hit with seven minutes left in the half, but the Rangers, playing without inspiration, saw no chance of equalising the score.
Rangers have now fallen to sixth, Livingston have risen to third, and are just one goal behind Hibernian.
And that's not the end of the Rangers' concern, as it's likely that a thing smelt from the stands hit the head of the next judge, Calum Spence, injuring him.
Gerrard made four substitutions, which allowed him to overtake Ireland and take them to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, trusted the same monk who last week took a point off of Hearts, and he would trust him with how his well-thought-out combinations were putting his opponents on the line at every turn.
The Rangers dominated by controlling the ball, but with it, the Livingstones did more.
They could have hit in the second minute when Mengo passed the ball to Scott Pittman, who was trying to get in the way of Alan McGregor's goal with a close kick, but the safety ruined his chance by throwing the ball away from the goal.
After a long-range free kick by Keaghan Jacobs, the ball reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his running back Alan Lithgow requested a pass.
The Rangers took control, but the last third of the game was all about hope, not faith in their game.
Fifteen minutes later, Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty when he faced Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson in the Columbia appeals court cut his hand.
The Rangers only managed two hits in the first inning, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly alarmed by Lassana Coulibaly's head kick or the gentle delivery of Ovie Ejaria.
Although the 34th minute goal by Liverpool may not have been the right one, no one will argue that they deserved it for their efforts.
The Rangers have failed to beat the clamp Jacobs defense again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his own and passed it to Mengele for an easy finish.
During the break, Gerrard took action by trading Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and that trade paid off almost immediately when the defense played Morelos, but Kelly's impressive run slowed the play.
Livingston brought the guests into the game they liked with the long-range passing of the Lithgow and Halkett balls.
Holt's team was able to increase their overweight at the end, but McGregor defended against Jacobs' shot after Lithgow's corner kick.
Rangers player Glenn Middleton, who had come off the bench after the trade, appealed again at the end of the game for a penalty after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored him.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, today is 136 years ago and MUCH more -- on this day in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm (Hans) Geiger was born.
He developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the invention of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the device has become a hit in science and later in popular culture, with the 1950 film Bells of Coronado starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who are not exactly cowboys:
Man: What the hell is that?
This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these on, you can actually hear the atoms, the radioactive effects of the minerals.
Hey, this is really shooting!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to spot bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can train the immune system to spot bad cells and kill them
The vaccine has taught the immune system to recognize bad cells  this is part of the treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their replacement in the laboratory.
The cells can then see the proteins that are present in many cancers and inject them back.
The experimental vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various forms of cancer.
One woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells, lost her ovarian cancer for over 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from the patient and replacing them in the laboratory, then the cells can see the HER2 cancer proteins and then inject them back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "The results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and rectal cancers,  explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, where immune cells are harvested from patients and learned to target cancer cells, has been successfully applied to the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West released a Trump-supporting tirade wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on the SNL show.
It's not over, thank God.
After a relentless appearance on Saturday Night Live, fans chanted insults at Kanye West, who praised US President Donald Trump for his 2020 campaign.
After performing the third song "Ghost Town" that night, during which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he continued to denounce the Democrats and express support for Trump.
How many times have I had to talk to white people, and they say, "How can you like Trump if he's a racist?"
Well, if racism were a concern for me, I'd be out of America by now, he explained.
The SNL show began with a comedy scene in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual misconduct made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was never broadcast, footage of West's replay was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to make a move on West with this recording.
West also complained to the audience that he had been uncomfortable behind the scenes with his headgear.
They made fun of me backstage.
He said not to go in there with that hat.
They're making fun of me!
They said I hit rock bottom, and he was relieved.
West went on, "Do you want to see what's down?" he asked. "I'm wearing my Superman cap, and that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to live?"
Start making love to each other.
His remarks prompted at least two rousing cries in the audience, and SNL members appeared to be sitting down, according to Variety.
West was asked to replace singer Arian Grande as her ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West stunned many with his performance of "I Love It" in the Perrier Bottle costume.
He received support from Candace Turner, leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To the one man of the bravest spirit: THANK YOU FOR THE Pledge of Allegiance".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just being himself, and that's amazing.
But I choose NOT to be a part of a person (by buying their music or their clothes or by supporting their art) whose beliefs are a toxic ideology that is harming my community.
He's free to go.
But we're also free, she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first developer to change his name, but he followed the same path that had been taken by Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg was originally named Snoop Lion; music legend Prince's name was changed to a symbol and later became known as Prince'o.
Charges of attempted murder in a knife attack at a Belfast restaurant.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in east Belfast on Friday.
According to police, this incident took place in Balihakamore.
The accused is expected to appear before Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Star of the Wars of the Roses Keith Harington criticizes the distorted view of masculinity
Another Harington became famous as the sword-wielding character John Snow in the HBO fantasy adventure series The Wars of the Roses.
But the 31-year-old actor criticizes the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often make young boys feel that they must be cool to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought something was wrong with the man, and raised the question of how to combat the problem of perverted masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Another, who recently married 31-year-old Star Wars co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he was deeply moved by the subject.
I feel like I'm really touched by this topic right now. Where did we go wrong in developing manhood?
What are we teaching growing men to do when we face these problems?
Another suggests that television may be partly responsible for this perverted male-dominated wave, as it creates very masculine characters.
He continued: "What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television or on the street that convinces young people that they should be known for this type of manhood?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Obviously, we made a mistake with the young men somewhere.
He also confirmed in an interview that he would not be involved in any of the War of the Roses prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, and said he was tired of battlefields and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will be filming a modern-day version of Sam Shepard's True West, a film about a film director and his brother, a bandit.
The actor recently revealed the best thing that happened to him while making War of the Worlds, where he met his wife Rose.
"I met my wife on the show, and in a way, the show gave me a future family and a life", he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Iggy, the love interest of Keith's character, John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at a Leslie family-owned estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China reports an increase of 14% in the number of citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40 000 new cases were reported.
Most new infections were sexually transmitted, and this is different from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly in parts of China through transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
But over time, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has risen to 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a hot topic in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China as far back as 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, 7090% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Most cases of infection occur due to improper protection during such sexual intercourse.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as one way to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that her staff leaked the Republican senator's data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat believed the accusations were made by far-right pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and another vile lie", Waters tweeted.
The leak reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatcho, both from Utah.
The information leaked online Thursday, released by an unknown source on Capitol Hill at the same time as the Senate was hearing sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came out a little later when these three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservators' websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address used to identify the source of these records is associated with Waters' office and that the information of a member of Waters' staff has been disclosed,  reported from Capitol Hill.
"These unfounded allegations are completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations shall not be held responsible for the leakage of this information.
These unfounded allegations are completely false and utterly false.
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds evil", wrote Fleischer.
That means she doesn't have the self-respect to be a member of Congress.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
He shouldn't be defending himself.
He should not question the motives of the accuser.
He should be calm and humble.
It seems Fleischer was trying to compare Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is campaigning for a midterm to replace Waters, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"Truth, if not lies", he wrote.
In its statement, Waters stated that its office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these false allegations.
"We will make sure that the organisers are cleared", she continued, "that they are held legally accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all my employees without exception".
The comedy Johnny English is back in the spotlight with a revue of a spoofing parody of Rowan Atkinson.
It has become a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any British film. The same can be said, I think, about the revival of the action spy comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 and returned to the screen in 2011 with the comedy The Resurrection of Johnny English.
Will this sarcastic car satire about how we've obviously made it become a new national export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his wide eyes and rubber face has a second chance to bring to the surface the unpleasant truths - the very name clearly indicates that this comedy is intended for non-English speaking regions of cinema.
Of course, this stupid secret agent, who, while claiming to be a luxury, has also acquired a little bit of Inspector Clouseau's qualities, a little bit of Mr. Byne's traits, and a hint of the guy who was used to create the theme of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony's drama Chariots of Fire.
It is also loosely based on the character of the traveller and the mysterious man who caused the chaos, which Atkinson once played in a now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial.
There are some beautiful moments in this latest film by Johnny English.
I loved it when Johnny English approached the helicopter, wearing a medieval suit and armor, and the rotor of the knight hit his helmet.
Atkinson's comedic talent is obvious, but the humor itself seems inflated and oddly excessive, especially when serious movie brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible boldly insert comedy elements.
The humor is more for children than for adults, and I find the adventures of the incredible Johnny English not as inventive and as tactful as Atkinson's silent jokes about Mr. Bean.
The current theme is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has successfully hacked into Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British spies in the area, causing the agent to become outraged  overly insignificant role of Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw to the prime minister's cup, a pompous and cornered character who is already suffering from a crushing political unpopularity: Emma Thompson, the character portrayed by Theresa May, is squeezing everything she can, but the script is not good enough for that.
Her wise counsel informs her that all her agents have been identified and that she will have to look for people who have retired.
That means you're going to have to go to John English himself, who's currently working as a school principal in some fancy office, but is giving illegal classes on how to be a secret agent.
English is sent back to Whitehall to discuss an emergency and there he meets his longtime partner Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, connected to the submarine commander, and Vicki Pepperdine, playing the high society girl, seems underutilized.
So Batman and Robin, able to handle all the affairs of Her Majesty's secret service, take action again and meet the fateful beauty Ofelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
The Prime Minister is being dangerously beaten by a charismatic billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problem, namely the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant, cause chaos on the luxury yacht of the Volta, and English begins total anarchy, attempting to use virtual reality headphones to explore the interior of the Volta house.
All the stop-motion footage was clearly kept from this last series, but as nice and wild as it is, it all reminds me a lot of children's television.
It's pretty mediocre.
As with all of John English's films, I couldn't help but think: Is it the British film industry's fault that they couldn't give Rowan Atkinson a role that was truly worthy of his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning to consider a radical plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but be paid five days' pay.
The party reportedly wants company executives to share the savings accumulated from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving their employees one day off.
This would allow workers to enjoy three days off and take home the same amount of pay.
The source says that this idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to move the country's development in a worker-friendly direction.
The move to a four-day week was also welcomed by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
This will not happen overnight, but the four-day workweek is in line with the Party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers, as well as the Party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first to promote the idea; the Green Party also promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this is not the view of the whole Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day week is not party policy and is not being considered in the party".
The Shadow Government spokesman John McDonnell took the opportunity to present his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy at last week's Labour Party conference.
Mr McDonnellis has said he is determined to take back power from the faceless dictators and the bounty hunters in the utilities.
Such shadow chancellor plans also mean that the current water company shareholders may not recover their full stake, as the Labour government may see some of the damage done and take some of it back.
It also approved plans to include employees on the company's board and to create participatory equity funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector companies to employees, who could receive up to GBP 500 in annual dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy answering 60 Minutes' question about whether the FBI investigation into Mr Kavanaugh might change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on whether to appoint him to the Supreme Court by at least a week, so the question is whether the facts the Bureau of Investigation has uncovered could influence any Republican senators' opinion so that they don't take this judge at his word.
In an interview airing Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asks Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if it's possible that the FBI will find something that will change their minds.
Senator Kennedy seems to be more liberal than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course", Kennedy answered.
As I said, on my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge B. Kavanaugh.
When this happened, when these allegations came out, I called him and asked, "Did you do this?"
He answered firmly, firmly, unequivocally.
So it seems that nothing could change L. Graham's opinion.
"If I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, there should be some pretty shocking charges", he says.
"I don't know what was going on with Dr. Ford, but I do know one thing: Brett flatly denies it", added L. Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
No one she's named can confirm that.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything new will come out.
What is the World Citizens' Festival and has it contributed to poverty reduction in any way?
This Saturday in New York, the World Citizens' Festival  is an annual music event featuring an impressive number of stars, and which aims to achieve the equally impressive goal  of ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizens' Festival will gather tens of thousands of people at the Great Grass in Central Park, not only to hear the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to spread the word about the event's real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project , an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless they wanted a paid VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a variety of tasks or actions, such as volunteering, emailing the world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully helping to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But are the world's citizens succeeding in reaching this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really going to convince them to demand and call for action? Is this just another example of what's called cliqueism, fictitious activism, where people think they'll really make a difference by signing an online petition or posting a post on Twitter.
According to the organisers of the World Citizens' Festival, the movement has registered more than 19 million actions since 2011, which have promoted a wide range of goals.
They say that, under pressure from these actions, world leaders have announced $37 billion in commitments and policy strategies that will change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group indicated 390 commitments and declarations driven by the group's actions, of which at least US$10 billion had already been paid or raised.
The group estimates that the funds have already directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investor-operator partnership to help children grow and reach their full potential.With more than 4,700 Twitter followers from around the world, she pledged US$1 million to help Rwanda tackle malnutrition.
"With the support of the UK government, our sponsors, our national governments and people like you, the citizens of the world, we can make social injustice like malnutrition a thing of the past", said Tracey Ullman, the Food Power Ambassador, at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after receiving 5 000 petitions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for the Nutrition Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the DUK's questions on their website, which asks, "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
The world's citizens say, "It's a long and difficult road, "and sometimes we stumble and fail.
But like the great movements for human rights and against apartheid, we will win because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the performers at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
According to the Home Secretary, the US could use the blockade of the Russian Navy to impede Russian energy exports.
"Washington could use the navy to block Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East", said U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially when it acts at the invitation of legitimate authorities, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think Russia is interfering in the Middle East because it wants to regulate the energy sector, as it does in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe", Zinke said, according to the information available.
According to the official, there are ways and means to resolve this issue.
"The United States can do that with its navy, it can keep the sea lanes open and, if necessary, it can blockade, make sure that their energy doesn't reach the market", he said.
Zinke said this to an event organised by the Consumers' Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the Voice of the Energy Consumers in the US.
He then compared Washington's methods with those used to deal with Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
"The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is to find a more or less competitive alternative to fuel", he said, referring to Russia as a country whose entire economy depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came as the Trump administration pursues its mission to increase its LNG exports to Europe and replace Russia on the market, offering European consumers a much cheaper option.
Therefore, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the ill-fated Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion-euro Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic metres, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is purely economic, as it is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we all agree that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the choice of supplier", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was met with a hostile reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its determination to continue the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral Berlin and Moscow agreements.
"I really disagree with the interference of a third country in our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering running for president in 2020.
On Saturday, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the Holyoke Senate, E. Warren of Massachusetts confirmed that he was considering running.
"When women go to Washington to handle our failed administration, they have to go to the highest office", she told the House.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider whether to run in the presidential election.
At a town hall meeting, Warren taunted President Donald Trump, saying he was leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am very frightened by the way Donald Trump is treating our democracy", she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of Trump and his proposed Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet posted on Friday, Warren said that the vote was a clear call for an FBI investigation.
But a poll released Thursday shows that a majority of Warren's own state voters think she shouldn't run for president in 2020.
A poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe shows that 58 percent of likely Massachusetts voters say the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her candidacy.
The poll showed the most support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposing.
Other candidates discussed for the 2020 Democratic nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden says he will make an official decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin speaks at the rally of Donald Trump about Tracko Palin's traumatic disorder
Track Palin, 26, enlisted in the Army in September and spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged after a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
"I see what my son is going through, what he's going through in his return to life, so I understand other families who are feeling the effects of trauma, and some of the injuries our soldiers are coming home with", she told the crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline called his arrest an inevitable truth, saying that her son and other veterans are coming back a little bit different, they're coming back with a stronger heart, they're coming back with doubts about whether they're going to be respected for what their fellow soldiers and their peers and all the other soldiers have done for their country.
He was arrested Monday in Vasilla, Alaska, charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as charges of obstructing the reporting of domestic violence with a gun and disorderly conduct, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Vasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support opposition to the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenges to the new U.S. policy of refusing to provide asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed amicus curiae briefs in Washington on Friday to support the challenge to asylum-seeking policies, reports NBC News.
The full names of the plaintiffs in the Grace v. Sessions trial, which the American Civil Liberties Union initiated against federal policy, are not disclosed.
She says her partner and members of his criminal gang used violence against her, but on July 20, U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which receive high levels of asylum requests from the United States, as countries plagued by persistent gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said the new policy "does not violate decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal legislation requires decisions on asylum applications to be taken in the light of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition infringes this principle,  says the amicus curiae note.
In this note, the lawyers also argue that the policy of banning immigrants from entering the country harms the US economy and makes immigrants more likely to engage in business and provide the necessary employment services.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June directed immigration judges to stop seeking asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Help is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or a fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", said Mr Sessions in a policy statement on 11 June.
The asylum system has never been designed to solve all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims has doubled in Pallu, and the search for survivors is desperate.
The situation of the survivors is getting worse.
"The tension is very high", says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she calms her feverish baby son at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
The Rapids are carrying more and more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
It has been observed that residents return to their destroyed homes, collect flooded items, and try to rescue whatever they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were devastated by the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Hari, who suffered broken backs and shoulders, are being treated outside the Palu Military Hospital.
Tears flow into his eyes as he describes how he felt a powerful earthquake in the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to save the others.
I think I got through the wall collapse, " Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to town for the wedding.
I heard my wife's cry for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and her daughter.
I hope she's all right.
US Ambassador accuses China of intimidating with propaganda
A week after the Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement in the US newspaper denying mutual benefit to US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday cited the China Daily's paid-for op-ed page for the Des Moines Register, Iowa's most-bought newspaper, and accused China of trying to influence the US congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to influence the US election marks a new phase in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to promote trade through advertising, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war, and both countries are fighting tariffs on each other's imports.
According to Chinese and US experts, the Chinese countervailing duties were directed at exporters in Iowa and similar states that supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Branstad  US Ambassador to China, former longtime governor of Iowa and one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China  said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion piece published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad said China was becoming more and more arrogant by printing propaganda ads in our free press.
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government took advantage of the freedom of speech and the press respected in America and commissioned a paid publicity story", wrote Branstad in the Des Moines Register.
"Meanwhile, you won't find conflicting voices in the local Beijing press booth and you won't get a real picture of the different opinions that Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic trajectory because the press is under the heavy weight of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
Branstad also added that some of the major Chinese newspapers had refused to publish his article, but did not mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn: As the midterm elections approach, the Kavanaugh fiasco was deterred by a Republican voter
While many Republican leaders remain loyal to Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of several sexual harassment charges, an analyst warned that this would draw a negative response in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The situation is very emotional, and many Republicans have already formally declared their intention to vote.
"You can't take that back", said Grant Reeher, a professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Mr. Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute calls by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will remember it tomorrow and in November", according to the Washington Post, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group, "MoveOn", Karine Jean-Pierre, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted: "November is coming!" in the Senate lobby as Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, kzip reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will spread across countries", Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
People say she was strong enough, and they're right.
But it could further strengthen the position, especially among undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, who, although they dislike the president, often simply do not vote.
Even before Ch.B. Ford gave public testimony, when she detailed the sexual harassment allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said that if the Republicans endorsed the nomination, it could cause outrage.
"This has caused a lot of confusion for the Republican Party", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote, not just whether Kavanaugh will be appointed as a judge, but how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled Ch.B. Ford", Guy Cecil, director of the U.S. Priorities group, told the news channel.
Yet, Americans still seem to disagree on what to believe after the testimony of Kavanaugh and Ford, although it is gaining some more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe fully or almost completely in Ford's shows, and 35 percent say they believe fully or almost completely in Kavanaugh.
Furthermore, 38 percent said they thought that Mr. Kavanaugh had actually or probably lied in giving testimony, and only 30 percent felt the same about Mr. Ford.
Under the direction of Ms. Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ms. Ford and the testimony of at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ch.B. Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, claiming that Kavanaugh, while a marine, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ms. Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party they attended while studying at Yale University in the ninth grade.
The inventor of the media is planning to create a new internet to rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is creating a new startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary inventor is Inrupt, a company that works on the Berners-Lee open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to take over the world.
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
This is a historic moment.
Solid technology-based app allows people to create their own personal online data store  POD.
It may include lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal or work tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all running on the same browser at the same time.
The online store of personal data is unique in that it is the user who decides who can access which information.
The company calls this personal empowerment through data.
According to CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of T. Berners-Lee, J. Bruce Lee, the security platform purchased by IBM, a few programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team disagreed with Facebook or Google about changes that would overnight upend all business models.
We don't ask their permission.
In a Medium report published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the sustainability and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Consortium of Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even while working with Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the Knowledge Consortium, the Knowledge Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I feel very optimistic about this new era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
The Honorable Bernard Vann  Victorian War I Clergyman
The only Anglican clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery in the First World War is honoured in his home town on the centenary.
Colonel Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the medal during the attack on Belengiz and Lucre on 29 September 1918.
Unfortunately, four days later, Pastor was shot by a sniper, so he was left unaware that he had been awarded the highest British military decoration.
A memorial stone was unveiled by two grandchildren at the parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the stone's unveiling exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning work is "very symbolic".
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel John H. Gordon led his battalion across the St Kent Channel in a highly explosive smoke, with heavy gun and machine gun fire.
He then rushed to the line of fire and, with extraordinary gallantry, led the line forward, then single-handedly attacked the battalion and killed three of the battalion's fighters.
Lieutenant Colonel B. Vann was shot by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something that he will never be able to match", but at the same time, humility was a very inspiring thing.
After the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, Michael and his brother Dr. James Vann laid the wreath.
Michael Vann said he was honoured to be in the parade, adding: "The courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people will give".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and were satisfied with the "Kiaulyte Pepa"
Imagine, you stay up all night to see the Bellator 206 and you don't get to see the main show.
The San Jose poster featured 13 fights, six of which were on the main card and broadcast live in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the fight, the UK audience was stunned by the interrupted film "Piggy Pepa".
Some spectators were not impressed, to say the least, because it was the fight that kept them awake until dawn.
One of the fans on Twitter called the change to the show's children's animated film "a kind of silly joke".
Due to the rules set by the authorities, such content was inappropriate at 6am and therefore a children's programme had to be turned on,  When asked about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Senior Vice President Marketing and Communications at Bellator replied.
Yes, the Piggy Pep.
Scott Coker, President of Bellator, stated that in the future, efforts will be made to adjust the schedules to take account of the UK audience.
"When I think about the replay, I think maybe we could do it", Coker said.
But then it's 6:00 a.m. on Sunday, and we wouldn't be able to solve it by Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on that.
Believe me, after the change of channel, there was a lot of texting, not all of which was friendly.
We tried to fix it, but we thought it was a technical error.
But it's not about power.
I can promise you that it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do.
This is a bad situation.
Tom Daley felt insecure about his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Thomas Daley says that he grew up feeling inferior because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him motivation to pursue success.
24 athletes only said it in elementary school when they realized they weren't like everyone else.
He first appeared on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, and said he had started speaking out about gay rights because he wanted to give others hope.
He also said that being a father was not so important as winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular on this long-running program, has been out of work for several months because of illness.
In the first Laverne show, where guests were asked to imagine traveling to a deserted island, Mr. Daley claimed that growing up he felt inferior to everyone else because it was socially unacceptable to like both boys and girls.
He said, "Even today, that sense of inferiority and of being different has been the driving force that has helped me achieve success".
He said he wanted to prove himself so that he would not disappoint those around him when they finally learned of his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT activist and, at this year's Commonwealth Games, took the opportunity to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he began to speak about it publicly because he felt that he was lucky to be able to live an honest life without consequences and wanted to give others that same hope.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with the man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - was unexpected.
Mr. Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior last year, but he claims the age difference has never been a problem.
According to T. Delay, when you go through so much at such a young age - he competed in his first Olympics at just 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - it's hard to meet someone who's the same age but has experienced the same highs and lows.
In June, when the couple became the parents of a son, Robert Ray Blacko-Daley, Daley said his perspective changed completely.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said that winning the gold medal was the most important thing to me", he said.
But, you know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
Robby is my Olympic gold medal.
The son's name is the same as that of his grandfather, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
To Ant T. Daley, his father refused to accept death, so one of his last questions was whether he had already bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics, which he was going to watch from the front row.
"I couldn't tell him he wouldn't live long enough to sit in the front row", said Mr. Daley.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally admit that he was not invulnerable", said Mr. Daley.
A year later, he competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was something I'd dreamed of all my life to jump in the water and watch the local crowd at the Olympics, and it was the best feeling", he said.
It also inspired the first song selection for the show, "Proud" by Heather Small, which reflected his feelings about the Olympics and still pleasantly rubs his skin.

After losing his form, Ph. Mickelson spent Saturday's Ryder Cup on the sidelines.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for the 47th Ryder Cup on Sunday, but he will need to improve his form to avoid a rocky start.
Ph. Mickelson, playing in his 12th bi-annual tournament, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's quarterfinals.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as was often the case in the United States, the five-time overall winner spent part of the day on the support team and spent the rest of the day improving his technique on the field in an effort to correct game-impeding errors.
Even if they don't play very straight at the height of their careers, the 48-man is not an ideal player on the rugged courts of the Le Gold National, where long stretches of rough grass are particularly unfavorable for misses.
And as if the field itself isn't scary enough, in Game 9 on Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will play the highly-rated British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has won all four matches this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the four-point-delayed Americans manage to get off to a good start in the upcoming 12-point match, then Ph. Mickelson's match could be the decisive one.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, but he probably couldn't say otherwise.
"He understood perfectly his role today, and he slapped me on the back and hugged me and said he was ready to play tomorrow", said Furyk.
He's not lacking in confidence.
He's on the list of the greatest athletes of all time and has given a lot to these teams both in the past and this week.
Maybe I didn't think he'd play two matches.
I had more in mind, but it turned out that way, so we decided to do it.
He wants to play, like everybody else.
On Sunday, Ph. Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, and not even the height of his personal best.
Mickelson has a record of 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk claims that his presence has also brought immaterial benefits to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make people laugh, and he's a great guy to be in the team room with", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun with him this week, too, it was good to watch.
He brings a lot more than a game.
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great deal of persuasion can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows from experience that a big upset can easily turn into a tough fight as the final Ryder Cup unit competition approaches.
The Danish athlete made his debut in 1997 at the match at Valderamo, where the opposing team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line only narrowly ahead with a score of 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"We're reminded that we had a big win at Valderamo, we had a big win at Brooklyn where we lost, and we had a big win at Valderamo where we won, but only by a small margin", said Bjorn (pictured), watching the 2018 show win 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Le National Golf Course.
So the story will show me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
Tomorrow, we're gonna need all the strength we can get.
Go and do it right.
As long as there are no points on the board, the game is over.
We have a goal to try and win this prize, so we have to be consistent.
I always say, I trust the 12 players who are on our side, but we know very well who is on the other side.
Satisfied with the performance of his players on the difficult pitch, Bjorn added: 'I would not want to be in the way of my own performance.
Tomorrow will be a different hair day.
Tomorrow, the main event will be an individual game.
It's great to play with a partner when things are going well, but when you're on the court alone, your golfing skills are tested.
That's the idea we need to instill in the players. Tomorrow, they're gonna have to push themselves.
Now you're gonna have to break up with your partner, and he's gonna have to get it out of his system.
Unlike T. Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who each scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced both sides of the final day's surprises, as he was on the winning team in Brooklyn before Europe abandoned the Miracle of Medina and made them the losers.
"I remember every damn word", he said, when asked how 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw motivated his players as they headed to their final day.
We have 12 big games tomorrow, but aim for a quick start like you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When acceleration occurs in one direction, the middle blades become very tense.
So we've sort of put together our team and released the players in a way that we're, you know... trying to create some magic tomorrow.
Thomas will be tasked with trying to lead a counter-attack and meet Rory McIlroy in the top tier match, with Europeans led by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"I picked these guys in that exact order because I think they're going to win the whole game".
Delivery of new German warship postponed again
The newest German Navy frigate was due to enter service in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era warships, but according to local media, due to the increasingly sophisticated systems and the high cost of the new vessels, we will not see them until at least next year.
According to the military spokesman quoted by the newspaper Die Zeit, the commissioning of the lead ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigates  Rhineland-Palatinate  is now postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the fate of this ambitious project was clouded by the problems already plaguing the ship.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class vessels, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is expected to be equipped with a powerful airbase, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some secrecy technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic tracking.
Another important feature is  longer maintenance intervals, which could allow the latest frigates to sail away from home ports for up to two years.
However, according to Die Zeit, the continuing delays will cause the most technologically advanced warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to direct military power to overseas territories, to become obsolete before they can be deployed.
The failed F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to take the vessel over and returned it to the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss shipyard.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a builder that has already been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German press mentions several major software and hardware defects that would have made the ship unsuitable for a military mission.
The software shortcomings are particularly significant, as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 seamen, half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too heavy  this reduces its efficiency and limits the ability of the Navy to implement various improvements in the future.
The 7 000 tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
The cost of the whole project  alongside the supporting technical equipment including crew training  is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have risen from an initial amount of EUR 2,2 billion to a staggering EUR 3,1 billion (US$ 3,6 billion).
The latest frigate distress has become particularly significant following recent warnings that the German navy is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the navy was indeed running out of ships fit for service.
The official said that problems had arisen over time because the old ships had been written off but had not been replaced.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the fleet.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats.
A new study in a Scottish highland manor is trying to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The findings are expected to provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals and provide some guidance for future conservation activities.
Researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will observe bats, sopranos, brown eels and sea mussels in the gardens of Inververve, West Rode.
Special recorders will be installed in certain areas of the territory to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
The National Health Service staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile tests with handheld detectors.
The analysis of all the sound recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the signals emitted by the bats and the activity of one or another species.
A map of the habitats and a report will then be produced, helping to form a detailed behavioural picture of the whole landscape.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser at the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management, such as grassland development, and to identify the best ways to manage forested areas to make them suitable for bats and other related species.
Over the past century, bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined.
They are threatened by construction and real estate development projects that affect the slopes and destroy residential areas.
Wind power and lightning, as well as mosquitoes, some chemicals used in building materials, and domestic cats that hunt are also threats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, the ears are more useful than the eyes in catching prey at night.
Bates shall accurately locate insects or obstacles in their flight path by means of sophisticated echolocation.
The NTS, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes a very responsible view of bats.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, check-ups of the reefs and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only bat sanctuary in Scotland, at Threave House in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The court's warden, David Thompson, says the courtyard is ideal for them.
"We have a great place for bats at Threave", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and great living space.
But we still don't know much about bats, so working here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to thrive.
He stresses that it is essential to check for bats before starting the site, since accidental destruction of one nest may kill up to 400 females and young, leading to the destruction of the entire local population.
Bates shall be protected and shall not be killed, harassed or disturbed, nor shall their nest be destroyed.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official with the Scottish Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to help save bats.
She said: 'We have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't know what's going on with many of the native species.'
Ronaldo denies rape charges  Lawyers plan to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "meagre" and said people are trying to make a name for themselves by using his name.
His lawyers are ready to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorg in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to cover up the incident.
Speaking to 142 million followers on Instagram hours after the allegations were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo criticized the reports and called them "melancholy".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do this.
What they're saying today is a lie, spoken five times by a Ballon d'Or winner looking into the camera.
They want to use my name to make a name for themselves.
That's the way it is.
They want to be famous, say my name. It's part of my job.
"I'm a happy man, everything is fine", the athlete added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take Der Spiegel to court on charges they have called "unacceptable" of allegedly publicizing things happening in private space.
Justice Christian Schertz argued that the athlete would seek compensation for moral damage, an amount commensurate with the seriousness of this violation, arguably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the individual in recent years.
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 at the Palm Beach Casino and Hotel Apartments in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in the Clark County Courthouse in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the athlete's room, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a 99 percent good man who was betrayed by the remaining 1 percent of his personality.
The documents state that Ronaldo admitted that the couple had had sexual relations, but claimed that they were contractual.
Ms Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that her injuries were photographed in hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she feared retaliation and feared public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to cancel the agreement because she continues to feel traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was a free agent from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer, he signed a €100 million contract to join Italian giants Juventus.
The UK would regret forever the loss of its car manufacturers
According to Business Secretary Greg Clark, the UK would be forever regretted if it lost its status as a global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He added that he was concerned about the statement made by Toyota's UK unit to the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be suspended.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer argued that a loss of jobs would result from a 'no-deal' Brexit.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if Britain suddenly leaves the European Union at the end of March, we'll have to stop production at our factory", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota's Burnastone.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover, also expressed concern about the no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on international trade.
For example, BMW claims that it will close its Mini factory one month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the most worrying threat to the supply chain is a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is operational when needed, as parts for custom cars are delivered from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU every 37 minutes.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a treaty on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays or a lack of details, according to the industry.
Toyota claimed that the Derbyshire plant could not hold more than the daily stock and therefore production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's "Chequers" plan for future relations with the EU is "designed precisely to avoid such checks at the border".
"We want to have the best deal, which I would say is not only to enjoy the success today, but to take advantage of the opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Not only Toyota's data, but also those of other car manufacturers show that the continued use of the highly successful supply chain system is essential.
The Commission also noted that the company's sales volume was not significantly higher than the sales volume of the Union industry.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is responsible for the 'Unite' trade union meetings, said that his union members are increasingly worried: 'I can tell you from experience that once these jobs are lost, they will never come back.'
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed a clear and credible plan for future relations with the EU".
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again.
With the battle for the Supreme Court nominee still raging, Donald Trump's crucial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed for another week, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, Trump aides' ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy attorney general, thus threatening Mueller's independence, has been rumored for months in Washington.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of using the 25th Amendment to impeach the president.
Rosenstein denied this report.
However, amidst the news of his resignation, he went to the White House last Monday.
Instead, it was announced that the meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, would take place on Thursday.
Trump said he would not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was later postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that included Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate Kavanaugh's allegations within a week, again postponing a vote in the Senate plenary.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Channel on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date is not set. It could happen this week, but given all the events related to the Supreme Court, it could be postponed for another week".
I always like to report to the press.
Some journalists would disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that press conferences are rare, not because he hates TV journalists who are trying to get a big audience, but because he has to accept the fact that they are trying to get a big audience.
Then they mentioned that Trump was more likely to speak to the press directly.
"The president answers questions more often than any previous president", she said, adding, without providing any evidence, "We've looked at these statistics".
Sanders says that press conferences will be held, but since the press has the opportunity to ask questions of the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do this many times, and you've seen it happen many times over the last few weeks, and press conferences will replace your direct interaction with the president of the United States.
The Trump is a regular on the way out of the White House, attending public meetings or press conferences with distinguished guests.
One-person press conferences are rare.
The president's free and sometimes bizarre appearance to the press this week in New York probably explains why.
The Health Minister wrote to NTS staff from the EU about the Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the NTS staff from the EU expressing the country's gratitude and wishes that they remain after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in the public service sector entrusted to it.
In his letter, Mr Freeman wrote: "The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued in the summer and are nearing the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also been more aggressive in preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all very worried right now.
That's why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all employees, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the healthcare system, benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we would very much like you to stay.
Emergency surgery for head injury to Christion Abercrombie
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery on Saturday at 31:27 p.m. after suffering a head injury that caused the Vanderbilt Commodores to lose the game, Tennesseean reporter Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
He came to the sideline and just crouched there, Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics at the sideline gave Abercrombie oxygen, then put her on a stretcher and sent her for further testing.
Tennessee State Police Officer Chris Harris of the Nashville, Tennessee WSMV said that Abercrombie's surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center has been completed.
Harris added that there is no information yet on the type and extent of the injury, and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when it occurred.
Officially a postseason starter, Abercrombie is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
Before leaving the game, he recovered five balls on Saturday, bringing his total of 18 balls recovered for the season.
Foreign buyers of UK property will have to pay a higher landmark tax
Under the new Tory plans, foreign buyers of UK property will have to pay a higher mark-up tax and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This step will mitigate the risk posed by Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters
The increased mark-up tax will be charged to UK non-taxable persons
The Treasury hopes to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers of UK property will be charged a higher rate of land tax and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
By promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners, it is believed that this move will mitigate the risks posed by Jeremy Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters.
The increased mark-up tax will be charged to UK tax-exempt individuals and businesses, and the additional money will be used to support the Government's campaign to tackle homelessness.
The additional charge  is paid in addition to the current mark-up charge, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes or rental homes  can reach up to three per cent.
The Treasury hopes this will raise up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to do so.
Many foreign buyers spend most of their time out of the country, and many of the country's affluent areas, especially the capital, have become ghost towns.
The new strategy was introduced just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the land tax to help more young people buy their first homes.
He accused big construction companies of supporting high property prices by buying land quickly but not using it, and urged May to tackle the UK housing scandal by abandoning affordable housing quotas.
Corbyn has announced several eye-catching proposed housing reforms, including a rental price control and a ban on evictions without fault.
He also wants more power to build new houses for the municipal councils.
May said: "I said last year that as Prime Minister I would try to bring back the British dream, that life must be better for every new generation.
And that means we need to fix our broken housing market.
Great Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that non-UK residents and companies established abroad can buy a home as easily as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of housing has become almost impossible, and the threat of homelessness remains all too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to lead the Scotland national team".
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate goal is to one day become Scotland's head coach.
The 42-year-old Scottishman likes the challenge of reviving North-East, who are currently in third place in the Premier League and three points behind the top-ranked club.
Having led St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship last season, he has moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the B team and that was the end of it, Ross told Scotland's Sportssound on BBC.
But growing up, I was at Hamden Stadium with my dad, watching a lot of Scotland's games, and it always made me come back.
True, this opportunity will only come if I lead the club successfully.
Sunderland was led by Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paul DiCanio.
Having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, the former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about working under such renowned managers at such a big club.
"Now my success will be judged by the answer to the question 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
"The club is definitely in the Premier League, in terms of structure and conditions", he said.
It's not an easy task to get him there, but I guess I'll only consider it a success if I get the club back in the league.
Ross's managerial career lasted only three years, before he worked as assistant manager at Dumbarton and was the Hearts' substitute coach for 15 months.
He later helped re-establish the relegation of All Blacks to the Third Division, and helped St Mirren, which was in danger of relegation, win the league the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied than he has ever been in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
This change must have been radical, remembers leadership.
I sincerely believed that I was better suited to lead than to play.
That sounds strange, since I was successful, earned a lot of money, and enjoyed satisfying success.
But playing can be difficult.
You have a lot of problems to deal with every week.
And it's not easy right now with the stress and the tension of the job, but I feel like leadership is exactly what I need.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it now, and as an adult, I've always felt like I was in my own corner, but leadership is the most rewarding.
The full interview can be heard on the SportsSound programme on Sunday 30 September at 12 noon to 1pm UK time.
Studies have shown that the best time to drink beer is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has boosted the income of Britain's impoverished brewers, but it has made the burden on restaurant chains even more difficult.
The figures revealed that sales of beer and bar groups rose by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, the business consultancy CGA, who produced the data, said: "The endless sunshine and longer than expected England's participation in the World Cup meant that the trend in July was similar to that in June, when beer revenues rose by 2.8%.
In June, restaurant sales fell by 1.8 percent, and in July the situation worsened.
The main income from the beverage trade was undoubtedly the best achieved by the beer and bar sectors, which increased more than the decline in restaurants.
Although not as strongly as restaurant firms, the sun has also affected the beer industry, which is a major source of food revenue.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of beverages in well-managed pubs and bars rose by 6.6% this month, while food sales fell by 3%.
According to Paul Newman, of leisure and leisure sector analyst RSM, these results continue the trend seen since the end of April.
As regards catering establishments, the main factors remain the effects of weather and major social and sporting events.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a drop in sales of 4.8% in the past year will be particularly painful, as it will contribute to the ongoing cost pressure.
For the businesses that generate the most income from the food trade, a long hot summer could not have come at a worse time.Time will tell whether the milder temperatures in August will provide much needed respite.
The overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July and reflected a slowdown in the expansion of branded networks.
The UK's beer, bar and restaurant sector, which is recognised as a guide, uses the 'The Coffer Peach Tracker' sales tracking tool to collect and analyse activity data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children has a social media account that is hidden from their parents
The study found that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has reinforced fears of sexually explicit content
Twenty percent of the students said they had to show their parents the main account
One in five children - some as young as 11 - set up secret social media accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake Instagram pages, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has reinforced fears of sexually explicit content
Twenty percent of the students said they use a censored main account designed to show parents, but they also have secret accounts.
One mother, after accidentally discovering the secret Web site of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that the teenager was insistently offering: "Rape me!"
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Principals' Conference (ISC) found that 40 per cent of pupils aged 11-18 had two accounts, with half of those pupils admitting that their accounts were hidden.
The head of the ICRC, Mike Buchanan, said: 'It is worrying that so many teenagers are giving in to the temptation to create virtual spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.'
Eilidha Doyle will be the voice of the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidha Doyle has been elected as a Director-Counsellor at the annual meeting of the Scottish Sports Council's governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman, Ian Beattie, described the move as a great opportunity for people in charge of the sport to tap into the vast amount of international experience she has gained over the past decade.
"Eilidha has earned a great deal of respect throughout Scotland, the UK and the world's sporting community and we have no doubt that her inclusion on the Scottish Sports Council will be of great benefit", said Beattie.
Doyle said, "I really want to serve as the voice of the sport and I hope to really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland".
The American 200- and 400-meter medallist at the 1996 Atlanta Games and four-time Olympic gold medalist, now a regular on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a brief bout of eczema.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke last month.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It took some work to get dry, but I made a full recovery, learned to walk again, and today I am doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
An online advert for breast milk comparing mothers to cows has received mixed reviews
A company that produces breast milk has received mixed reactions to its advertising comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of what has been described as the world's first silent breast lift, consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ad inspired by an ironic music video, which aims to showcase the freedom that a new breast pump gives to nursing mothers.
In the haystack, four real mothers dance to a recording that says, for example, "Yes, I'm lying to myself, but I can't see any tail" and "If you haven't noticed, this is not my vagina, this is my breast".
The appendix goes on to say, "Take it out, take it out, I feed it to babies, take it out, take it out, kiss my beauties".
However, the advertisement on the company's Facebook page has caused an online controversy.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received several hundred comments, has received mixed reactions, with many saying that it shows the horrors of the dairy industry through the fingers.
Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad solution.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only to have their newborn taken away from them a few days later, wrote one woman.

Another commented: "It's understandable that it traumatizes both the mother and the newborn.
But why not use them to promote a breast milk package for mothers whose babies are not being taken away?
Someone else added: "The ad is a complete misunderstanding".
Another commentator defended the ad, saying that one woman found the song amusing.
I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I still had food.
I felt like a cow when I cut the milk.
The commercials are a little crazy, but I've accepted it for what it is.
This product is a genius, written by one.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial for mothers who are sucking their milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
It is not intended to drink or condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they are all dancing with invisible petticoats in their vests.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who stop breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk bottle does not make any sound, has no wires or tubes and has a discreet space in the feeding case so that women can move freely, hold their babies or even leave the house when they are weaned.
Mother partner and Executive Creative Director Ana Balarin commented: Elvie is a revolutionary product, worthy of a bold and provocative launch.
By comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the challenge of breastfeeding and all the challenges that come with it, while also making it as fun and as free as possible to experience the incredible feeling of a new milkshake.
This is not the first time that Elvis's photograph has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Martha Jakubowski demonstrated her collection on the podium with this product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp near the Texas border
The number of people crossing the border has remained largely unchanged over the month, but the number of migrant children detained has increased significantly  in part because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it harder to accommodate them with caregivers.
Traditionally, most of the guardians were undocumented immigrants themselves and feared that by applying for custody they would risk their ability to remain in the country.
The risk was further increased in June when the federal government announced that prospective carers and other adult family members would have to provide fingerprints and that these would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Immigration and Customs Enforcement's chief of staff, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested several dozen people who had applied for the custody of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
Almost 80 percent of these individuals  their guardians or family members  are in the country illegally, and most of them are foreign criminals.
"We will continue to pursue these people", Albence said.
To speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules that require some children to appear in court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days, according to the shelter's staff.
Many will try to defend their application for legal status against an immigration judge not by coming in person, but by using a video conference call.
Those who are declared ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are held, the more likely they are to become restless or depressed, which can encourage forced breaking and attempted escape.
Advocates say that the bigger the shelter, the bigger the shelter, the more likely it is to miss signs of distress.
They added that moving children to a tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends may aggravate the trauma many have already experienced.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In addition, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the eight-year-old war in the country.
Moualem, also acting as Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces operating under the pretext of fighting terrorism on Syrian soil are illegal and will be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the war on terrorism in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been displaced since 2011, is almost over.
He said that Damascus will not stop fighting this holy fight until we eliminate both terrorist groups and any illegal aliens in all Syrian territories.
There are approximately 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are resisting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Speaking on the refugee problem, Moualem said that conditions for their return were good, while accusing some Western countries of spreading unfounded fear that discourages refugees from returning.
"We have turned to the international community and humanitarian organisations to help them return", he said.
They politicize what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will only receive reconstruction aid once Assad and the opposition reach a political agreement and end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has opened the way for faster progress in political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement avoided a large-scale Russian-backed Syrian offensive targeting a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement included clear deadlines and expressed the hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is linked to Al-Qaeda, and would be destroyed.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the government-opposition committee soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions under which the work of the  Group should be limited to the revision of the articles of the current constitution, and warned against interference by the Syrian Government.
Why is Trump going to run for a second term?
By that logic, Trump would have been elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers would expect, his presidency ended prematurely with a scandal and a scandal.
Without a doubt, that would be the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
So far, no signs of tiredness.
Since 2014, the top-rated time on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show tops cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time news nights.
"It's a fire that attracts people because we don't understand something", says Neal Baer, producer of ABC's "Descent", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, the veteran comedy writer and author of "Only the Fun Parts and Some Unpleasant Truths" about how to sneak into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he'd vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "He's making me laugh", Scovell told me.
Chaos is valuable because it's attractive.
Of course, unlike other shows on television, the stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the unification of immigrant families, and the state of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged can afford.
And yet, it's more than enough to inform a citizen when you realize that you've been watching for six hours a panel of experts discuss how Bob Woodward uses classified data for his book The Family, Paul Manafort demonstrates a $15,000 ostrich leather jacket, and what the stunning anatomy description by Stormy Daniels Trump means.
At least I'll never watch Super Mario the same way again.
"His actions are like a reality show, because every night he gives you something to think about, about the changing characters of the Trump show and the daily twists and turns of the plot (involvement in the conflict with the NFL or praise for Kim Jong-un)", says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars.
You can't miss a single show or you'll be left behind.
When I contacted Fleiss this week, it was 27 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, and it was sunny, but he was inside, and he was watching MSNBC on CNN.
He couldn't have gotten any bigger, certainly not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we did this crazy show, people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss said.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

The midterm elections are a hot-button race for the House of Representatives.
No wonder the redistricting that ended with two House members trying to win the same seat, made Pennsylvania's 17th District a cash-strapped one.
The recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh has brought Democratic House member Conor Lamb into the fray, winning his seat in a special election last spring in another district.
Lamb is competing with fellow Republican House of Representatives member Keith Rothfuss, who is currently representing Pennsylvania's former 12th District, much of which overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were reviewed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old counties had been rigged in violation of the Constitution for the benefit of Republicans.
During the campaign in the new 17th district, the main party financial institutions  Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC)  struggled over campaign finance.
Lamb made headlines in Pennsylvania when he narrowly won the 18th Congressional District in a widely watched March special election.
For more than a decade, the seat has been held by Republicans, with President Donald Trump winning the district by 20 points.
The political experts gave the Democrats a certain advantage.
The U.S. considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but then a truce
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, but had received virtually no negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump attended a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and had a hotel in the country before the partners moved the Trump Organization's leadership.
"As a result of recent decisions to withdraw recognition of Taiwan, officials from the State Department have decided to remove the heads of American diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama", Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement released earlier this month.
The Sanctions Committee is responsible for the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the situation of the Palestinian Authority in the Middle East.
The proposed sanctions, including reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions on certain individuals, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder rates.
In an internal meeting, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to follow a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a major step forward in preventing migrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made clear their desire for the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
"In an effort to show the importance the administration attaches to this gathering, Vice President Mike Pence is now on the list of speakers for the conference scheduled for mid-October", the diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without reporting any reprimands or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the debate reported by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussions only if their anonymity was maintained.
Their stories are corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke, provided his anonymity is maintained.
Learn from history
The report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of justice by Trump  very strong evidence of this is now available in the public archives.
And as we speak, Mueller's investigation is focused on whether the Trump campaign was operating in collusion with Russia, which is harming our election.
If Congress were to change hands, Trump would have to take responsibility for this institution at the same time as he prepares to face the voters again, and perhaps eventually the Board of Governors.
There's a lot of hypocrisy here, and I'm not denying that Trump's demise is inevitable, as is his European counterpart.
We're all going to have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and those choices will determine how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, but only if the West resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We got together and missed the opportunity to prevent the slaughter that would follow for several years.
History revolves around such crucial turning points, when the unbreakable march of democracy is accelerated or halted.
Now Americans are at a number of these critical turning points.
What do we do if Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who's responsible for the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein's confusion began when the paper reported that last year an official had offered to secretly enroll the president and consider his incompetence.
Rosenstein claims that the Times story is inaccurate.
What would be our reaction if the new FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or inaccurate or if, despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony, this candidate is appointed to the Supreme Court?
And finally, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy faces a long winter.
But the lesson I learned in Prague, I believe we'll keep them.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had occupied the house where I had lived as ambassador.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, they sent me to light Sabbath candles on a swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I look down on our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers is looking forward to the Rapid Vienna clash.
On Thursday, Rangers Rapid Vienna will accept that, after an impressive match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, if they win against Austria, they could be in a strong position to leave Group G.
A knee injury limited midfielder Graham Dorrans to just 2-2 against Villarreal for the first time this season, but he hopes Rangers can use this as a stepping stone to bigger goals.
"We had a good result because Villarreal is a great team", said the 31-year-old.
We started the game with the hope of getting something, and we ended up getting something.
Maybe we could have been more peaceful in the end, but overall the competition was not bad.
They probably played better in the first half, and we got in the second half and showed who we were.
There's another big Europa League night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, it's going to be a tough game because they've done great in the last few games, but I'm sure with the support of the fans we can push forward and get a good result.
Last year was really tough and what happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a good mood.
The team is good and the guys are really happy; you're training great.
I hope we can push on, forget about last season and play well.
This fear of retirement savings causes women to suffer from insomnia
Although the respondents had a clear idea of the type of care they would like to receive, few discussed it with family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they had discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don't want to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
That's where you start.
If you do not make your wishes known, you will not prepare your family to care for you.
Discuss with your counsellor and your family where and what kind of care you would like to receive, as these factors may be important in estimating costs.
A financial adviser can also help you to think of ways to pay for these expenses.
You can choose to pay for long-term care by means of a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a mixed cash value life insurance policy or by securing your assets while you have money.
Select legal documents. Use protective documents to prevent legal disputes.
Appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and ensure that your wishes are respected if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the authority to look after your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that bills are paid should you become unable to work.

Man shot multiple times with a pneumatic rifle in Ilfraco
After spending the evening in the city, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic pistol as he walked home.
The victim, aged 40, was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm in Oxford's Graves area of Devon, Ilfrafrack.
The shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 a.m. UK Summer Time, was described by officials as an accidental act.
The victim didn't see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are asking for witnesses' help.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people died after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with more expected to die.
Due to the destruction of the communications relief services, officials could not obtain any data from the area of Dongla Regency  north of Palu, located near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from the city of Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about the people of Palu and Dongal on Sulawesi Island.
With a population of about 379,800 in 2017, Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, established at the narrow western end of the bay on the coast of Sulawesi Island.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi.
The regency  sub-provincial administrative region  had a population of approximately 299 200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, although it is mainly concentrated in Moroval, on the other side of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past century.
In 1938, the Donglu tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In addition, the western city of Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia, a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is a constantly shaking country.
Consider some of the most significant earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years.
On 26 December 2004, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
In late March and early April 2005, several powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the nearby island of Nias.
In 2006, a 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the southern part of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
In 2009, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
In 2010, a 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami with waves up to 33 feet [10 m] high, which swept away dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
In 2016, the Pidija Jaya Regency in Aceh was devastated by a devastating earthquake, and panic erupted as people remembered how everything was destroyed after the terrible 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not strike, but collapsing buildings killed over 100 people.
In 2018, strong earthquakes shook the tourist-heavy island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists on the coast.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on the assault charges.
A report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police said that 29-year-old Palin, of Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of justice and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report a suspected crime, he took her phone away.
According to KTU, Palin was returned to the Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Center for his custody and released on $500 bail.
He appeared in court on Saturday and was asked to plead not guilty, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means she faces up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Pauline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a suspected assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, obstruction of justice for domestic violence, and possession of a firearm in a custodial setting.
His girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin received criticism from veterans groups for associating her son's brutal behavior with the traumatic stress disorder he suffered from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos of the tsunami's impact are being shared on social media.
The tsunami struck the coast while hundreds of people were gathering for a beach party in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for a suspect in a New York terrorist attack.
In New York, federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayful Saipov, suspected of carrying out the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare execution that has not been carried out in this state for federal crimes since 1953.
On October 31, 30-year-old Saipov of Home Depot allegedly rented a truck and attacked a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan while riding on the path, killing pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a notice of intent to execute in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally caused serious bodily injury.
According to the court document, both of these charges carry the death penalty.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, assault with intent to commit property (usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases), and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors say the attack was well planned and premeditated, and the way Saipov carried it out was disgusting, cruel and immoral.
'As a result of the actions of Sayfullo Habibullaevicius Saipov, the following family members and friends were injured, injured and lost loved ones: Diego Enrique Angelino, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlija, Hernano Ferruchio, Hernano Diego Mendozos and Alejandro Damiano Pagnucco', the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last case to seek the death penalty was a trial in the Southern District of New York a decade ago.
The accused Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last execution was in 1953 in a federal case in New York for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not regret his actions either immediately after the attack or for several months afterward.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov revealed to the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of the Islamic State (ISIS) that he watched on his phone.
Police said he also asked to have the Islamic State flag hoisted in the hospital's ward.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federally funded attorneys representing Saipov, said they were clearly disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than pleading guilty and serving life without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecution not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP says Brexit negotiations must be led by Nigel Farage
At a protest at the Tory conference today, Nigel Farage promised to mobilize the nation's army.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the heat of the Eurosceptics, and one of Theresa May's party MPs suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would have stood by now if Farage had been the Brexit secretary.
But the difficulties May faces in trying to unite her divided ranks were revealed by the pro-Remain bloc who joined a separate protest in the city against Brexit.
It is difficult for the Prime Minister to implement the compromise plan agreed in her Chequers when she is under attack from the "Brexit" supporters, opponents and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostile reaction and would force the Eurosceptics and Labour Party to choose her package or chaos.
Bones said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to screw up the Chequers' plan.
He argued that Farage should have been an equal partner and should have been given the responsibility to negotiate with Brussels.
If he had led, we would have left the EU by now, he said.
The Welsh MP added: 'I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers plan.'
He said that he was opposed to the EU, saying that we did not fight in the world wars to obey others.
In our country, we want to make our own laws.
'Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.
Pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkins was also at the demonstration and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and it is unpopular with our party members and activists who are taking to the streets and, most importantly, voting for us.
You can reject the Chequers plan and start listening.
In a critical statement, May added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Farage said the rallying politicians must be made to feel the heat if they release the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it's a question of trust between us, the nation and our political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, so we're here today to tell them we're not going to get away with it.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to make our political class, which almost betrayed Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the army of this nation, which has brought us victory over Brexit, and we will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and great United Kingdom.
And the anti-Brexit protesters marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
When the group formed this weekend, a group of activists waved Tory-Brexit posters.
Labour's Lord Adonis has laughed at the Conservatives over the security problems they experienced over the party's programme at the start of the conference.
'These are people who say they can put in place the IT systems and all the technology they need for Canada plus plus, frictionless borders and borderless free trade with Ireland,' he said.
This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November, where she will meet GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, one of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign leaders.
There was speculation that she might meet Trump in 2020.
Since Trump became president, the Saturday afternoon event at Holyoake has been her 36th meeting with voters using the public-facing format.
One participant asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and it had to be led by a woman.
Suspect arrested in the LSU Sims shooting
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said Saturday they have arrested a suspect accused of shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At a press conference at 11:00 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department announced that 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson had been arrested.
Police released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man seen in it.
20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near the South Campus early Friday.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday that Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from his injuries.
Wayde was standing up to defend his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson has not resisted arrest and has been remanded in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-8 senior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season, starting 10 of them, averaging 17.4 minutes per game, 5.6 points per game and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approached the world title when the team told him to give the win to Sebastian Vettel
When Walter Bott beat Lewis Hamilton in Saturday's qualifying race, it was immediately clear that Mercedes' team guidance would be crucial in the race.
Starting the race from first place, Bott made a great start and, defending his position in the first two corners, almost left Hamilton in trouble, prompting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Wettle was the first to go into the two-car garage, left Hamilton and he came back to the race in the group's tail, so it was a decisive one.
The Mercedes crashed into the two-car garage behind the wheel and returned to the track behind Vettel, but Hamilton was forced to go forward after a few unfinished moves when the Ferrari driver unintentionally released the inside of the track after a double maneuver to preserve his position in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back of the grid, but by the end of the first lap he was already seventh.
He was the fastest for most of the race, as he drove without changing his tyres to get as fast as possible to the finish, overtaking Kimi Raikkonen and finishing fourth.
Finally, on lap 44, he crashed into the two-car garage, but failed to increase his pace for the remaining eight laps and Raikkonen crossed the finish line in the fourth.
Walter had a rough day because he had a great weekend, and when he asked me to come over, he was a real gentleman.
"The team did a great job and clinched the first two spots", Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein during a Saturday meeting with the public for her stubborn denial of a leaked letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate showed that people are mean, uncivilized and unjust.
"What could have happened and is actually happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people are angry, bad, dirty and unfair", he said.
When you see official statements and leaks, and then you say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you run away?
Remember her answer to the question, did she leak the document?
I certainly don't.
I didn't.
Well, wait a minute.
Did we run away... no, we didn't", he added, impersonating the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, which had been leaked earlier in September, but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from her office.
According to The Hill, Feinstein told the committee, "I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations and I did not cover up her story".
She asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as she asked.
But the president apparently disagreed with her denial, and he said in a meeting with the public on Saturday night, "You know, that was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
In his defense of a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the accusations to their advantage.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the immorality; they don't care what they hurt or what they have to go through to get power and control", the president quoted in the media.
The elite league, the Dundee Stars, the Belfast Giants,
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against the Giants in Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered from their defeat to the Belfast Giants in the Premier League on Friday and won their replay on Saturday at Dundee with a score of 5-3
The Giants took an early lead with two free throws to win by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyane again led the Giants.
Francois Bouchard of the Dundee team equalized the score, but later two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured the victory.
Adam Keefe's men suffered their third defeat in the Elite League this season, before they were beaten 2-1 by Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, the previous three games won by the Giants.
Dwyer made his first goal in the fourth minute (3.35) after a pass from Kendall McFaul, and after four minutes, Beauvillier doubled down on a pass from David Rutherford.
In a hard-fought game, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game with a 13-10 lead, and after Matt Marquardt's pass, Cownie equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer led the Giants into the first half with a lead, and at the end of the first inning, he scored his second of the night.
With a quantitative advantage, the owners regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen push Dundee forward for the first time in the game at the end of the second inning, and cemented the victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the final inning.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will face Milton Keynes at home next Friday.
A flight attendant died to help hundreds of passengers escape the earthquake
An Indonesian airline executive was hailed as a hero after he died helping a plane carrying several hundred passengers safely into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continued to be battered by strong earthquakes and by large numbers of people trapped in the ruins of Palu.
While colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily-swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained at his post to assist in the safe take-off of Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was already on the runway at the time.
Then, thinking the flight control tower was about to collapse, he jumped out of it.
She later died in hospital.
According to Australian ABC News, Yohannes Sirait, an Indonesian air navigation spokesman, said that his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We took him by helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We are deeply saddened by this news", he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, as the country's disaster management agency reports that the cities of Dangala, Sigi and Boutonga are hard to reach.
"The number of victims is expected to rise further as many victims are still under the rubble and cannot be reached", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 20 feet [6 m] high have devastated the city of Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supply.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "There are victims coming in every minute from fast cars.
Clean water is scarce.
Self-service stores are being robbed everywhere.
Janis Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in the earthquakes that struck Lombok, Indonesia.
Air News now claims one person is missing after plane crashes into a lagoon
The airline that operated the flight, which ended in a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean basin of Micronesia, now says one person is missing, although it previously said all 47 passengers and crew members had been rescued from the sinking plane.
In a report, Air New Guinea said it had no knowledge of a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airlines did not immediately respond to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
A local boat helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, all of them in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon, missing its runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane failed to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had crashed from very low.
"That was very good", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that in a sinking, waist-deep plane, he and the others managed to get to the emergency exits.
He said the flight crew were panicked and screaming, and he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that while repairing a nearby pier, its sailors also helped rescue people who were flown ashore in inflatable boats before the plane sank to a depth of about 100 feet [30 m].
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
The analyst has laid out the sequence of events on the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution has presented the facts in a new trial Saturday of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as a court expert in the area of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chamber on the night of her death, which contradicts previous claims.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford made his position known and testified that he was not in his town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tallis was telling the truth about being in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because his truck was in Nashville.
Another coincidence was that Tallis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tells deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Halley.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he thought the case would be referred to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative perception of the genre by spreading positive messages through their music.
The High Breed of Bristol argues that hip-hop moves away from its political roots and focuses on social issues.
They want to go back to the roots of hip-hop and re-populate conscious hip-hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently been revived in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?!
A New York City teacher sues a couple after being fired for a racist message
A New York City teacher sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a text message from a mother who complained that she was "also single black".
The couple denies any racism and called the lawsuit "rape".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was upset to learn that Giselle Maurice, the new babysitter, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEE, FOR ONE DAY", Mr Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to his husband.
But twice she sent it not to her husband, but to Mr. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, Plasco-Flaxman felt uncomfortable and fired Maurice, saying that the former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was hoping to get a Filipino instead.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice has sued the couple for severance pay and is seeking as little as $350 a day for six months of living and working in the home of a client to whom she was originally hired without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", she said in a Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied the racial accusations and argued that it was wise to fire Maurice because they feared that he would not be able to trust her after he had offended her.
My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists, the man Joel Plasco said.
Would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even though it was a mistake?
Your newborn?
I don't think so. I'm not sure.
Plasc, who likened the case to rape, said his wife had just given birth two months earlier and was in a very difficult situation.
You're going to sue me for that?
This is not very nice behaviour, added the investment banker.
While the trial was ongoing, the media rushed to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's editors feared that readers would not understand the bear's speech
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It's hard to feel like you're in another place reading a book for the first time before it's published.
Now it's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's tremendous success.
She said that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before finding inspiration to write a children's book about the teddy bear, would not have been too upset if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication a year after his father's death was both pleasant and sad.
Speaking of Paddington, whom she describes as a very important member of the family, she added that the father was quietly proud of his success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he didn't like to get drunk", she said.
Because Paddington was so much like himself, he felt like he had a child who had accomplished something: you were proud of him, even though it wasn't really your job.
I think he had a similar view of Paddington's success story.
Although it was his own creation and the product of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was unforgettable, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Hospital de Niço-Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were unable to save her life.
"Nad kept calling and saying that she was in really bad shape, that she wasn't expected to survive", said Mr. Ednan-Laperouse.
Then I got a call from Nad, who called to say she had two minutes to live and I had to say goodbye.
And I said goodbye.
I told her, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'll be with you.
The medication that kept her heart beating slowly stopped working and was eliminated.
She died a little while ago and that was the end of it.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn't bite, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep it to myself.
Finally, Mr. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unaware of the ordeal she was facing.
"No one knew", she said.
My head was down and I was crying all the time.
It's hard to explain why, but it was on the plane that I felt the greatest pity for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Postcards of grieving women to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Wales Bridge are distributing postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers for people to call and ask for help.
Mr. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed, and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any father to feel the way I have to feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Linden, said that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said his smile lit up the room.
But he threw the job away before he died, because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother who had committed suicide.
Mr. Davis said, "I'm afraid there's going to be a chain reaction".
Mr. Davis designed postcards to let people know that there are people around who they can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still, you have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mr Davies, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, who retired shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he was depressed, depressed, and he didn't complain", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
The situation was absolutely bad at Christmas: when the children were unwrapping their presents, he didn't look them in the eye or react.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: It left a void in their family.
It breaks our hearts.
But we all have to live and fight.

When the FBI opened an investigation, Brett Kavanaugh's future was hanging in the balance.
I thought if we could actually get something he asked for -- a limited-length, limited-scale study -- maybe we could bring in some unity, Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was in the grip of solid supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their objection is only due to time.
With only five weeks left until the November 6 midterm elections, if the Republicans do not do as they are expected to, their efforts to elect the man they want to the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush called the senators to try to convince them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI submits their report?
A vote will be taken in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get 50 votes in the Senate to allow Vice President Mike Pence to cut ties and confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Since Kim came to power, the number of North Korean defectors has been declining.
South Korea's legislature said the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of South Korea, said that 1 127 deserters were identified last year, compared to 2 706 in 2011.
The Commission also noted that the Chinese authorities had not provided any evidence of the existence of any other illegal activities in the Union.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Many North Korean defectors were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for talks centered on the nuclear denuclearization.
This followed the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed in principle to make the Korean Peninsula a nuclear-weapon-free zone.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not having reversed its sanctions since then.
"If we don't trust the United States, we can't trust our national security, and in such circumstances we will never be the first to unilaterally disarm", Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi finds Brett Kavanaugh historical and claims he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "Historian" and has said he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
I just can't help but think that if a woman did that, she'd be called hysterical. Pelosi gave her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening remarks, when discussing his family and high school days, Mr. Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming or yelling.
He also condemned the former Democrats on the committee after being accused of "grotesque and coordinated reputational destruction" by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi argued that Kavanaugh's demonstrations proved he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he had exposed his biased view of Democrats.
"I think he's disqualified himself with his statements and the attacks of the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Asked if she would seek to remove Kavanaugh if his candidacy was approved and Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi objected.
"I'll say yes, if he's lying to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to serve not only on the Supreme Court, but on the court he's serving now", Pelosi said.
Mr. Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Mr Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to hysterically, biasedly, become a judge and say, 'How wonderful!' " said Pelosi.
The Power Women Should Exercise
It's a legitimate criticism that will eventually spill over into months and even years of heaped anger that she can't express without tears.
"When we're angry, we cry". Miss Stein told me after 45 years.
It doesn't seem unusual to me, does it?
She continued: "I was helped a lot by a woman, a manager of a company, who told me that she also cries when she's angry, but she invented a method: when she gets angry and starts crying, she would say to the person she's talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm actually pissed off.
And she just kept crying.
I thought it was genius.
Tears are considered acceptable expressions of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories is of my first job in a male-dominated office, where I started crying out of untold rage, and then I was grabbed by an older woman, a tough boss, who always scared me a little, and she pulled me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he told me.
They don't know you're mad.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy to beat you.
Democratic congresswoman from Colorado Patricia Schroeder worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was caught off guard on the ship "Monkey Business" (an aphorism meaning "Lowly Time") and withdrew his candidacy, Mr Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why he could not run for president himself.
It wasn't a well-thought-out decision, he told me laughing 30 years later.
There were seven other candidates at that time, so there was no need for another.
Someone called me Snowball with Seven Wands.
With her campaign running late, she had little time to raise funds, so she vowed not to announce her candidacy until she had raised $2 million.
It was an unequal fight.
She noticed that some sponsors, who had given men $1,000 each, were giving her only $250.
"Did they think I was getting a discount?" she wondered.
In her speech announcing the launch of her formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions  gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and reach voters directly instead of representatives, and anger at sexism that she was devastated.
"You'd think I was getting nervous", recalled Ms Schroeder, "and the reaction of the press to her speech.
You'd think I was backed by the Kleenex towel business.
I remember thinking about what would be written on my tombstone.
Did she cry?
How the US-China trade era can benefit Beijing
The first steps in the U.S.-China trade war are underway, and although the battle is far from over, experts say the dispute may prove to be a win-win for Beijing in the long run.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by levying tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most intense opposition came this week when new tariffs came into effect affecting goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion), which will essentially tax half of China's exports to the US.
Beijing responded to all of these measures with the latest decision to impose tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on US goods worth a total of $60 billion.
China has vowed to fight the United States tooth by tooth, and it looks like the world's second-largest market is definitely not going to go down any time soon.
Washington would only ease sanctions if China complied, but publicly bowing to the US would be too lenient for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing does its fair share, the difficulties of the trade war with the US could have a positive impact on China in the long run, as it will reduce the interdependence of these markets.
"The fact that a sudden political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would disrupt the economies of both countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have so far admitted", said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Asia.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country ready to take back refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country, which has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'As a result of progress in the fight against terrorism, the situation in the area has become much more stable and secure,' he said.
The government continues to work to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists and to restore normalcy.
The conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to countries they have been forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that are detrimental to their daily lives and well-being are now in place.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the war began in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, it also stressed that the country would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries supporting the insurgency.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team, defeating the USA in a final score of 16.5:10.5, won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost six straight in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup on that continent since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored 14.5 points, enough to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had struggled throughout the tournament, launched from the starting field into the water in the 16th hole in the third-pair match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian player F. Molinari has excelled in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 record since the tournament took its current form in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was defeated 5-4 by Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark, a player from the lowest ranked European team.
World's highest rated Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup tournament.
Eight-time Ryder Cup champion Sergio Garcia of Spain became the most successful European player of all time at the tournament, with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't cry often, but I can't help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Mr. Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm very happy, very happy that we got the cup back.
It's all about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said the emotional S. Garcia after the European victory.
He hands the relay to his countryman John Ram, who in Sunday's single-elimination match, defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
That's a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major prizes and falling just short of Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team failed to hit the turf all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who demonstrated a high level of play throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk, U.S.A., after a disappointing team performance, said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a certain moment this morning when we started to press the Europeans.
We were screwing.
I'm wearing my hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You got to bow your head.
Our opponents were superior.
Red flood news: concentrations are falling in Painelas, Manati and Sarasoto
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) states that the overall concentration of Yellowfin in the Tampa Bay watershed is decreasing.
According to the FWC, more fragmented blooms have been observed in the districts of Painela, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier  suggesting a decreasing concentration.
The Red Flood flooded approximately 130 miles of coastline from Pine Ridge in the north to Lee County in the south.
Burning areas can be found about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
The red flood was also observed in Easter County.
Concentrations were reported last week as average in Pineellas County and along its coastline, along the Hillsborough County coastline from low to high, in Manatee County from low to high, in Sarasota County and along the coastline from low to high, in Charlotte County from low to mid, along the coastline of Lee County from low to high, and in Collier County, on the ground.
There are still reports of respiratory tract irritation in Paines, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
There have been no reports of respiratory tract irritation in northwest Florida in the past week.
