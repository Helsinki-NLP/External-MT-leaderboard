While there appears to be one experimental vaccine that can reduce Ebola deaths, so far, no drugs have been found that are suitable for treating the existing infection.
One cocktail of antibodies, ZMapp, was initially promising in this area, but official studies indicated that the benefit of this cocktail was less than the benefits sought in preventing death.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning that scientists put it as a basis and compared the other three treatments with it.
United States Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee's mission and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the U.S. Olympic Committee's statement that the interests of athletes, clubs, and their sport, can be better served by moving forward with meaningful change within our organization, rather than withdrawing licenses.
The USA Gymnastics is supporting an independent investigation that may shed light on how Larry Nassar's survivors' courageous description of relative abuse could have gone undetected for a long time without embracing any necessary and appropriate changes.
USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee have the same goal: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and empowering environment.

Not only does it confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details that fossils generally fail to provide, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish brown above and pale or carotenoid-colored below.
The discovery also provides a deep understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have a fully evolved skeletal chain, called the "spine", but had other feather characteristics -- like protrusions and miniature protrusions -- researchers concluded that the spine was most likely a later evolutionary origin of these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation or for display. The researchers suggest that although this tail belonged to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult feather and not a chicken-like butt.
The researchers pointed out that although this is a small dinosaur tail, the specimen shows adult bird feathers, not chicken feathers.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is determined only by their brightness and rotation.
Photography and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rosby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The lower the Rosby number, the less the star's activity relative to magnetic fluctuations.

The 802.11n wireless standard operates at 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz.
The standard's ability to operate at two frequencies allows it to be compatible with its predecessor standards, namely 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided that the base station has dual radios.
802.11n speeds are much higher than its predecessor speeds with a maximum theoretical output of 600 megabits per second.
Duval, married with two adult sons, left no lasting impression on the Miller who was the focus of the story.

He did not specify a figure for the cuts, saying they would depend on China's economic output.
It is to urge developing countries to "avoid the old way of polluting first and cleaning up later".
"However, they should not be forced to assume obligations beyond their developmental stage, their responsibility and their abilities", he added.
The Iraq Study Group has submitted its report at 12:00 GMT today.
He cautions that no one can guarantee that any course of action at this moment in Iraq will lead to an end to sectarian war, rising violence or a descent into chaos.
This report also begins with a call for open debate, and for the formation of a collective consensus in the United States on policy toward the Middle East.

The effect the team looked for is attributed to tidal forces between the dark matter in the Milky Way and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon attracts the earth and causes tides, the Milky Way attracts the shooting galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that natural matter does.
This theory explains that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a halo-like shape, made up of small particles in large numbers.

They're colder than the ocean surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as constant as large caves on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with being deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the USGS and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: where voters lock themselves in a booth, and place a pre-printed piece of paper pointing to their favorite candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law regulates the procedure unfavorably strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can ensure that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting, and that only envelopes are added for registered and authorized voters by assets and delegates.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision following specific procedures.

The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Edinburgh Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adeccoya has been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from an eyewitness could be questionable because her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts have considered that the publication of images is potentially biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it seems to me that journalists are definitely going in a dangerous direction if they publish pictures or something like that of a suspect".
The Crown Office, which is generally responsible for the allegations, has indicated to reporters that there will be no further comment until at least after the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will point to a border dispute, which Palestine wants built on the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is an important issue for both peoples, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a ten-year military presence in the Ghor once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a five-year military presence.
The guards had to closely supervise the shooters in the complementary pest control trial, as the experiment was under surveillance and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Trust and the Sport Archery Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were selected for the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of NPWS's Parks and Heritage Conservation Organization, the four fishermen selected for the first hunt have received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday in a new nine-member provisional electoral council.
It's Martelli's fifth temporary election board in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the interim electoral board as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was in the position of a martial response to the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, have erupted over the failure of elections scheduled since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctions in the iPod overheating have been reported, which may have caused a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 hardware-related incidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional burnout incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The department responded to Apple's request for a delay to report as "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (09:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there are no indications of a tsunami wave.
A former Filipino policeman took hostages from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and elderly, as well as the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and took medicine as his profession.
He trained as an obstetrician and then began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Lygens began investigating preterm birth in his spare time, during his work at the hospital.
His research showed that when one of the hormones is given, it accelerates the maturation of the lung in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered the flight recorders, or so-called "black boxes", on Wednesday.
As the fellow wrestlers praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Lona was the first radical queen. My first boss, Luna, died on a moonlit night. A strong, unique woman".
Dustin Goldst Runnels commented, "Lona was as weird as I am... maybe more so... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the proportion who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled agree with this view, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the next queen of Australia.
On the opposite side of the poll, 29% of those polled thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% thought Australia should never be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist's fitness was questioned because of his complaints, as he was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
He couldn't take the pain medication because it's forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software as early as February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water to the Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, and specifically how the Earth formed after comets hit the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political and absurd chatter".
He's likely to run for president in 2016.
Nexagen is a system that the FAA claims will allow planes to fly on shorter trajectories, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-linked technology unlike the older technology that uses ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate a plane with higher accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
There are no additional transportation, no underground trains stop at Wembley, and no parking facilities, parking and riding facilities on the ground.
Concerns about lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would have to be held behind closed doors, without the team's supporters present.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the evolution of new species took only two generations - although it was thought that the process took much longer - because of the breeding between the Darwin's resident, the medium-sized ground bird, the migratory cactus, and the sharp-billed ground bird.
Gold can be shaped in many ways.
It can be pulled into a thin wire that can be rolled up and rearranged.
It can be made very thin, and it can be glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH of the chemical, and you can make an index of that number with red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The level of the hydrogen base is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are electronless protons (where hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Turn the dry powders together and then squeeze them with clean, wet hands until they are ball-shaped.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of cover.
My towns of Harapa and Mohenjo-Daro had toilets with drains in almost every home connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in homes in the towns of Mennoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women attended together in a mixed company.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back at about the same moment.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in amazing ways, but the most important thing it has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits, deer and deer.
Finally, many small cats (including the big cats) eat smaller prey in larger numbers such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of status, a special function for each cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called packs.
The black family consists of one to three adult males, plus up to thirty females and lions.
The females are usually closer together, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions acts like a pack of wolves or dogs, and surprisingly, the animals are similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior and are very lethal to their prey.
As a complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a human.
The tiger is in the same group as the black, spotted and Uighur tigers. These four are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not the full-throated roar of a lion, but it is closer to a scream of angry words.
The dwarf tiger likes to eat small animals, hunting monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if it can.
Scientists believe that Asylum cats track and find prey by sense of smell; they smell where they've been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark with night vision, and they move very stealthily too.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population group to which they belong (for example if they move across a mountain range or river, or move to a new island so that they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from the one they were in before.
Because this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the new group will need different properties or ways of adapting to become a stronger competitor than it did before.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same ways of adaptation as we have.
Over time, as the new populations begin to adapt to their new environment, they gradually become less similar to other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will look so different that we can't call them the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of a new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans leave behind (i.e., sphaeras).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is also from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the dominant predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything, except other mosasaurs.
Her long jaws were studded with over 70 blade-like glands plus another set in the roof of her mouth, which means there's no escaping anything that stands in her way.
We don't know for sure, but he probably had a flared tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he was probably a carnivore.
It also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not match it.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual holiday elements, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a species of rodent called the owl.
There was another difference that while the poor and women ate their meals sitting on the benches, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they leaned on their side while they ate their homework.
Ancient Roman meals could not include foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods and it was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods during festivals and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard leading to a safe space that only priests could enter.
Sometimes unique pyramid-shaped towers called zigguras were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, home didn't matter much.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; shops were just open stands overlooking the street.
There were not many forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was expensive.
People have inhabited Greenland sporadically. In Norse epics, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Regardless of its discovery, the Eskimos lived there before.
There were many differences between people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, even though each country was Scandinavian.
If you've ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although the author of this portion of the text is not known exactly, we do know that the large manuscript (measuring 293‚ÅÑ4 by 241‚ÅÑ2 inches) was folded at its beginning.
So, it's likely that the symbol was simply added as a label.
The landings of that day and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was not yet liberated.
France was ruled by Vichy, the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France, and were on their way to Germany.
Civilization is an individual culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, as a community.
The origin of the word civilization is from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the way the community is structured.
Civilization implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural imprint and the equitable dissemination of knowledge.
Microcultures often vanish without leaving any actual historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole component - under the Constitution of the Union.
Congress lacked any power to tax, and because it lacked national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
In addition, you have no authority to override state-to-state tax laws and tariffs.
Articles required unanimous approval by all states before they could be amended and states mocked the central government so much that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to - from a geographical perspective - as an "archipel".
Taiwan started to return in the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the name lha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began changing native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War between 1894 and 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, in which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 millimeters, the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
Their production continues to this day, but more importantly, the image sensors in digital cameras have inherited their high resolution.
The 35mm model is actually, a little bit confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this image is going to be (when you divide by 12 to get the ratio of the simplest integer) so it's going to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the Advanced Image System set, for example) have or approximate this aspect ratio.
The misused, often mocked, rule of thirds is a simple guiding principle that creates dynamics while keeping a certain amount of order in the picture.
The most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
The Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has bound European nations together for over a thousand years despite differences in language and customs.
The all-encompassing power she wielded affected everyone from the king to the common people.
Among the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church money exists especially for this purpose.
It was the central authority of the church in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question how well it meets the requirements of the creed.
Britain soon began to surround Germany by sea after the skirmishes broke out.
The strategy of cutting off vital military and civilian supplies has proven effective, despite the fact that this blockade violates generally accepted international law, which has been codified and coordinated in several international conventions over the past two centuries.
Britain has sealed off international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sections of the ocean, threatening even neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were peaceful and isolated.
After seeing the horrors of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each stage of China or each dynasty in power was of a different kind.
In addition, there was an unstable era of divided provinces between each ruling dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the 60-year Three Kingdoms era between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war broke out between several nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms era is one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the fight to sit on the highest seats in the Grand Palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political implications, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just to the ruler.
And after the Revolution, the careers were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military because instead of ranking the military based on class, it's now based on merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class sons in other countries to disarm their revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as "Hara" on top of the Mount of Light for meditation.
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, presents a very vivid picture of the prophet Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
And in fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
Nothing is visible but the beautiful clear sky over the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century CE, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramids built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Funeral City of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), small tombs, temples, and the Abbey of the Holy Sepulchre.
The largest pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up" sign looks like a V and the "down" sign looks like a pedestal or a square without a bottom.
A higher sign means you should start at the end and push the bow, while a lower sign means you should start at the end of the bow (where you hold the bow) and pull it.
The upper arch usually produces a softer sound, while the lower arch is stronger and firmer.
Feel free to draw your own pencil marks, but remember that curved printed marks exist for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
Terrified, King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Mary Theresa, 11, Louis Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a huge crowd of people shouting and cheering against the king and queen.
A crowd of people managed to force the King and Queen to open their car windows on her windows.
A gang member once waved the head of a Royal Guard member killed in Versailles in front of the panicked queen.
The Filipino people are bearing the costs of the US imperialist war in its invasion of the Philippines.
These were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial system to cover a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will be the basic gains of US imperialism.
We need to understand the context that motivated the creation of the organization, so we can accommodate the Knights Templar.
The era in which these events took place was known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which all ended around 1500.
Technological inevitability is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the drive for technology or technological necessity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
There are two general ideas common to most explanations of technological inevitability: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond cultural or political influence, and that this technology in turn has "effects" on communities that are rooted, rather than linked to society.
For example, one might say that the motor of the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But building a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new ways are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Collective car ownership also leads to higher rates of road accidents, leading to the invention of new technologies in healthcare to treat damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural inevitability derived from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture connected to that geography arose, and these, as being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a centre of luxury began in 400 AD and lasted until 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned carrying gifts such as silk and spices which were of higher value than the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, Paris was called the fashion capital instead of Constantinople.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th or 11th to the 14th centuries.
Initially, Byzantine culture in the East had a strong influence on clothing.
And yet, because of the slowness of communication channels, patterns in the West may be as much as 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of that time was as a result of the Crusades when people began to use buttons to tie clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Livelihood farming, often organic, is a simple system in which stored seeds are used to match the ecosystem of the area, as well as crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yield.
Most farmers have historically worked for a living, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures reconcile like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, race, class, location and/or gender.
The traits that define a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures indicate their membership through the different and symbolic use of style that includes clothing, cost, and terminology.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who have suffered, through neglect, bad luck or deliberate abuse, from being socially unaffiliated by adults during their upbringing.
Some lost children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment was due to the parent's refusal to allow the child to have severe mental or physical disabilities.
Savage children may have been abused as children or suffered severe trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised by nonhuman animals, the feral child shows behaviors (within physical limits) that are exactly like those of a private pet, such as fear of humans or indifference to them.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning but rather an aid that provides support to individuals who are going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual and on the ground, in other words, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, and so is the paper clip man in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported internally in the programme and aims to ask questions, motivate and explain actions that may be difficult for the student to handle on his or her own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not based on upbringing, care and education, but they do.
We understand that the alternative care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our adoption system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Alternative care must provide all the essentials that they lacked in the homes they left before.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The Internet's distinctive characteristics lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and methods of satisfaction.
For example, some suggest "learning" and "socialisation" as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) when they studied audience reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting facial expressions, which are facial movements that last for a few fractions of a second.
In particular, it is claimed that one can discover whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting subtle expressions.
Oliver Sachs points out in his paper that the president's speech suggests that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are able to accurately assess honesty.
He even proposes that these abilities to analyze human behavior are shared by some animals, such as pet dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two groups of Chinese varieties: a latent group and a phenomenal group.
Mutation adds new genetic differences, and selection removes them from the aggregation of expressive differences.
The processes of separation and reassembly make the variation randomly back and forth between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, primates with digestive systems similar to humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Failure to do so will also lead to dire consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
And the most readily available plant resources were proteins that you could get from leaves and pulses, but these proteins are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, and eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide high amounts of protein and contain all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors somehow solved their protein problem the same way chimpanzees do in the savannah.
Sleep apnea is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (10 to 60 minutes).
And this can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, based on the biosystem, include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more positivity the life force brings. Everyone has the inherent ability to find peace and secure contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been extended through the Mahayana path of love and other techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces all.
Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga pauses, breathing exercises, chanting and imagery, with Kundalini yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god Yuga. By imagining the various gods, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, but as the war ended, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to conflict between the two nations.
Two years after the war ended, former allies are now enemies and the Cold War has begun.
This war was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and the fighting was supposed to be on the ground, by proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Roman Bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and formed the two Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships for transporting goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure your country's ability to move your people and their goods, while at the same time, intercepting your enemy's ability to move their people and their goods.
One of the most notable recent examples is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy was trying to counter this invasion with its submarine force.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to invade Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated nearly 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Goats were generally raised in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often by goat herders who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the widely known shepherd. These grazing methods are still used today.
Wagon roads were created in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the old railway carriages were only made of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speeds and to pull larger loads than the roads that were considered more rugged at the time.
Train rails were invented relatively early to fix the tracks, but it later became apparent that placing a railway bar above the track made it more effective.
This became commonplace, but iron caused further wear on the wooden wheels of the chariots.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first full iron rods were introduced.
Walking was the first mode of transportation, and humans began walking erect two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk straight in a constant manner.
Two-legged species have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the coastal anthropoid may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be active in reducing future suffering to some degree.
This is just like treating symptoms in many cases, however, if we don't want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem, and we have to end it.
It's pretty clear that the world has changed a lot because of humanity's scientific and technological progress, and the problems have become bigger because of humanity's increasing population and luxurious lifestyle.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Sir Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to the John Dunlap Press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlabs notebooks".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap Folds are the oldest surviving copies of the American Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many fossil scientists today believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have protective outer legs and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaur.
Virtually all computers in use today rely on processing encrypted information in binary form.
A binary number can only have one of two values, either 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers -- or bits, if we use computer terminology.
Intravenous toxicity may not show symptoms immediately. An immediate diagnosis cannot be made when symptoms such as vomiting, which are sufficiently common, appear.
An open container of medicines or toxic household chemicals may be the best indicator of indoor poisoning.
See the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "bugs" in its formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term is derived from ancient knowledge of bed bugs, which are insects that have adapted greatly to intruding on humans.
Both killer and bed bugs have long incubation periods, and they adapt to living in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease of the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their interest or that of their child to raise an infant.
These couples may choose to develop an adoption plan for their children.
In the adoption process, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through a scientific method.
It is not, however, unique in this respect, and experimentation is a test that can be used to refute one or more possible hypotheses; asking questions and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and, especially, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted on all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge declined among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are critically often dependent on the existence of self-cycling and their production through biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not just responses to external cyclical signals, have been documented in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-fluctuating system that will continue for periods of successive cycles even in the absence of external influences.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the key clues that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used parasites or viruses to insert their own DNA into the germs.
They did two experiments to either label the DNA of the pathogen using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are entase cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done on site include fishing, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about this species of monkey (organgatuangs) in Borneo.
People leave small towns in their cars every morning to go to work and meet other people on the road where they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone supports and is somehow connected to a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has displaced the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone is involved in the community and uses the transportation system.
Rarely in developed countries do you hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate these complaints, and why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic studies are difficult because you can't predict a driver's behavior with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus, traffic has a reasonable consistency, which can be expressed mathematically.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, relationships were established between three key characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operating road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are distinguished by their ability to bend their wings backward along the length of their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are the dragonfly and the fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right but many people thought otherwise; that the solar system revolved around the Earth including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel the earth move, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
20% of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the ancient Egyptian kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were not surpassed in size and technical excellence in construction by anything.
The ancient Egyptians in the modern kingdom were amazed by the remains of their ancestors, which were more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest and least populous independent state.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life used by most state employees, while Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All the people in Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the existence of basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, and all of these elements can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted in a relatively easy way using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything was made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they transform into new materials to form what we see.
A alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals. And of course there are metals like silver and gold, too.
You can also get alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could take up the space at the end of this sentence.
And so, the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing tools, the pencil has been replaced by less prestige and use.
People now write messages on computer screens, without having to use the game.
And one has only to wonder what the keyboard might become when something more recent comes along.
The fission bomb works on the basis that it collects energy to form a nucleus full of protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart rolling up a hill, the core breaks up again and some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to disintegrate with or without slight movement.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust.
The shell is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under Maria and thicker under the highlands.
There could be more lunar seas on the near side because the crust is less thick.
Content theories are about finding what excites or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that manifest themselves as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and the things in their environment that make them do or not do certain things.
Two common content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's second factor theory.
Generally, a behavior can appear when managers start to lead their former peers, one of which is trying to stay "like everyone else" (or others).
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibility, holding people accountable.
And on the other end, the individual becomes an unrecognizable person who feels that he/she has to change everything the team has been doing and having.
At the end of the day, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to conflicts between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same criteria of distinction as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than traditional team members as their teams may meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a real "hidden team" from Larson and LaVasto, 1989, p109 has been described as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member reports to the management team, the Invisible Team, where the Invisible Team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to build an educational organization in a time-consuming process? Innovation is one of the goals of implementing the concepts of institutional learning.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and excellence can be realized.
As a result, synergies within an organization to overcome obstacles can lead to the emergence of new innovative procedures that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), describes the continuity method as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides concrete evidence for theoretical approaches to knowledge exploration, thus shrinking the search area and making it much more precise.
The link between neurology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes in ways we never could before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research into AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become separate fields focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has been used to build various home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher may want to take her students to places where it is not possible to go by bus.
The technology enables the solution through virtual field visits. Students can view the museum artifacts, visit the aquarium or enjoy the beautiful art while sitting with their classmates.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to re-live a particular trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, and the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online as a record.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, having an audience changes that overall.
Since students are the most often critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogs also "force students to become smarter about the world around them". The need to feed public interest inspires students to be resourceful and helpful (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can "enable students to become more analytical and critical; and through active response to web materials, students can determine their positions in the context of others' writing as well as their own opinions on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital with a collection of art galleries and museums that highlight Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is at the southernmost tip, and to the north lies the beautiful, untapped nature home of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more highlight Ontario as what is considered Canadian by outsiders.
Large areas in the north are relatively sparsely populated and some almost uninhabited.
To make a comparison that will surprise many: the number of African Americans living in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island ever, and it's an independent continent when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent states, or attached to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam to the country, and it spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape route from Europe to India.
To the north, the area is bordered by the African coast, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Regardless of actual social status, women travelers must declare that they are married.
It's okay to wear a ring, but not the one that looks too expensive.
Women need to be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment and that it's common to spot them, grab them by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to hold your ground (cultural differences don't make it okay!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used the modern city of Casablanca as a strategic port called "Anfa" after it was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daro of Padua, and the Spanish traders named it Casablanca who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is easy to find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods throughout the old city, such as pots, pots, leather goods, shisha and all kinds of cheap goods, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo located in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the eruption of the Niragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Any visits outside of Goma should be sought to understand the ongoing fighting situation in North Kivu province, while Goma is reasonably safe.
The city is also a base for climbing the Niragongo volcano and some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking routes in Africa.
You can ride a Buda Buda (a motorcycle that acts as a taxi) to get around the city of Goma, and the usual price (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Besides being relatively inaccessible, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for faraway, foreign lands.
Timbuktu is now a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops for Henry Louis Gates on the PBS special series The Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has an Arab rather than African character.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park is 19,500 square kilometres in size and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the most attractive areas in South Africa, and its park is also considered the main national park of South Africa (South African National Parks).
There is a daily fee to maintain and enter the park, as in all national parks in South Africa.
It may be useful to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to enter a selected group of South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a place that many tourists consider their hometown.
The row of buildings that line the Hong Kong skyline resemble a glittering diagram that appears above the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is where the British colonists took it over as their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal belt of coastal dunes, stretching 80 kilometres (50 mi) in the coastal regions of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbanes has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest part within Indian territory is called Sundarbanes National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they contain some of the last evidence of the dense forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, almost a third of which is covered by water/marshes.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave the inner station between the areas (across the river) during the day although most especially those heading east from Jakarta/Bumthang leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because inter-district buses are often full, it is best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable and powerful Japanese coaster buses.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Barrow (Nu 150) and Bonaha (Nu 200).
The Ouyaboque River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Ouyaboque River to connect the cities of Ouyaboque in Brazil and San Jorge do Ouyaboque in French Guiana.
The towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long, and have two 3.50 metre wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to start operating at full capacity in September 2017, at the same time as the expected completion of Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaran√≠ were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay. The Guaran√≠ lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur√∫ and Payagu√°, who lived off hunting, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from a confrontation between Spanish invaders and indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial era.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournaments of the year are held in December, on the polo fields of Las Canitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley on the other side of the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and the US dollar is often.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted; check with owners in advance for accepted payment methods.
It is almost impossible to change Falkland currency outside the islands, so you must change money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is there when winter is in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; it is common for temperatures to exceed 30 ¬∞C in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make the air colder than the thermometer indicates.
The amount of rainfall remains almost constant throughout the year, with no defined "rain" and "dry" seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to human sight, wildlife is ultimately wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
And according to park officials, stay away from bears and wolves at least 100 yards per meter, and all other wildlife at 25 yards per meter!
As easy as they look to be hunted, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year for not staying at a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and considered endangered, so they should be given their own space.
Also, be careful that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly food and keep the camp clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia. The city is located on the island of Apollo and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans were also drowned.
During the Maoist struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the town resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Toupou Tamsis-Lilloy III.
Due to Oakland's location between two ports, there are many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, allowing for safe swimming, and most are still covered with botoqua trees.
Tamaki Road Beaches is located on the Whitimata Harbour, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded with a good variety of shops lining the beach.
The basic popular beer is known as "number one", it is not a compound drink, but a pleasant and refreshing drink.
French wines are numerous, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more widespread.
Local tap water is perfectly drinkable, but bottled water is easy to find, if you're scared.
For Australians, the idea of flat white is strange. The black mini-coffee is espresso, the cappuccino is a layer of cream (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian-standard. Fruit juices are excellent, though expensive.
Many trips to the reefs take place throughout the year, and reef injuries are rare for any of these reasons.
However, seek advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is present near beaches and estuaries from October to April 1770 N.E. It can sometimes be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away if they see one.
Saltwater crocodiles don't usually live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking assures the traveler that he will have a place to sleep once he reaches his destination.
Although you may find that other forms of accommodation, such as camping, can be booked through a travel agent, travel agents often have deals with certain hotels.
Travel agents have traditionally offered packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or even bundled packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests should be made through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on site as an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the events, you should get in early for a campsite near the music.
Remember that although the music on the main stages may have ended, some parts of the festival may continue to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, you should check the cabin location, as crossing the ice causes a very loud noise for the most affected people.
Cruise tours to St. Petersburg include a stay in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of efforts to increase the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special meals, drinks, and entertainment shows, to keep guests in a good mood, and keep them in the building.
Some places offer free alcohol, but drunkenness hinders judgment and teaches all good gamblers the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-zero temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were driving on smooth asphalt.
And during blizzards, a lot of snow can fall that's enough to stop you for a very short time.
Snowfall, snow winds, condensation or ice on car windows can cause limited vision.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are considered normal in many countries, and traffic is mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari trips are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The term safari is commonly used to refer to travel across the country to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment will allow for good viewing.
Lions, leopards and tigers are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a microscope.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle walk" or "walking tour") consists of walking long distances, either for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other venues around Japan.
After hosting the 1964 Olympics, Tokyo will become the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you book your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement is announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not return until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, with the typical cost around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer a sofa bed and a kitchenette to borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If there's no air conditioner, or you don't like wearing air conditioned socks, then you can try using an air dryer, if available.
Do not make the cloth too hot (which may shrink or burn in the worst case).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against certain threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, in others you need to boil it for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, so if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in bottles with a tight seal from a reputable company.
Travellers are likely to encounter pests of animals they are not familiar with in their home areas.
Pests can spoil food, cause discomfort, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infection.
The infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can infect or kill people by force, are not usually described as pests.
Free market shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in specific places.
Travellers heading to countries with sometimes high taxes can save a lot of money, especially when spending on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Vermont has the toughest driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Expressway, as it regularly passes through isolated forested terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are always steep slopes, narrow lanes and steep curves.
The declared speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict compliance with them is more important than otherwise.
And oddly enough, it seems that mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other areas along the way, for example the woods of Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to the pastries of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are popular, with apples baked in pastries year-round while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, nuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small, rich pastries, try what's called berliner, vancoucken or krabben, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Curry spring can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes, while in southern India and some other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines spread throughout Indonesia, given that there are 17,000 islands in Indonesia to distinguish them.
But when used without additional terms, the term tends to mean that the food originated from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a variety of simply spiced dishes, the main flavors preferred by Javanese are peanuts, pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various spices.
The saddles are the supports for the rider's feet hanging on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider but can have safety concerns because of the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in them.
If the rider falls off the horse but his foot remains stuck in the collar, he may be dragged away if the horse runs away.
First, most fantasy riders wear very tight, soft, high-heeled riding boots.
Second, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the fur to fall off the saddle when pulled back when the rider dismounts.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's first climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with a variety of large granite walls and rocks.
Climbers from around the world are constantly creating new routes between the potentially endless walls, with peaks offering spectacular views from above.
Snow sports on slopes, which include skiing and ice skating, are popular sports that involve sliding down a patch of snow-covered ground with skis or a skateboard mounted to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity during travel and has a large number of enthusiasts, who are sometimes known as "ski nomads", where they plan a complete vacation centered around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old. Cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.
The history of skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking: This activity is also called skiing in uninhabited areas, ski trips or long walks on ice.
It is associated with alpine skiing or mountain climbing, but does not usually involve ice skating or mountain climbing, as they are practiced in steep terrain and require tougher skates and longer boots.
Think of a ski trail as a similar trail to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you'll be able to cover somewhat longer distances than walking, but you'll rarely reach long-distance ski speeds without a heavy backpack and on well-equipped trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries means having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
However, the Schengen area operates somewhat as a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can cross the border in general without having to go through the passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you will not need to apply for visas for each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
Some tax agencies define artifacts as goods over a hundred years old, but there is no one-size-fits-all definition of what we consider artifacts.
To define geographic differences, the age limit may be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products may be known as antiques even though they are newer than similar goods mass-produced in the distant past.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for Sami people, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many other occupations.
Even traditionally, though, not all Sami people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived off fishing, hunting and the like, and used reindeer mostly as draft animals.
Many Sami people today work in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Sapmi.
Although the word "gypsy" is widely used, especially among non-Romani, it is considered an offensive word for its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Romani.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to seek advice from governments other than your own, but the advice of those governments is specifically for their citizens.
To give one example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations that are different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Travel warnings are just a summary of the political situation in a country.

Regional and extreme seasonal weather phenomena include: snow, ice and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to take into account any risk of extreme weather events in the places they visit as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be considered a war zone must have professional training.
An online search for "Hostile Environment Cycle" may lead to a local business address.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much greater detail and is usually through practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
There are many books and magazines on survival in the wild, while there are few publications on war zones.
Passengers who plan to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments vary in their willingness to issue passports without gender X or to issue updated documents to match their desired name or gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checkpoints became much more intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people should not expect to be screened before surgery while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Cloud currents are the flow back from waves that cut through the beach, often at coral reefs or something like that.
Because of the underwater terrain, the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a rapid current may form into the deep water there.
Most deaths result from exhaustion trying to swim upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you swim out of the current, swimming back will be no less easy than usual.
Try targeting somewhere where you're not going to be under the current again or, depending on your skills and whether someone notices you, waiting for rescue may be another option.
Homecoming trauma occurs faster than culture shock (shortening the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Sometimes, travelers who find it easy to adapt to a new culture have particular difficulty in re-adapting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When I first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The pyramidal sound and light display is one of the most fun things in the area for kids.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
You can hear the sound of tourists and vendors here all the time.

The scenes are shown on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, claim property from several countries, and have the most bases, with 16 active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometres north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Livingston Island and Deception, among other places, offer a spectacular natural harbor, the caldera, which is submerged by an active volcano.
Ellsworth Land is the southernmost region of the peninsula, bordered by the Blinghausen Sea.
The peninsular mountains here merge into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountain Range, which stretches 360 kilometers, and is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel range contains the highest mountains in the Antarctic continent, the Vinson Massif with a summit equivalent to 4892 m.
In remote locations, with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally no substitute for a mobile phone, as you must be outside in a clear line of sight with the satellite to make a phone call.
The service is frequently used by shipping, including picnic boats, as well as exploration missions that have remote data and voice needs.
There must be a local telephone service provider who can provide more information on how to contact this service.
Travel and learning are a more common choice for those planning a holiday.
It's especially popular among high school dropouts, because it allows them to spend a year before they go to college, without risking their education.

Finland is a great destination for boating. The Land of a Thousand Lakes also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
You don't need a yacht in the archipelago and the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, small boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is quite unique (for example in the Netherlands, the number from one to forty).
Most of the Baltic's outstanding tours are characterized by a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few full days on the way back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you are travelling on a coastal exploration cruise, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some tours feature the German city of Berlin in the brochures; as you can see from the map above, Berlin is not a place near the sea and the price does not include a visit to the city.
Flying can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never traveled before or have been in a painful accident.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not that different from the personal fears and other hated things that a lot of people have.
Understanding something about how planes work and what happens during flight may help some overcome the fear of the unknown or of not having control.
Shipping companies are paid well for delivering things quickly. Time is usually very important when it comes to business documents, goods and spare parts for urgent repairs.
The larger companies have their own planes, in some airlines, but there was a problem for other airlines and smaller companies.
If they ship things by air freight, it may take several days in some ways to clear customs.
Sending packages as checked baggage was the only way to get them quickly, but airline internal regulations don't allow unattended baggage, so it's your turn at this point.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to allocate a large sum of money to get this privilege (or better yet, to hire your company to do it).
However, this does not come cheap: as a strict rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rent for business, and 11 times that for first class!
In general, it is pointless to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that there is a specific key group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they are held accountable accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi≈üinƒÉu. The local language is Romanian but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflict.
In 1994 this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.

The 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In addition, from the north you can visit the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous Marian apparitions site.
Please remember that you are basically at the site of a mass grave, and it's also a site of almost infinite meaning to a huge portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive from those who survived their time here, and many other people who had loved ones killed or worked to their death there, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity and respect it deserves.
Do not distort the site by putting signs or graffiti on the walls of buildings.

The rough Parisian exterior parts will evaporate quickly if you show some basic courtesies.
The Pleich Lake National Park is mostly covered with dense forests of pine, fir and fir trees, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It has a large and diverse range of plant communities, due to the range of local climates, different soil types, and varying elevation levels.
The area is also home to a very diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare species of animals can be found there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, swan, wildcat, cockroach, among many other more common species.
While visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear skirts that cover their knees and also their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide a scarf for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own scarf, especially the brightly colored ones, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear pants that cover both knees.
You can also borrow these from the store at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Therefore, any entry permit to the back country on any date starting in May becomes available on 1 January.
Olive oil bread is a popular example of a simple dinner, especially during the summer: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available spices such as cheese, tuna, etc.

However, people who know little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to Spanish that it does not require a separate study.
Unmodern observatories are usually unusable today, and remain as museums or educational sites.
While light pollution was not at its peak one of their major problems as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on college campuses and are easier to access than modern buildings.
Most modern research telescopes are massive installations in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing - known as hanami - has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the most popular.
In Japan, the emperor held the first cherry blossom parties exclusively for himself and other members of the noble class around the imperial court.

Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays, celebrated as the birth of Christ.
Non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have also adopted many traditions surrounding holidays.
There's a tradition of staying up all night on Easter to see the sunrise.
This tradition can certainly be interpreted from a Christian theological perspective, but there is a possibility that it was a religious ritual of spring and fertility before the Christian era.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter Eve prayer on Saturday during Easter weekend, and the gatherings often begin to celebrate the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands either swam, flew or floated.

Since the arrival of humans to the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you decide to visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience the Arctic night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.

Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Suits are traditional work clothes, and coworkers call each other by their family names or by job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing teamwork rather than individual achievement.
