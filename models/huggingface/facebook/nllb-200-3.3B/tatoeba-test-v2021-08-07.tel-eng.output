A cat came out from under the desk.
Ah! How beautiful is the Taj Mahal!
How peaceful this temple is!
How's the stomach?
Emmitty, is this real?
Are you okay?
Are you all right?
Are you mad?
Are you willing to do this?
Are you still afraid of what might happen?
As far as I know, he is not married.
How long do I have to go to the station?
Oh, my God!
Bananas are delicious.
Bring the tea now!
Bring the tea.
Brush your teeth daily
Can I make a call ?
Did you see it?
Can you tell me where the nearest bus stop is?
The children love cake.
Come, I'll give you some too
Of course
Did all of this really happen?
Did you do your homework yesterday?
Don't hesitate to ask me for help.
Don't interfere with my work.
Is there anything else to say?
Do you know why he is so angry ?
Do you live around here?
Will you break the staff before the morning?
Give this book to Rama.
Give it to Ram.
Go there tomorrow!
Go there.

Is Lata from school?
Did you get the letter?
Is the red rose blooming?
Is the rose full?
Did you do your homework?
Have you done your homework?
Have you ever been to Paris?
Have you ever had a heart attack?
Have you done your homework?
Have you eaten?
He didn't keep his word.
He dressed as a woman.
He makes three times as much as I do.
He has two pencils. One is long and the other is short.
He put
He is a Ram.
He is teaching the children Spanish
Help came too late
He made her a bookshelf.
The arms and legs are long
He's our guy
He took revenge.
He touched me.
Not only a great game, but also a good doctor.
And he shall wash his hands in the blood of the swine ,
Shall we go out to eat tonight ?
How are you coming?
How are you?
How are you?
How did you put this doll in?
How many mangoes do you want?
How many mangoes do you want?
Are you okay?
How tall is she?
Have you finished the work I asked you to do?
I started talking
I can't keep you here any longer.
I don't like coffee.
I make mistakes too
I do not agree
I don't have time to talk right now.
I don't know where they are.
I don't know who won.
I don't need anything.
I don't speak Japanese.
I don't trust him
I don't want to talk to you.
I drank coffee.
I heard the bell ringing
I heard you were not well.
I know you'll say no.
I'll be very careful.
I'll leave it for this one.
I'll start swimming very soon.
I'll get off at the next stop.
I'm hungry again.
I am learning the Burmese language.
I'm not allowed to do that here.
I'm too old to make my own decisions.
I'm really sorry about last night.
I know he'll come
I usually do it.
I've never seen him
I ran home.
I recognized you as my brother.
Are you okay?
I should have been able to do it myself.
Amity! Is this true?
Is there good water?
Is the work done?
Is it Chinese or Japanese? Is it Korean?
I suggest you do it.
Did you do your homework?
Did you do your homework?
It's not that simple.
I guess it's not useful.
I had to learn to speak English fluently.
The whole afternoon or longer
They have no use for it.
It's time to leave for school, isn't it?
It's not your fault.
It's worth a lot.
It is clear that there is no other way.
It's not my fault.
I made a mistake, even though I didn't mean to.
I've never been to Japan.
It hit me.
I wouldn't go there today if I were you.
Two birds for one man
Lalita has invited me to the wedding.
Lalita called.
Let him stay there.
Let's take that chance.
Mary bought a handbag with a scarf.
Mary bought a new dress for the party.
Mary would have lied to you, but she didn't.
Tom's words were painful to Mary.
Mary's boyfriend threatened to leave her.
Mike comes to dinner
Please give me some more coffee.
My bag is nowhere to be found.
My computer is expensive.
My father is no longer at home
My father would fall asleep looking at the telescope.
My head hurts.
Our sister is a tennis-crazy girl.
They did not come.
You're not the only one to blame.
Is that true?
That! Are you telling the truth?
What a miracle!
I'm going to die!
The king fell down the stairs!
The elderly walk more slowly
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Only animal products contain fat.
Beyond the Sight, Beyond the Mind
People believe that there is a God.
Rama came to the temple.
Ram is here.
Ram came to the party.
It's the evening reading.
It is evening reading.
It's reading.
He asked me how many languages I speak.
She breathed in the cold air.
She had no children.
The woman refuses to say more.
She is sitting on the table.
The wind scared the cat .
She's not a doctor.
He is no longer at home.
She has been teaching music for thirty years
He was on his way to school.
She was about to turn white with fear
Show me where it hurts.
Sita was very impressed.
Sita smiled.
Sitting all day is not good for you
Some dogs are still alive.
Tell me about your daily life.
Thank you for greeting me.
That boy was a little monster.
That was a party.
It's been very interesting.
It's not that easy, you know.
Sin has cried out loud.
The sin has wept.
The baby cries for milk
The day is not yet over.
The movie is about to begin.
Shabash! The doll is good!
There are islands in the sea.
There is no reason to be afraid.
The Bible says that God "will wipe out every tear from their eyes".
These pencils are the same color.
These socks don't stretch when you wash them.
Close to the station
The work is almost finished.
They are animals.
They sing a song
That is a very stupid question.
This is me eating a banana.
It's not a sentence.
It hurt me so much.
This plant has some burnt leaves.
Tom's girlfriend threatened to leave him.
Tom washed his hands thoroughly.
He washed his glasses in hot soap water and put them on the table.
Tom was very scared.
Is it really that bad?
The Bible says that "the one who is having an affair with a man is already asleep".
We made it happen.
We don't understand French.
We had not slept for days.
Shabash, you have done a great job with this doll.
We need money to do what we want to do.
We must employ only those who are trustworthy
We played basketball yesterday.
We have to get rid of him.
We want to hear
What are you doing Tom tomorrow?
What are you saying?
What did you talk about?
What did you talk about?
What more do I have to lose?
What the game says is meaningless.
How much is the book?
What time is it?
Amity, is this true?
What's in the box?
What time is it?
What is your room number ?
What time is it?
What will you take?
When did you stop smoking?
When will Sita leave Aelur?
When will Mammy come from Vijayawada?
When will you come back?
You'll understand when you're my dad
Where did you put my book?
Where is Mary?
Where is your boy?
Where words cannot speak, music speaks.
Which color do you like, blue or purple?
What is your pen ?
Who are we?
Why aren't you ready?
Why aren't you asleep yet?
Why can't giraffes sing?
Why did you call me?
Why did you lie to her?
She opened the door while her heart was pounding
What is the difference?
You can do it.
Is that so?
You are fat.
You can eat your lunch in this room.
You don't have to be ashamed.
You must come at once.
You can go swimming or fishing.
You need to speak up.
Stay where you are
You seem very happy.
You came early.
