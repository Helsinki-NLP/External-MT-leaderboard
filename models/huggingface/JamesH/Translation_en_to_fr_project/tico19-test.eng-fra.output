Increased cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends in European Union/European Economic Area countries and the UK, confirming that, while at different stages depending on country, the pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience from Italy, countries should increase their preparedness for a surge of COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare, and particularly intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown aetiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a novel coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Currently, about 80% of individuals with COVID-19 have mild disease, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In about 14% cases, COVID-19 becomes a more severe disease requiring hospitalisation and the remaining 6% cases experience critical illness requiring intensive care.
The death rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assess the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and compare them to that of Hubei Province, China.
The current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK compares with that in Italy during 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread further and the pandemic in the rest of the world is currently followed by China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In 5 March issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and others reported on the first European confirmed COVID-19 cases according to the WHO case definition.
In EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, whereby between 31 December 2019 and that date included, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths have been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Tracking cumulative number and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the reported COVID-19 case counts in each country, obtained from official sources such as the country’s Health Minister, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK, and compare them to that in Italy.
As a proxy of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases, taking account of the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the 1 January–15 March 2020 period.
The cumulative number of notified cases of each country as at 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m compared with that of Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and UK
The trends in the 14-day truncated cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally followed that of Hubei Province (China).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 started to increase around 21 February and then sharply increased around 28 February 2020.
This was mostly driven by the rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but all EU/EEA countries and UK showed similar trends of cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (supplementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases, in EU/EEA countries and UK compared with that in Italy for the 31 January–15 March 2020 period.
It highlights that, as at 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 EU/EEA countries and UK have already reported cases similar to Italy 3 weeks prior or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in EU/EEA and UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at comparable speed in all countries.
This is despite different countries, different public health responses, and possibly different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including catch-up testing.
Early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which about 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care and media sources reported that the capacity of the hospitals and intensive care units in these regions was already exceeded.
Currently, data on admission of COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an intensive care unit are available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% cases (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and number of deaths.
A study performed in 2010–11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive and intermediate care beds per 100,000 population in 2010–11).
Healthcare capacity saturation scenarios, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of hospitalised COVID-19 cases associated with a >90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have been clustered in several regions in EU/EEA countries and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve a defined regional catchment population, information about cases and intensive care beds should be made available at the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level.
The experience from Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in EU/EEA and UK.
They should thus prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and a increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring healthcare, and particularly intensive care, such as the one in the affected regions of Italy.
As pointed out in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, with a shift from containment to mitigation approach, as the anticipated rapid increase in cases may not provide enough time to comprehend, accept and adapt their response if not implemented ahead of time.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
The short window of opportunity is available during which countries have the possibility to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health.
Without this, other EU/EEA countries will face a surge of patients that require intensive care within the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already killed over 3,000 people and infected over 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in human disaster.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and death than SARS but is much more transmissive and affects more elderly individuals than younger individuals and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging disease, this article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing research subject.
The basics about epidemiology, etiology, virusology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this review will help in the understanding and eradication of the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unprecedented and unforgettable memory to all Chinese who have been asked to stay in the house for all the holiday and for many weeks after due to the outbreak of a novel viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and the associated disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to near 50 other countries worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in over 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and over 3,000 patients who die.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “public enemy number 1” and potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, over 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
This review aims to summarize the research progress in the new and rapidly developing subject area.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another CoV-caused disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
The following sections will discuss what we have learned about prevention and prognosis of the disease as well some remaining urgent questions.
CoVs have been traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century we have encountered highly pathogenic human CoVs two times, i.e. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many countries with severe morbidity and death.
The current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, clusters of unknown pneumonia were first reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the sequence of the CoV was released.
On January 15, 2020 the first fatal case from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic rapidly spreads to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, Wuhan city was locked down with all public transport stopped.
The first clinical study on the disease reported that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting site of the infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
The disease has already spread throughout China and near 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
As the situation is rapidly evolving, the final scope and severity of the outbreak remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study on 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a more updated illustration of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly at the age of 30-65.
Around half of the infected individuals were over 50 years old, very few were under 20, and only 14 infected individuals were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 expanded in clusters mainly in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9 days) from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2 days).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people started to increase exponentially before 23 Jan. 2020, matching the time of mass transport before the Spring Festival in China.
The death of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted death of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a single strand of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, i.e. alpha, beta, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelopes of glycoproteins and nucleoplasmic proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequenced samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrathin sections of human airway epithelium.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a novel short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not have any functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of full-length human ACE2 at 2.9 Å resolution in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
The complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, providing evidence for CoV recognition and infection.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and intermediate host
It has been known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civet cats and camels, respectively.
Through phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unclear, and the transmission route is yet to be defined.
They proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans which involves homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-snouted, ant-eating mammals often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are the potential intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, 1% difference spread all over two genomes is still a big difference, and concrete evidence is needed (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 50%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
The virus is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population generally lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and therefore is susceptible to the novel virus.
Currently, no detailed study has been reported regarding the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Then we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognised by the host innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus stimulates the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) which block the virus spreading and accelerate macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape from immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in the defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
T helper cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by causing apoptosis of T cells.
Human immune system including complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also essential in combating viral infection.
Examples of antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
The other side of the immune system produces a large number of free radicals locally that can cause severe damage to lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, featured by clustering onset, is more likely to affect elderly people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to large numbers of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised, they have higher chances of being infected than others.
The mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
More recent studies, as described above, indicate that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2 days) based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is important for health authorities to adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to, or infected by the virus are usually quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine time be extended to 24 days?
fever is often the major and initial symptom of COVID-19, which can be accompanied by no symptom or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle ache, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients reported dyspnea and/or hypoxia one week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases patients quickly progressed to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary imaging abnormalities, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
The percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 2% for diarrhoea.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family cluster and a cluster caused by transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and dyspnea (55%).
However, 80% of them required ventilation support, much more than COVID-19 patients and consistent with the higher lethality of MERS than of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%).
By February 14, the death rate of COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed cases reached 66,576 globally.
Comparably, the death of SARS by November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of 2,494 confirmed cases.
The previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged from 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding symptoms, mortality, and R0 is presented in Table Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less lethal than the latter two.
The challenge is much more difficult to control the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clustered onset often occurs in the same family or from the same group or vehicle such as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the past two weeks before the onset.
However, people can carry the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and cured patients discharged from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends an alert to increase quarantine time.
Patients have normal or reduced number of peripheral blood cells (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
Examples include lymphopenia with white blood cell count <4×109/L including lymphocyte count <1×109/L, and elevated aspartate aminotransferase levels and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were increased in some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product present in blood, was elevated, and lymphocyte count gradually declined.
Chronic chest radiography abnormalities are found in most COVID-19 patients and are characterised by bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Poor function of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and heightening the risk of lung collapse.
The worst chest radiographic findings often parallel the most severe extent of the disease.
The first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the destruction of pneumococci, hyaline membranes, and interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, consistent with the pathological pathology of viral infection and ARDS, and similar to SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the major criteria for diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false-negative rate, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations started to be used for diagnosis (which no longer relies on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with diagnosis of SARS.
The combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
The Feng Zhang group describes a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically enhance the sensitivity and convenience if verified in clinical samples.
Because of the lack of experience with the novel CoV, physicians can mainly provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while trying a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed for other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
This therapy includes current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from recovered patients was proposed to be used for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs in the beginning and may also affect other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the major threat to patients and major cause of death.
The respiratory support is critical to reduce symptoms and save lives.
severe respiratory symptoms require support by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening cardiac or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infection and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that a cytokine storm results from an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response featured by release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6 and MCP-1.
This cytokine stimulates immune cells to release a large number of radicals, which are the major cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunsuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine storm include modulation of T cell-directed immune response; blockade of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; suppressor of cytokine signaling 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressants, were widely used in SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids were not beneficial to severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they may cause severe side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which dramatically affects the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low to moderate doses have been recommended to be used prudently for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, has been found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
However, remdesivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single stranded RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct two trials on SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, and the results are highly anticipated.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Hepatitis, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combined therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be monitored carefully.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who recover from a contagious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from catching the disease has a long history.
In recovered patients, relatively high levels of antibodies against the pathogen are often found in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects and they recognise unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from blood of a group of recovering patients from COVID-19 and injected into 10 serious patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and viral load and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are needed to propose the method for large scale use before specific therapies are yet developed.
In addition, considering the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be considered.
Antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is potentially life-threatening.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low, and the plasma is large to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies rapidly enough to fight a global epidemic.
The more critical and practical way to isolate B cells from recovered patients is to identify the genetic codes encoding effective antibodies or screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
This way we can easily scale up the production of the antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects largely depend on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain unknown or are vague as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
Examples of Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for COVID-19 treatment.
highest cure rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were observed in several China provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in only approximately 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (3%).
However, this is a rough comparison as many other factors such as the number and severity of the patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and coworkers published a study comparing western medicine (WM) treatment alone with combined treatment of WM and TCM.
The time needed for body temperature recovery, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization was remarkably shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM only group.
Most impressively, symptomatic worsening (from light to severe) was remarkably lower in the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (4.5% versus 46.2%) and death was lower in the WM+TCM group than for the WM only group (8% versus 39.9%).
The efficacy and safety of TCM still remain await more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centers.
It would also be intriguing to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or combinations if possible.
Symptoms or confirmed cases of COVID-19 mostly experience great fear of the highly infectious and even fatal disease, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Additional symptoms of the infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough as well adverse effects of the treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric morbidities included persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, depression, psychotic symptoms, and even suicidality was reported.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people more anxious and guilty about the effects of the spread, quarantine, and stigma on their family and friends.
The mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected individuals, and people in close contact with them as well as the general public who is in need.
The psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, regular and accurate updates about the outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each other.
Effective vaccines are essential for interrupting the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected humans to susceptible host and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of emerging virus epidemics.
efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to produce long-term and potent neutralizing antibodies and/or protector immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live-attenuated vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in elderly individuals and lethal-challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection is yet to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and clusters of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistent zoonotic source in endemic areas.
MERS vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS by using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and critical task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulty because of the long period of time (average 18 months) needed for vaccine development and the dynamic variation of CoVs.
As a novel disease, COVID-19 has just started manifesting its full clinical course throughout thousands of patients.
Most cases of patients recover gradually without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and death in patients with severe cases.
The development of a disease prognosis model is essential for health-care agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-constrained areas.
Based on clinical studies reported thus far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
Epidemic cases of COVID-19 mainly occurred at the age 30-65 with 47.7% of those patients over 50 in a study of 8,866 cases as described above.
They were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were significantly older than those who did not (median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a prognostic factor for outcome of COVID-19 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Chronic complications and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the main cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is worth noting that age and underlying disease are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Laboratory findings: C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and ultimate recovery.
CRP level to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and creatine kinase (CK) may also predict the outcome.
This enzyme is widely distributed in multiple organs, especially heart and liver, and is release during tissue damage.
The traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction are heart or liver dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for the prediction of outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: As described above, steroids are commonly used as an adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors died from avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
If needed, steroids should be used at low doses and for short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients have suffered a huge stress as they often went through long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty and saw the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is essential to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological features from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the upper respiratory tract and causes mild or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause common colds.
Infected patients at the early phase or incubation period can produce a large amount of virus during daily activities, which causes great difficulty in control of the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when the patients are severely ill, while most transmission occurred at the early phase.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are currently underway in China, including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continuous quarantine of almost the whole population in order to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have been dramatically affecting the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the downswing phase will last for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts are not that optimistic.
Paul Hunter, and others estimate that COVID-19, which seems substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, and others established a model to predict the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, which could become a cyclical episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signs have occurred in China with declining number of new cases, suggesting the current strategies may have worked.
Ebola was originally expected to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has finally been cured.
It is possible, similar to SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in infectiousness and eventually die or become a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
The comparison of the epidemic of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmittable through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in feces, which raises a new possibility of feces-to-mouth transmission.
The recent study on 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases may be caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with other prior diseases and 40 health care providers.
The highest safety measures should be used to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgery masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical face masks prevent liquid droplets from a potentially infected individual from traveling through air or sticking to surfaces of materials, where they may be passed on to others.
However, only N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions penetrating completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both are about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even five surgical masks stacked together, health-care providers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition, health care providers should wear isolation gowns to reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual through the eyes.
In January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask.
Health-care providers should also wear transparent face shields or goggles while working with patients.
In affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands more often than usual, try to stay indoors for self-quarantine and limit contact with potentially infected individuals.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
This is effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 came as a new virus to human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on her deep memory of the 2003 SARS outbreak in 2003
However, not until 19 January 2020 the Director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control told the citizens that the novel virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductivity from human to human and that it is not a problem to prevent and contain the disease.
This message remarkably calmed the public, especially when the country prepared for the Spring Festival, and the critical time to contain the disease at its minimal scale in Wuhan was missed.
The disease control agencies in China may take this hard lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
These agencies should be more careful in making public announcements as every word can change people's attitude and decisions, and (4) more frequently issue targeted and effective drills to increase public awareness about epidemic diseases and to test and improve the response system of the society.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus started in December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread all over China and near 50 other countries globally at this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and symptoms are similar to COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has created a sense of SARS recurring.
However, there are some remarkable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are vital for containing the epidemic and treating the patients.
COVID-19 affects more elderly individuals than youth and more men than women, and the severity and death rate are also higher in elderly individual than in youth.
SARS has higher mortality than COVID-19 (9.09% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are symptomless, whereas SARS patients do so usually when they are severely ill, which causes much higher difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS patients.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and broader than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assay for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
In other cases, cured patients can be positive for the virus again.
This finding dramatically increases the risk of virus spreading.
Given such rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several critical issues remain to be resolved:
How did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species to transmit the virus from the original host, which are bats, to humans?
Without knowing answers to #1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut the transmission, and the outbreak can relapse anytime.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assays have already demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the airway and cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions we cannot achieve fast and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus genetically evolving during human transmission?
Does it become a pandemic, die like SARS or relapse periodically like flu?
It is essential but may take time to search for answers to above and many other questions.
However, with what cost it may require, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and bring our life back to normal.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Genetic mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their host, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) caused mild illness, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shifted the coin to reveal how devastating and life-threatening an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has thrown CoVs into thespotlight again and surprised us with its high transmission but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origin of HCoVs would be helpful.
Most HCoVs originated from bats where they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal host hosts has direct consequences in human disease prevention.
Investigation of CoV-host interactions in animals may also provide important insight on CoV pathogenesis in humans.
The present review includes an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, focusing on the history of discovery, zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
Importantly, we compare and contrast the different HCoVs from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current CoV disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switches and the consequences of virus evolution on disease severity are also reviewed.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of enveloped, positive-sensed, single stranded RNA viruses.
The most common viruses harbouring the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases in RNA viruses are called “CoVs” because of their crown-like morphology under electron microscopy.
Structurally, CoVs have non-segmented genomes that share similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome has two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are furtherprocessed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for the structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membranes (M) and nucleoplasm (N).
A number of lineage-specific accessory proteins are also encoded by different lines of CoVs.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which the beta-CoV genera contain most HCoVs and is divided into four lineages (A, B and C).
phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the main reservoir of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have constantly crossed species barriers and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in relatively more patients with higher chances of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from nasal discharge of common cold patients in mid 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was acquired through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept of infection with HCoVs is generally harmless until the outbreak of SARS.
The SARS outbreak occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating outbreaks in current history, killing over 8,000 people with a crude case fatality of about 10%.
The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 9,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence support an evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but show great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific and social challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework to understand the natural history, drive and restrict factors of species jumping.
This may also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifying animal host(s), with important implications in preventing future spillover.
In this review we present a review of the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
Specifically, we highlight and discuss the common theme that parental viruses of HCoVs are typically non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
The trend of HCoV evolution is also reviewed, where increasing transmission often leads to decrease in pathogenicity.
The outbreak outbreak is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal discharge of patients with common cold, different CoVs were isolated in different infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig and cat.
In recent years, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A short summary of the history of HCoV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was later adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Infected with HCoV-229E patients presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough seen in 10~20% cases.
In 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in brains of suckling mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection seem to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomaticly different from infection with other respiratory tract pathogens such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be mostly transmitted during winter in temperate climates.
The incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by an approximately 2-week illness.
Human volunteer studies indicate that healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed mild common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients reported severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as “atypical pneumonia”, was the first well documented HCoV-caused pandemic in human history and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province of China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across many countries and continents.
Following the super-spreaders, each case could produce about two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4–7 days and peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of illness.
Infected patients with SARS-CoV initially present with myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, deranged liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increase of macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract, multiple organs including gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney can also be infected in severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open lung biopsy of a relative of the index patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from Netherlands during late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory illnesses.
Presentation of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Other independent studies describe the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen from an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in Netherlands, it is actually distributed globally.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and peak incidence occurs during early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive larynitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Following community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have been well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, but accidents occur for unknown reasons as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which recently caused severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
When these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less pathogenic or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional secondary spreads to close contact have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Other outbreaks occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical manifestations are similar to SARS, characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Similar to SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which is still uncommon for MERS among HCoV-caused diseases.
More than 30% of patients present with gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses to humans.
During middle late December 2019, clusters of pneumonia patients retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and also named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude case fatality of 3.4%.
The death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2%, while the one outside of it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they cluster into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread around the world.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great interest.
First, incubation period and course of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of symptoms of COVID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits features commonly seen in community-acquired HCoVs, including nonspecific, mild or even no symptoms.
The small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be seen in SARS-CoV infection, but the ratio is a bit lower.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
In other words, it is still unknown if the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human passages as in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
However, whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in some circumstances remains to be clarified by future studies.
It is also of particular interest to see if SARS-CoV-2 might exhibit seasonality as in community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after passages in humans will be important to the ultimate outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs causing mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
The other perspective might also be that humans have been well adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could survive ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause severe diseases in humans and humans who develop severe HCoV diseases have been eliminated.
Then, HCoVs must replicate in humans to sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
The longer the outbreak remains and the more people it infects, the greater chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission in humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
The four community-acquired CoVs circulate in human populations, causing common cold in immunocompetent subjects.
This virus does not require animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted to humans well and human transmission cannot be sustained.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the chance to spill over to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate and amplifying host.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible like community-acquired HCoVs, at least for the time being.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still to be seen whether it will adapt fully to humans and circulate within humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing animal origin of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifying hosts of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it harbours a closely related ancestor with high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Likewise, a reservoir host harbour HCoV continuously and for long term.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and is the natural host of HCoV or its parental virus.
In contrast, if the HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host before or around its introduction to humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is often pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying host by allowing the virus to replicate and then transmit it to humans to increase human infection.
An HCoV can undergo a dead-end infection if it cannot survive its transmission within the intermediate host.
On contrary, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemic territory.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data reveal retrospectively that the index case of SARS had a contact history with game animals.
Following seroprevalence investigations indicate that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared with that of the general population.
MASKed palm civets (Paguma larvata) and a racoon dog in live animal markets were first identified to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no further SARS was reported after killing all civets in the market.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets from wild or farms without exposure to live animal markets were largely negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may only serve as the intermediate amplifying host but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
However, since 80% of different animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these appear to be dead-end hosts of SARS-CoV.
Following search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3, which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
This bat is positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
The foundation for this new concept is that bats host emerging human pathogens.
SARS-like CoVs have also been identified from bats, but no except one designated WIV1 can be isolated as live virus.
Human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from fecal sample of bats was reported to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as receptors for cell entry.
In a very interesting way, serum of convalescent SARS patients was capable of neutralizing WIV1.
The most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats is WIV1, sharing 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Because of the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis clusters MERS-CoV to the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Both HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically close to counterparts in bat beta-CoVs identified in Europe and Africa.
Up to now no live MERS-CoV is found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat CoV-HKU25 share only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
The reservoir of MERS-CoV is not immediately a reservoir of MERS-CoV.
The other hand, studies in Middle East have reported that dromedary camels are seropositive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to camels of Middle East origin in several African countries.
MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further evidence that camels are the only reservoir of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that generally mild symptoms but massive virus shedding was observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
Infected camels shed viruses not only through respiratory route but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route for virus shed from bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels prior to symptom onset, possibly ascribed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognized animal species that carry MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 has 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat CoV RaTG13 isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too great to assign parental relationship.
The latter means that bats may not be the immediate reservoir host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost identical bat CoVs are found in future.
Possibly, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife sold and killed at Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, suggesting a possible animal-to-human transmission event.
Recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbour ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The novel pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identity at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree are divided into two sub-lineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has more similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, albeit with higher degree of sequence homology genome-wide.
The previous study on diseased pangolins also reported the detection of viral contigs from lung samples, which turned out to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different assembling methods and manual curation to produce a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal host of SARS-CoV-2.
However, currently no evidence for a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 is available due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals are still unknown.
While the highest sequence homology has been found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectivity-mediated convergent evolution.
Counter-proposal is for recombination of a pangolin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the 3rd wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Beyond the highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
Genetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV termed ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in North American tricolored bat displayed close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
The other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat CoV, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camelids have been suspected as its intermediate host.
For clarity, the current knowledge on animal origins of known HCoVs is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission of HCoVs in the history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
between them there is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans but not alpacas may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, whereas alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been found in feral animals.
The possibility of acquiring HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans is unavoidable.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses including rabies virus, Ebola virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats might transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
However, whereas bat alpha-CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedary camels may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known at its initial identification and has also been strengthened by further findings.
It is clear that bats provide a rich pool of virus species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely packed colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all favourable conditions for bats to be an ideal 'virus spreader'.
However, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for years.
It is well adapted to these camels that have changed from an intermediate host to a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
The sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain dead-end host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins if any, in transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
Particularly, pangolin beta-CoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be dead end host for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS CoV-2 from animals to humans are being investigated or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share the ecological niche with bats through butchering or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be an intermediate host to a newly introduced SARS-CoV-2-related virus.
Humans contract the virus through butchering and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is warranted.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still on.
In addition, different animal host types also play a major role in facilitating CoVs to cross species barriers.
First of all, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
In contrast to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of CoVs are “moderate to high” with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitution per year per site 2 depending on the phase of CoV adaptation to novel host.
CoVs have a proof-reading exoribonuclease, depletion of which results in a remarkably high degree of mutability and almost invisible illness.
Similarly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV replication through inhibition of this exoribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, mutation rates of CoVs are about a million times higher than those of their host.
Additionally, mutation rate is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
While SARS-CoV with high mutation rate is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
Possibly, it has already been adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
The theory is that genetic drift would render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective quickly.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exhibits extra plasticity in genome modification for mutation and recombination, which increases the probability of co-evolution when the conditions become appropriate.
This is supported by the copious open reading frames and protein functions encoded at the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently switch templates during RNA replication through a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host that serves as the mixing vessel, strand switching occurs frequently during CoV RNA transcription.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs could recombine to produce new CoVs.
Genetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Herein, recombination of SARS-CoV is considered as a common example, which also shows positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on the comparing analysis of human and civet SARS-CoV isolates, SARS-CoV is thought to adapt rapidly to different host hosts, particularly with mutations at the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cellular receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is in 318th to 510th amino acids on the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its coreceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is capable of recognising ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, allowing interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the RBD and 4 of them are located in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV liver strain has K479N and S487T mutations, which may increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions may be critical to human viral adaption.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein implicates that the binding affinity of its S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, a cryo-EM study shows a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity of this binding than that between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other coreceptor might be required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Incidentally, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with different part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also account for successful adaptation of these CoVs in humans after interspecies transmission from their animal host.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host dependency and restriction factors.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and rodents may be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs must avoid host dependency factors and subvert host restriction factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction remain to be identified and characterised.
An unbiased genome-wide screening of host dependency and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the state-of-the-art technology of CRISPR might be fruitful.
New HCoVs: back to ground zero
The diversity of bat CoVs provides ample opportunities for the emergence of novel HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination drive HCoV evolution and are two important steps in this process.
However, the acquisition or loss of novel protein-coding genes has the potential to radically change viral phenotypes.
ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptations, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses reported to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A 29-nucleotide depletion characteristic of SARS-CoVs has been found in strains isolated at the beginning of human epidemic.
This deletion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the switch of host hosts.
Additionally, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination locations were also identified in the nsp9, most of nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, MERS-CoV experienced recombination events between different lineages in Saudi Arabia.
Beyond SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, which recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be advised that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from relieving viruses from selection pressures exerted by the host immune system.
The example of these effects is the loss of a full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, caused by two-nucleotide deletion.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bat and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, the alpaca alpha-CoV displays a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frameshift.
Next, the evolution of novel HCoVs is also driven by the selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoVs, which indicate the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats are well adapted to CoVs anatomically and physiologically.
Examples of defects in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathological damage caused by CoVs.
Additionally, natural killer cell activity in bats is reduced due to upregulation of inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low expression level of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules.
Moreover, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced from high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease proofreading, thus providing the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains may also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquired novel proteins or protein features for host adaptation.
It is not by chance that three novel HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or mild symptoms in their reservoir host such as bats and camels.
They replicate robustly without eliciting a strong host immune response.
Here lies the secrets of why carriers are seen and what causes the severe human infection.
The severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of immune response and the cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe lung damage is.
In contrast, in symptomatic carriers, the immune response has been de-coupled from CoV replication.
The same strategy of delinking the immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
The administration of type I interferon at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflammasome activation in bats is defective.
This might be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there is also a bat-CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civets and other animals in the market have been found to harbour viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs very closely homologous to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may serve as intermediate host or pangolin beta-CoVs could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is deliberately or accidentally produced.
CoVs have returned to the limelight due to recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Pervasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have bat origin and are transmitted to humans via intermediate host.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originates from human and civet contact in the market, closing wet markets and killing civets therein could have effectively prevented SARS epidemic.
Similarly, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, especially because of the discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, how and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals remain to be clarified in future investigations.
However, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
The camels are an important tool for transport as well as a main source of meat, milk and wool products for the local people.
Their distribution is widespread across the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as was done in wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
As we do not eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in wild.
Specially, bat CoVs with zoonotic potential are so diverse.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, resulting in emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or deadly in humans in future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the outbreaks of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be in place.
In fact, many viruses have been present on the planet for a long time.
The reservoir is kept in its natural reservoirs until there is a chance for spillover.
Although bats have many features that favour virus spreading, humans can avoid contact with bats and other wild species if they are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance in mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural host, which will be helpful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
The most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to stay away from the ecology of the natural reservoirs of the zoonotic viruses.
Some pieces in the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it will be interested to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play more direct role in human transmission, how humans get into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal act as the true intermediate host, how it interacts with the different species including humans, bats and pangolins must be clarified.
Finally, since many mammals including domestic animals may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be conducted.
If it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses are expected to be identified in its natural host in future.
Continued investigations in this area will reveal the evolutionary pathways of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated diagnostic criteria of COVID-19 “suspected case” and “confirmed case” is necessary.
The team published a rapid advice guideline for diagnosis and treatment of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, and this guideline provides us with experience and reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, and the diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guideline and provided the newest diagnostic criteria of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which now is officially called the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March, WHO characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to fight against SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has developed a rapid advice guideline and that was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted great attention since published.
However, since COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research and clinical practice experience, and therefore diagnosis and treatment strategies are continuously updated.
The Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) among 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, have issued seven editions with some contexts substantially changing.
The guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., they introduced a simple scoring proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guideline and also make valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We endorse their significant work and express our thanks.
However, their work also needs update according to the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial seventh version) and recent studies.
The seventh edition (3 March 2020) requires combination of any one epidemiological history feature with two clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or needs to meet three clinical manifestations if without clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (2) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before symptom onset; (4) a history of contacting with cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts in the early onset stage; (4) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count in the early onset stage.
Confirming the case should be based on suspected case with any one item of pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) real-time PCR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) serum test with a negative IgG antibody and a titer rising ≥4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase; or a titer rising ≥4 times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase;
The real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification based on the researchers’ continuing work to search for an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as the respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which supported the specific antibody positive result.
Additionally, more and more evidence calls for caution with the atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
The flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as “low risk”.
The score system also needs to be verified in further clinical practice and studies.
To conclude, we hope more direct evidence is coming up and call for readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of “suspected case” and “confirmed case” we suggest to follow and follow the latest guidelines of their home countries.
Our team will also timely update our guideline to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, a daily high.
Today, Bangladesh has confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Yesterday, Bangladesh’s Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying home.
The total number of deaths has been recorded.
In an online news briefing, the Director of IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the deaths included four males and one female.
Dr Meerjady reported that two cases were above 60, two between 51 and 60, and one 41-50 years old.
The victims also reported from Bangladesh.
World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, Director of Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was kept in Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
The announcement was made on Saturday in an online video announcement, which announced that public transport would be shut down for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday.
This public transport shutdown started on March 26, and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Supply of essential goods, including medical, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first reported cases of COVID-19 in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 reaches one million infections worldwide
The total number of SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide exceeded one million, Johns Hopkins University data indicate.
At least 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone occurred on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had the first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed, as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries remaining free from coronavirus infections.
By yesterday the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours preceding the 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC).
In the United States, over 244 thousand coronavirus cases were recorded, linking to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that there were over 1,000 US deaths caused by coronavirus infections.
World-wide, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the disease from spreading.
The city Mayor Sergey Sobyanin extended the city lockdown to May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without working until April 30.
The parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favor, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the Holy City of Mecca and Medina to last for the whole day; previously the curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand is planning to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
The governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Australian toilet paper stores lower toilet paper limits per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their toilet paper purchase restrictions to two and one package per transaction in all national stores, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit on Monday.
This limitation was posted as messages on the checkouts and on the chains' Facebook pages.
Consumers were reportedly stocking up because of fears of COVID-19 in case people need to self-isolate.
Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one pack per order.
This follows the previous four-pack per transaction restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
While Coles reported that with the four-pack restriction in place, many stores still sell out within an hour of delivery, and ALDI on Tuesday called it "unprecedented".
Weekly sales went up in a "sharp increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesperson.
Costco’s store in Canberra also limited the allowed amount to two packs last week.
To help reduce the shortage, Coles ordered bigger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made early stock for a planned Wednesday special.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retailers Association, said that retailers try to raise stock, but local council restrictions on the time of truck delivery make it difficult.
The forecast is rising production costs as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer specials.
ALDI announced that after the early release of stock, some stores cannot run the Wednesday special.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, retail expert from Queensland University of Technology, said the stores fill the stock every night.
The item is a huge item, leading to low quantity of stock in numbers, and, when sold out, leaves vast shelf spaces empty, which further weakens the sense of shortage.
Russell Zimmerman of Coles and Woolworths says if there was plenty of stuff on the shelves, if toilet rolls and sanitiser were available in quantities, you would probably minimise the panic.
Recycled toilet paper producer Who Gives Crap said last Wednesday they were out of stock.
Kimberl-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to the News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported some property sellers offering free toilet paper to the first bidder on auctions in Melbourne, when less auctions were held because of buyers having time off on Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily printed in Darwin, included an eight page insert designed to be cut up and used as toilet paper.
The stores initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on March 3 that they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on the purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also highly in demand, including masks, sanitiser, dry goods, handwash and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, online British supermarket Ocado was observed limiting purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packs.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to how widely a disease has spread, but how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO called it a necessary effort to drive government action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization says.
Both are deeply concerned with the alarming levels of spread and severity and with alarming levels of inaction.
The pandemic is "unprecedented."
According to him, "other than influenza, no other respiratory virus has been tracked from emergence to continuous global spread."
WHO Secretary Tedros Ghebreyesus shared similar views, adding “we have never seen a pandemic started by a coronavirus.”
The WHO continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new status as pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
The United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease Director, Dr Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "bottom line, it's going to get worse."
As of Thursday, Associated Press reported there are at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in over 4,600 deaths.
The 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared to be a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in about 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated to be 4% in China, while globally ranging from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms is typically around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering one's mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who are infected.
Worldwide authorities have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard control, and facility closures.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies caused by panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed either on a national or local basis in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Fake news about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidences of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Because reduced travel and closure of heavy industry, air pollution and carbon emissions have declined.
WHO in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei province) reported a cluster of unknown cause pneumonia cases on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
The most common cases were linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, so the virus is thought to have zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV.
The first cluster of cases reported in December 2019, twothirds of cases were found to have a link with the market.
The South China Morning Post reported that a case traced back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old from Hubei province may have been the first.
There may be substantial underreporting of cases, particularly among those with milder symptoms.
Since 26 February, relatively few cases have been reported among young people, with those under the age of 19 making up 2.4% of cases worldwide.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have reported no testing for those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
The study published on 16 March found that in China, up to 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases.
The statistical analysis published 30 March estimates that infections in Italy were considerably greater than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
The study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention has concluded that it may be 5.7.
Most people recover from COVID-19.
For those who do not, the time from symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February about 80% of deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had pre-existing health conditions including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
The number of true deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of excess deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID death telling by a factor of 4-5x.
The CDC spokeswoman acknowledged that the death toll is underestimation, a statement corroborated by anecdotal reports of undercounting in the US.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, outside mainland China, more than 100 deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, including Antarctica.Several measures are commonly used to measure mortality.
The death-to-case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval.
Johns - Baltimore University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, death-to-case ratio declined from 17.3% (for those with symptom onset 1–10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptom onset after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
This statistic is not timebound and follows a specific population from infection through case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results from the first random testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of testing on CFR estimates.
The WHO asserts that the pandemic can be control.
The peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University states, “Left unchecked, infectious outbreaks typically settle and then decline when the disease runs out of available host.
It is almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be.
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan believes that the virus could be over by June if all countries mobilize to follow the WHO's advice on measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
The 17 March announcement from Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that SARS-CoV-2 is going to circulate for potentially a year or two.
The Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (potentially 18 months or more).
William Schaffer of Vanderbilt University believed that "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, and it might turn into a seasonal disease, making it return every year".
The virulence of the comeback depends on herd immunity and the extent of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (85%) and dry cough (67%).
Symptoms include fatigue, respiratory sputum production (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, headache, chills, diarrhoea, or cyanosis.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips.
Some of those infected may be without symptoms but with test results that confirm infection, so researchers have issued advice that close contacts with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from few to 44%.
The normal incubation period (the time between infection and symptom onset) ranges from one to 14 days, most commonly five days.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still being determined.
The disease is believed to be spread through close contact and small droplets produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking; close contact being within 1 to 2 metres (3–6 feet).
Studies have found that uncovered coughing can lead to droplets traveling up to 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
The virus may also be transmitted by small droplets that remain for longer periods in the air, which may be produced during speech.
The droplets can land in mouth or nose of people who are close to or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolized and thus result in airborne spread.
It may also spread when one touches contaminated surface, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are concerns it may spread by faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The China Government denied the possibility of faecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, but spread may occur before symptoms appear and later stages of the disease.
People have tested positive for the disease up to three days before onset of symptoms, suggesting transmission is possible before significant symptoms.
Only few laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not entirely clear how the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
However, this varies based on the humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
The virus is not known to pass to humans, but British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, like after contact with other surfaces infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.Outside human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
It is thought to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis has revealed that the coronavirus genetically clusters with the genus Betacoronavirus, in subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) together with two bat-derived strains.
It is 96% identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequence between pangolins and humans.
Whole-genome comparison to date has found at most 92% of genetic material shared between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host.
Infection by the virus is provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but confirmation is ultimately by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or CT imaging.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used to screen for or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are generally available within a few hours to days.
The test is carried out on a nasopharyngeal swab but throat swab may also be used.
As of 6 April 2020, no of these has been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for widespread use.
In the US a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging features on radiographs and computer tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an international database of imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Because of overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR without confirmation by PCR is of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT results to PCR and proved that while imaging is less specific for the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial Intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed to detect the virus’ imaging features with both radiographs and CT.
strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include washing hands, avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing into tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container.
The persons who may have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted or advised non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
The virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they were infected.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, over 100 expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth to monitor user proximity to other phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection, such as cleaning the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no COVID-19 vaccine, but many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after coughing or sneezing.
This is because outside human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
CDC further recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are available.
The WHO advises people to avoid touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 50% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, and 0.2–7.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing, and dispose of any tissue immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing a mask reduces the propensity of people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene."
The WHO has recommended wearing masks for healthy people only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, but they also recognise that wearing masks may help people avoid touching their face.
Various countries have started to encourage the use of face masks by public.
In the US, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face mask made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical face masks for healthy people, particularly when close contact (1 metre (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health officials are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovak Republic have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested everyone to wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has mandate that everyone entering a grocery store must wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all residents to wear face masks when in public.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks per day since mid March, asked passengers on train and intercity buses to wear face masks on 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever going outside, while also recommending the manufacture of a home made face mask for those who cannot purchase face masks.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a measure of infection control aimed at slowing the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres, or shopping centres.
Individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, no-contact greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by US government bodies and health organizations was swiftly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 spread in a region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
Early in March, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people.
The term “social distancing” has led to implications that people should be in complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means.
These include recommendations to only have sex with someone you live with who has the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Emergency isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they have been infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for all populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine guidelines have been issued to high risk groups.
The persons who may have been exposed to COVID-19 and those who recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the last possible exposure.
strategies in control of an outbreak are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
Early containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to identify and isolate infected individuals, as well introducing other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the disease is no longer possible to contain, efforts move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Epidemic control requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1.
This reduces the risk of health services being overloaded and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closure of schools and cancelling mass gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries also adopted a range of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movement of infected individuals.
Singapore provided financial support for infected who quarantined themselves and large fines for those who failed to do so.
Simulations for Great Britain and USA show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reverse epidemic growth) are major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overloaded.
However, surveillance is preferable but must be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in human population (or until a vaccine is available if that first comes first).
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic causes social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Following the advice above, drinking fluids and resting may help reduce symptoms.
Depends on the severity of the disease, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and breathing support may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen outcomes.
Various compounds previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating COVID-19.
The WHO also stated that some "traditional and home remedies” can provide relief of the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building and adapting healthcare for COVID-19 patients is defined by the WHO as a fundamental outbreak response measure.
ECDC and the European Regional Office of the WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for multiple levels of shifting resources, including focusing laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling elective procedures, isolating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capabilities by training and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds.
There are several theorys about where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may date to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increases.
These mostly linked to Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and one theory is that the virus originated from one of these animals; or, in other words, has zoonotic origin.
The group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were admonished by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and informed the World Health Organization.
Numerous cases of unknown pneumonia have been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to trigger an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled about seven and half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by the Chinese New Year migration and Wuhan being a major transport hub and major rail interchange.
On 20 January China reported nearly 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Early official data shows that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 90,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen Area have restricted free movement and set border control.
Responses include containment measures such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or lockdown) and curfews.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which reached 2.6 billion people two days later—around third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 has been traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 November.
Epidemic Doctor Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of unknown cause pneumonia cases on 26 December, upon which she reported to Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 revealed the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
The public notice was issued by Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
As these notifications occurred, doctors in Wuhan were warned by police for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, China launched a radical campaign which was later described as a "people's war" to contain the virus.
In what has been called "the most significant human quarantine in human history", a sanitation cordon was announced on 23 January, which was extended to total of 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people.
Private vehicle use was banned in the city.
Chinese New Year (25 January) celebrations were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was built afterwards, Leishenshan Hospital, to handle additional patients.
In addition to newly constructed hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan into temporary hospitals.
universities and schools around the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions instituted several measures, mainly in relation to schools and universities.
Remote working measures were instituted in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions were established in and outside of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums across China were temporarily closed.
Regulation of public movement was applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) faced some form of outdoor restriction.
Examples include Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travellers entering the city.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of domestically transmitted cases has been basically blocked and the outbreak has been controlled in China.
The same day travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed.
The persons wishing to enter China must apply for visas in Chinese diplomatic or consulate.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to re-open on 30 March, and provided monetary stimulus packages for businesses.
COVID-19 was confirmed to have spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are thought to be the origin of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, among 9,336 followers of the church, 1,261 or about 13% reported symptoms.South Korea declared the highest level of alert on 23 February 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, rising to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases were quarantined after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
Flights were also affected and therefore they were changed.South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best-organized programme in the world to screen the population for the virus, isolate infected people, and tracing and quarantining those who contacted them.
Testing methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new international arrivals through mobile application, drive-thru testing for the virus with results available the next day, and increasing testing capability to allow up to 20,000 people to be tested every day.
South Korea's programme is considered to be successful in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities.
Many Koreans signed petitions either calling for the impeachment of Moon over what they believed was government mishandling of the outbreak or praising his response.
On 23 March, South Korea had the lowest one-day case total in four weeks.
On 29 March it was reported that beginning 1 April all new overseas arrivals will be quarantined for two weeks.
According to media reports on 1 April, South Korea has received requests for virus testing assistance from 121 different countries.
According to the Health and Medical Education Ministry, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the government include cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events, and Friday prayers, and closures of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran allocated five billion rials to combat the virus.
Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that no plans to quarantine affected areas, and only individuals would be quarantined.
Cities were limited travel in March, but heavy traffic between cities ahead of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Holy shrines in Qom remain open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020.Iran became the centre of the virus after China in February.
In the face of claims of cover-up of the extent of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, suggesting that the outbreak may be more severe than the 388 reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was shut down, with 23 of its 290 members reported to have tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
Human Rights Watch asked the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It added that the virus is more likely to spread in closed institutions like detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, Iran’s government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the most reported in the country since the outbreak began.
The disease took about 12 sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials to die from it by 17 March.
By 23 March, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases every hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than what is reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may affect the country's financial capability to respond to the viral outbreak.
The Human Rights Commission has asked the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to ease economic sanctions for most affected countries, including Iran.
The outbreak was confirmed to have spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
cases started to rise, which prompted Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
The unassociated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.
Giuseppe Conte said, "In outbreak areas, entry and exit will not be provided.
Suspended work activities and sports events have been ordered in those areas.
All major sports events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but on 9 March, all sport was suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered a total stoppage of all commercial activity except supermarkets and pharmacies.
On 19 March Italy took the lead in world deaths from the pandemic after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, Russia sent nine military planes with medical equipment to Italy.
As of 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths, and 21,815 recoveries in Italy, with most of those occurring in Lombardy region.
The CNN report reported that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and inability to test all who have the virus to date may contribute to the high death rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed of the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any social distancing or mass quarantine measures on its citizens.
The government received criticism for its lack of pace and intensity in responding to public concerns.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments such as pubs and gyms were to close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages to a limit of £2,500 per month to prevent unemployment in the crisis.
The restrictions were enforceable by police through the issue of fines and dispersal of gatherings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with exceptions for businesses deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware shops, and garages.
The first known case of COVID-19 was confirmed in the Pacific Northwest state of Washington in a man who returned from Wuhan on 15 January.
The White House Coronavirus Task Force was established on 29 January.
The Trump administration declared a public health emergency, and placed restrictions on entry for travellers from China.
On 28 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control—the leading public health institutes of the US government—announced they had developed their own testing kit.
However, the United States had a slow start in testing, which obscured the true extent of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, lack of federal government approval for non-government test kits (academia, companies and hospitals) until the end of February (a doctor's order was required).
By 27 February, The Washington Post reported less than 4,000 tests have been conducted in the United States.

Laboratory testing for the respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavirus' RNA.
This test is specific and designed to only detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm recent or active infections.
Antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too minor symptoms to report or who were asymptomatic.
The accurate death rate of the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Because of limited testing, as of March 2020 no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in their population.
By 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of their population, and there are massive variations in how much testing has been done across countries.
This variability is likely to affect reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be significantly over-estimated in some countries.
Through real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the test can be done on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with throat swabs is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Later on the virus can disappear in the throat and continue to multiply in the lungs.
Infected people can be tested in the second week, alternatively samples can be taken from the deep airways by suction catheter or coughing up material (sputum) can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test by 23 January 2020. The South Korea company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical grade, PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
The PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from China's National Medical Products Administration for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.
One of three genetic tests in the old version of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to faulty reagents and a bottleneck of testing at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples a day being processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components was not determined to be reliable until 28 February 2020, and it was not until then that state and local laboratories were permitted to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an Emergency Use Authorization. US commercial laboratories started testing in early March 2020.
As of 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced nationwide availability of COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics similarly made nationwide COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020.
No quantity limitations were announced; specimen collection and processing must be performed according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Surveillance.On 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a high volume test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in high volume, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued EUA to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March Cepheid received EUA from the FDA for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
This method does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, and results can be produced in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
The current number of these machines is about 18,000 in the US and Abbott expects to ramp up production to deliver 50,000 tests per day.
A March 2020 literature review found that "chest radiographs are little diagnostic value in early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] findings may be present even before symptom onset."
ypical features on CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the origin of the current pandemic has suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many of its imaging features overlapping with other pneumonias and disease processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19".
Another part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals starting 7 days or so after symptoms, to determine immunity, and in population surveillance.
The high throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these assays but the availability will depend on the production rate for each system.
For CLT a single specimen of peripheral blood is commonly used, but serial specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For POCT a single sample of blood is usually obtained by skin puncture.
While PCR methods require extraction, a separate extraction step is not needed before assay.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.
The test capacity is several hundred samples within hours and thus much faster than the conventional PCR assay of viral RNA.
The antibodies are usually detectable 14 days after the onset of the infection. In April, the UK found no sufficient antibody test kits to use.
When suspected patients stay home, the emergency department will give them a specimen tube to the patient, they spit into it, send it back and get a test result a while later.
Through drive-through centers, South Korea has done some of the most extensive testing in any country.
Health insurance costs are paid by the health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
The Robert Koch Institute has an overall capacity for 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March drive in tests were offered in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests in Germany was unknown, because only positive results are reported.
In the first lab survey, as of calendar week 12/2020, at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.
With the construction overseen by BGI-founder Wang Jian and taking 5-days, modeling has shown that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of the quarantine would have doubled if this capacity was not on line.
The Wuhan Laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, and Shanghai, in total of 12 cities across China.
The daily throughput totals of 50,000 tests were reported. Open source, multiplexed designs by Origami Assays have been released that can test as many as 1122 patients for COVID19 using only 93 assays .
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent have become a bottleneck for mass testing in EU and UK and US.
The authors have started exploring protocols that involves heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing.
This was achieved through a combination of drive-through capability, and purchasing a population-scale mass throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
The laboratory was constructed in 14 days, and is the first in the world of this scale to be operational outside China.
Different testing recipes targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
World Health Organization adopted the German recipe for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries without resources to develop their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; the US Centers for Disease Control protocol was not available until 28 January, delaying available tests in the US.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's broad availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector labs, was built over several years by South Korea government.
The World Health Organization called for testing programmes as a best way to slow the advance of the pandemic.
In March 2020 China reported problems with accuracy in their test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "flaws"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing.
The firm explained that the incorrect results may be caused by failure to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish ministry said it will withdraw the kits that returned incorrect results, and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.
Turkey’s Health Minister Ateş Kara told the UK that they were "highly error-prone" and they were not used.
Testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and tracing of those with whom the SARS-CoV-2 positive people had contact, resulted in positive outcomes.
Scientists working in Vò, the site of the first death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on the total population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
About half of people testing positive had no symptoms, and all discovered cases were quarantined.
With restrictive travel to the community, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slowly than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions like forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore started advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on time after the holiday break on 23 March.
Other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact tracing, inbound travel restrictions, testing, and quarantining, such as Iceland and South Korea.
The statistical study has found that countries that have tested more, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, possibly because they are better able to detect those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacities and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Out of 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column “Positive as % of tests” is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that only tests people admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive as % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they display symptoms, other things being equal.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning one's hands for the purpose of removing soil, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap consistently at critical moments during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal–oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when soap is needed include before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's bottom or changing nappies, before feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If water and soap are available, hands can be cleaned with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning up a child who has used the toilet.
After breathing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animal, animal feed, or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene is a group of practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicine or medical care can prevent or minimise the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in medical field, but also an important practice for general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
Reduce infant death rate at home births.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing practices may lead to small improvements in the length of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, childhood death rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about three, and this is comparable to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of diarrhoea episodes can be prevented by hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years old, taking the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhoea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by one quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other sanitation interventions in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
The smallest negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to drying of skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can lead to itchy, flaky skin known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common in health care workers.
The frequent hand washing is also seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
The five critical times during the day when hands are washed with soap are after using the bathroom (urination, defecation), after feeding a child, before eating and before preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Other occasions when correct handwashing should be practiced to prevent disease transmission include after sneezing, coughing or breathing; after handling animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, hand washing with soap is low.
a study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap.
The “Essential Health Care Program” implemented by the Education Department in the Philippines is an example of at scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, supplemented with daily washing hands with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, is at the core of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Remove microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may hold bacteria acquired from previous use.
Small studies which have looked at bacterial transfer from contaminated solid soap have concluded that the bacteria are rinsed off with the foam.
The CDC still states "liquid soap with hands-free dispensing control is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.
To date, no evidence has been found that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a large list of resistant strains of organisms.
If antibiotic resistant strains are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are marketed to be.
Additionally, the complex formulations may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and further skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, plant extracts).
Comfortable water for hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing natural oils that hold soils and bacteria.
However, scientific studies have shown that warm water has no effect on reducing microbial load on hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-water-based hand hygiene agent.
In late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, alcohol rub non-water-based hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated together with thickening agent such as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) into a gel, or humectant such as glycerin into a liquid or foam for ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Additional diluted hydrogen-peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing a minimum of 60 to 95% alcohol are effective germ killers.
Alcohol rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers containing 70% alcohol kill 99.99% to 99.999% of the bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% of the bacteria on hands 1 minute after application.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk type viruses), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both hands and between and ends of all fingertips are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
Gloves must be washed well, rubbing them in both palms.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid killing activity against micro-organisms, but they should not be used as replacements for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur.
The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction compared to soap and water hand washing.
Non-water agents do not clean hands of organic material, but only disinfect them.
It is therefore that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on hands.
Alcohol-free hand sanitizer efficacy is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulation, and has historically underperformed alcohol and alcohol rubs.
More recently, formulations that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has a decreased efficacy after repeated use, possibly due to progressive skin reactions.
Many low-income people cannot afford soap and use ash or soil.
Ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms it may increase the spread of disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfecting agent because in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Correct handwashing technique recommended by US Centers for Disease Control for prevention of disease transmission includes the following steps:
Hand wash hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because standing basins may be contaminated, and the temperature of water does not seem to affect.
Then wash hands with a generous amount of soap, including the hands, between fingertips, and under nails.
Soap lifts germs from skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly when soap is used than water.
Scrub for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps remove germs from skin, and scrubbing for longer periods removes more germs.
Shampoo well with running water.
Cleaning in a basin can re-infect hands.
Dry with clean towels or allow to air dry.
The most commonly misdiagnosed areas are the fingertips, the wrist, the areas between the fingernails, and under fingernails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish may harbour microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep hands from drying out, which can increase the risk of infection.
Various low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing in situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries) using water-conserving solutions such as "tippy-taps" and other low-cost options.
Tippy-tap is a simple technology using a jug suspended by a rope, and foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over hands and soap.
Effective drying of hands is essential to hand hygiene, but there is some debate over the most effective form of drying in public washrooms.
The growing volume of research suggests paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many washrooms.
In 2008, a study conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the paper-towel industry the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, warm-air hand dryers and the more modern jet-air hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the warm-air dryer, the total number of bacteria was found to increase on average on the finger pads by 194% and on the palms by 254%.
Cleaning with the jet-air dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pads by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
Following washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average by 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.
The jet-air dryer, which blows air out of the unit at claimed speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), was capable of blowing micro-organisms from hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other washroom users and the washroom environment up to 2 metres away.
Use of a warm air hand dryer spreads micro-organisms up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacterial count after drying hands were observed:
Hand dryers are many different manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand washing using hand sanitizing wipes is an alternative during traveling in the absence of soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study has found decreased infection rates with their use.
Medical hand wash is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands.
Hand should be rubbed together with digits interlocking.
If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it.
Since germs may remain in water on hands, it is important to wash hands well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of hands from surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in health-care settings is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (germs) and prevent transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand-washing is still unacceptable in most medical environments, with large numbers of doctors and nurses routinely forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
The study shows that proper hand-washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infection by 66 percent.
The draft hand hygiene guidance by the organization is also available on its website for public comment.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby and al.
Commercial devices can measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
World Health Organization has Five Moments for hands washing:
exposure to blood/body fluids after exposure to blood/body fluids
Aseptic task, and after aseptic task.
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicated or antimicrobial soaps) confers killing action to a hand-washing agent.
'Cleaning' hands for surgery is essential to have a tap that can be turned on and off without touching the hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile towels for drying hands after washing, and a sterile instrument for cleaning under the fingernails.
All jewelry should be removed.
This procedure involves washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long scrub-times (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When rinsing, water on the forearms must not return to hands.
After hand washing is completed, hands are dry with sterile cloth and a surgical gown is donned.
To reduce the spread of germs, wash hands or use hand antiseptic before and after touching a sick person.
The most important benefit from hand-cleaning was found from the first 20% of washing, and that little additional benefit was gained when hand cleansing frequency was increased beyond 35%.
Cleaning with plain soap results in more than triple the rate of bacterial infectious disease transmitted to food than antibacterial soap.
Interventions to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings include education for staff on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based hand rub, and written and verbal reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research into which of these interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognised as a cost-effective, essential tool for good health and even good nutrition.
However, lack of reliable water, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and at work make it difficult to achieve universal hand washing behaviors.
In most rural Africa hand washing taps close to every private or public toilet are scarce, even though cheap options exist to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be caused by established habits, rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion and advocacy of hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness about hand washing and lead to long-term behavior change in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are needed.
The systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective at promoting hand washing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.
When minimum standards are achieved, schools can move from one to three stars.
Hand wash stations can be part of hand washing promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and child death.
Global Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavior change.
few studies have considered the overall cost effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to averted DALYs.
However, one review suggests that hand washing with soap is significantly more cost effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for vulnerable people like mothers who just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first recognised in mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by foul odor called miasmas.
In 1980s, foodborne outbreaks and health-associated infections led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as a key way to prevent infection.
The outbreak of Swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to a growing awareness in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
Posters with correct hand washing techniques were hung next to hand washing sinks in public toilets and in office and airport toilets in Germany.
The phrase "washing one's hands of" something, means declaring one's unwillingness to take responsibility for the thing or share complicity in it.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a much wider phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean an imaginary stain, representing her guilt about crimes she committed and induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after having recalled or contemplated untypical acts, tend to wash hands more often than others, and tend to value hand washing equipment more.
Additionally, those who are allowed to wash their hands after such contemplation are less likely to engage in other "cleansing" compensatory activities such as volunteering.
Islamic religions advise hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam mandate handwashing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam mandate hands before and after every meal.
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19
Workplace hazard control for COVID-19 is the application of occupational safety and health methods for hazard control to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease 2019.
The proper hazard control in the workplace depends on the worksite and job task, based on risk assessment of sources of exposure, disease severity in the community, and risk factors for individual workers who may be at risk of contracting COVID-19.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low exposure jobs have minimal contact with the public and other coworkers, for which hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene, and regular cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high population-density work environments, and some high volume retail settings.
Hazardous control measures for this group, including ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and personal protective equipment available in case of a person with COVID-19 is encountered.
Healthcare and mortuary workers exposed to known or suspected person with COVID-19 are at high exposure risk, which increases to very high risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Hazardous control appropriate for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the job task.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may leave work due to being sick, needing to care for others or fear of possible exposure.
Commerce patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are requested and the way of acquiring them (such as shopping at off-peak hours or through delivery or drive-through services).
Lastly, shipments of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used to guide protective actions.
Assessment plans address the risk levels associated with various worksites and job tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community settings, and individual risk factors such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
The guidelines also outline risks to address those risks, and preparedness plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or subnational recommendations.
Objectives for response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk for adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimising adverse effects on other entities in the chain.
The disease severity in the community where the business is located affects the responses taken.
The hierarchy of hazard control is a framework widely used in occupational safety and health to group hazard control by effectiveness.
Where COVID-19 hazards cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control, and lastly personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls are aimed at isolating employees from work-related hazards without rely on worker behavior.
Administrative control is a change in work policy or procedure that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but can prevent some exposure.
All PPE types must be properly fitted as applicable (e.g. respirators), consistently and properly worn, regularly inspected, maintained, and replaced as necessary, and properly disposed or disposed of to prevent contamination.
According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and other coworkers.
basic infection prevention measures for all workplaces include frequent hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene including covering cough and sneeze, providing tissue and trash receptacles, preparing for telecommuting or staggered shifts if needed, and routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
Prompt identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a key step in protecting workers, customers, and others at a worksite.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home for at least 24 hours without fever-reducing or other symptom-altering medicines, and that sick leave policies are flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees are aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the business location or because the individual recently travelled to a location with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high-density work environments, and some high volume retail settings.Administrative controls for this and higher risk groups include providing workers with adequate education and training on COVID-19 risk factors and protective behaviors, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, providing resources and a work environment that promotes personal hygiene, and making workers aware of hand washing, and posting signage about hand washing, and advertising hand washing, and making signs about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and making signs about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing, and advertising about hand washing,
workers in this risk group rarely require respiratory therapy.
If a person becomes sick on an airplane, proper controls to protect workers and other passengers include keeping the sick person from others by a distance of 6 feet, designating one crew member to serve the sick person, and providing face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissues when coughing or sneezing.
Crew should wear disposable medical gloves when tending to a sick traveler or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick traveler has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.
CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person has been in a school building regardless of community spread.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies include canceling field trips, assemblies, and large gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in a cafeteria, increasing the space between desks, staggering arrival and dismissal times, limiting nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office location for children with flu-like symptoms.
When substantial transmission occurs in the local community, including social distancing strategies, extended school dismissals may be considered.
Law enforcement officials who must make contact with individuals confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including proper personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during apprehension, workers should clean and disinfect their duty belt and gear prior to reuse using household cleaning spray or wipe, and follow standard operating procedures for disposal and disposal of used PPE and for containing and laundry clothes.
OSHA considers certain healthcare and mortuary workers to be at high or very high risk categories.
High exposure risk jobs include healthcare delivery, support, laboratory, and medical transport workers who are exposed to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These become very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures on, or collect or handle specimens from, known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-generating procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and exams, or invasive specimen collection.
Very high exposure risk mortuary jobs include workers preparing the body of people who had known or suspected cases of COVID-19 at the time of their death, and these become very high risk if they perform an autopsy.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some healthcare and mortuary settings.
Biosafety Level 3 procedures are essential.
WHO recommends that incoming patients be divided into distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected to be infected with SARS-CoV-2, and those performing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 filtering facepiece respirators or better must be used in a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes fit-testing, training and medical examination.
Other respiratory types can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for point-of-entry screening personnel.
WHO recommends a surgical mask, goggles, or face shield, gown, and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the lack of PPE in the global supply chain, WHO recommends minimising the need for PPE through telemedicine, clear windows, allowing only those in direct care to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, using only the PPE necessary for the specific task, continuing use of the same respirator without removing it, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and prohibiting the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SEND DATE/TIME: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSING: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in remarkable circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have to each other.
We do not have precedent for its challenges, but we do know that our best response depends on the sort of global empathy, cooperation, and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and care we have seen among all our colleagues over email, calls, and chats is a remarkable validation of the incredible humans we are fortunate enough to work with.
couldn’t be more grateful and proud to count you all as colleagues.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
The messages reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and what a powerful symbol it is for this critical resource to remain online and available to all.
Your work ensures this, whether you keep the sites up or our fellows paid or our community safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
This is a moment in which not only what we do, but how we do, will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we will be making some significant changes to how we work together, starting this week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned previously, the c-team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and how to keep the organization sustainable during this time.
Overall we wanted to remove stress and support our mission for a long term.
If you need to dial back, that’s fine.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
The daily working hours will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We are not declaring a holiday - if you can work more normal hours, the mission can use you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for your family, get groceries or go to the doctor, your wellbeing is our priority.
We do not track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
This should go without saying, but we’re saying it.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team revise calendars and schedules to ensure key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please let Bryan in T&C Operations know so T&C can help support and ensure your situation gets proper attention from management).
Hourly folks will be paid full time.
We have already said, and are recomminging to honor our commitments to our contractors and hourly staff colleagues.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours worked during normal circumstances.
This includes if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially during such times.
Again, this is about your self-care.
Our ask is that you communicate with your manager so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are some things we must keep doing.
The SRE, HR Operations, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) do critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and shift our focus to supporting what is essential for our mission.
There is plenty to do for all of us, but we will focus on the most essential projects.
Slow now will not hurt later.
We do not plan to go “double-time to catch up” after the pandemic has passed.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines which are now unrealistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and will work to set new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What happens with the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new reality and daily working hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timeline for delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
The goal is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allow employees to prioritize critical work, self-care, and care for loved ones over the next few weeks.
This timeline extension greatly reduces current planning workloads and pressure across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will update delegates and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office status, exposure, and cleaning
The following week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of abundance of caution, we employed an antiviral cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
The team used a hospital-grade anti-viral solution to disinfect every surface, including the lobby and elevator banks accessing our floor.
The building is using its own duty-of-care protocol using products that support their tenants.
We feel confident that the office will be prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC staff members.
As of this week, our DC office moved to a full remote setup in line with the guidance shared with San Francisco.
As some of our NYC-based colleagues know, we have also been discussing leasing a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is continuing but may be delayed.
Some of our fellows are working remotely for the first time.
Our long time remote colleagues know that it can be an adjustment, and wanted to offer some advice:
Limit the length of meetings to at least one or two hour intervals.
If longer sessions are required, consider how they can be broken up over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda, and send reading materials ahead.
Make video the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate live collaboration and connection.
Recruit a lead to facilitate every meeting, someone to monitor the chat for questions and track the speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or collaborative notetaking).
Send email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your wellness reimbursement for snacks.
Subscribe to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk with your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is exploring webinar-based ergonomics guidance to support the increase in distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel Wikimedia-funded public events, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic to be over.
The recipients are told that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make them unable to complete their agreed-upon grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delay or change those goals.
This week we will follow with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic community conferences.
The general sentiment from around the global community seems to be both sadness at the disruption but relief at the ability to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and otherwise.
The CRT is working on a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for community to monitor the impact and follow our communication with them.
Keeping up to date with COVID-19 related issues
We’ll be sending an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time with each other.
We are in this together and here to help as we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information from this email, and all other essential COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff who are currently living in countries that are significantly affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, major workstream, or coverage challenge, please do not hesitate to contact and work with the CRT.
We are here to provide support and liaison as needed.
If you have confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and obligations.
The declarations are a recognition that at this moment, our work and obligations may need to adapt in a way we have not done in the past.
This is the steps we believe are needed to support this one another so that we can continue working, provide our movement with the support they need, and the world with the service they rely on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
Once again, it is time to support one another and create space for the important work that will be coming in the weeks and potentially months ahead.
We need all of you to make that happen, and so we need you to take care of yourself and your family so you can be at your best when necessary.
Now please wash your hands and do not touch your face!

Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestine.
ACE2 counters the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang(1-7) making it a promising drug target for treating cardiovascular disease.
Human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Adenosin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
ACE2 protein contains an N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single pass type I membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain visible on the surface of cells in lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is divided from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the blood stream and ultimately excreted into urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membranes of mainly lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the brain, brainstem, and brainstem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as counterbalance to ACE.
ACE cleaves angiotensin I hormone into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 releases the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also cleave a number of other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzymatic domain of ACE2 on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into endosomes located in cells.
This entry process also involves priming of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently investigated as a potential therapeutic.
However, multiple professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in risk of pneumonia compared with controls."
Moreover, pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia related death, but the results were less robust than for overall risk of pneumonia.
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and appears to improve lung hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes, along with a course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
B'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to aid contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying persons (contacts) who may have been in contact with an infected individual.
Numerous applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks for building contact tracing apps have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems that are based on tracking the location of app users.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to monitor user's proximity to other phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has deployed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
It is in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, a TraceTogether app is being used.
The app was developed by local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.
The app was developed by the Communication and Technology Ministers and Health Ministers.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was waiting for approval from Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
The government stated that the contact tracing app was in advanced stage of development, and would be available for deployment within weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed several potential problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if takeup of the app is restricted to a small fraction of the population.
Following concerns about misleading or harmful "coronavirus apps", Apple set limits on which types of organizations can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only official or otherwise reputable organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy campaigners voiced concerns about the consequences of mass surveillance using coronavirus apps, particularly about whether surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the pandemic will be dismantled after the pandemic has passed.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions on government projects:
surveillance would have to be "lawful, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of monitoring and surveillance would have to have sunset clauses;
The use of data would have to be restricted to COVID-19 purposes;
evidence would be sufficient to ensure data security and anonymity;
Digital surveillance would have to prevent exacerbation of discrimination and marginalisation;
Third party data sharing would have to be defined in law;
There would be safeguards against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
a "meaningful participation" by all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including public health experts and marginalised groups.
The proposed Google/Apple plan aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracing mechanism from their devices once it is no longer needed.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to perform contact tracing.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system collected information from a variety of sources including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, and combined them to produce notices via text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made the location information publicly available, something permitted because of far-reaching privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public via several apps and websites. Countries including Germany considered to use both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the details have not been released.
Privacy-preserving contact tracing is well established, with a substantial body of research literature dating back to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, over 10 expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as Bluetooth low energy (BLE) to monitor user proximity to other phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a co-ordination effort that includes both centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all matching happens on-device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab is working on SafePaths, a platform for using privacy-preserving techniques when collecting and using location or path intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The research is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Keeping Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising privacy of that data.
The global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that have essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the goal to reduce fragmentation, and enable global interoperability of tracing and alerting apps, a key aspect of widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, Singapore government announced that it had open sourced the BlueTrace protocol used in its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed would protect privacy, using Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications of core technologies used in the system.
The system is planned to be rolled out in three stages:
rolling out tools to allow governments to create official privacy-preserving coronavirus tracing apps
integrated this function directly into iOS and AndroidGoogle and Apple plan to address take-up and persistent surveillance problems by first distributing the system through operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing, re-profiling, re-tasking or therapeutic switching) is the repurposing of an approved drug for the treatment of a different disease or medical condition than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one line of scientific research which is currently undertaken to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.
Analyzing those binding sites provide reasonable opportunity for development of effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papain-like protease, RNA dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al studied several candidate compounds which then optimized and analysed for their skeleton similarity with the highest approved drugs in order to accelerate a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug development in his preclinical study to be recommended in a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some auto-immune diseases.
On 18 March, the World Health Organization announced that chloroquine and the related hydroxychloroquine would be included in the Solidarity clinical trial.
Connecticut governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March.
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA's clinical trial process and is authorised under the EU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC has said that "the use, dosing, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not yet established.
Doctors have told them they are using the drug when "no other option is available".
The Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of preventative use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show favipiravir was "clearly effective".
35 patients in Shenzhen tested negative in a median of 4 days, while the length of illness was 11 days in the 45 patients who received it.
In a study conducted in Wuhan on 240 patients with pneumonia, half of them received favipiravir and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence for the drug is scant and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug from Japan for its stockpile, and use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
The South China Morning Post reports that Shinzo Abe has made requests to the Trump administration about purchasing the drug.
It may not be safe for use by pregnant women or those trying to conceive.
One study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV from replicating by binding to the protease.
The team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that will bind with the protease of SARS-CoV-2.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections . Gilead Sciences later discovered that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filo-, pneumo-, and corona-viruses .
One issue with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
The early pretrial studies suggest remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several clinical trials underway, including two conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals, one for moderate illness and another for those with more severe illness.
There are three ongoing clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19, two placebo controlled (China, Canada) and one with no control (Italy).
New York State started trials for the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.

A form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients recruited from severe, hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.
Scientists from Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6000 adults aged 40 and over who experience mild symptoms without hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective contraceptive method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multicenter study on 300 patients researching the use of enoxaparin sodium for prophylaxis and therapy was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, considerable scientific attention has been focused on repurposing approved anti-viral drugs that were developed for prior outbreaks such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for COVID-19 treatment according to Chinese 7th edition guidelines.
Some antibiotics that have been identified as potentially repurposable as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Also trials in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are multiple attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it expected a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
The outbreak is expected to spread around the world in 2020, leading to considerable investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
According to April, the CEPI initiative for vaccine development is speed, capacity, scale, and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under development and development to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Major platform targets advanced into Phase I safety studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Vector (Phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
The total number of vaccine candidates is 115, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 others announced but with little public information (probably in planning or design).
Phase I II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing, typically randomized, placebo-controlled, and at multiple sites, while determining more effective, effective doses.
Phase III trials typically include more participants, including a control group, and test effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
The 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed as early April 2020) have not yet been human evaluation (still in preclinical research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.

vaccine development and manufacture is involved in development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners further announced plans for preclinical testing and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, India's Health Ministry announced they are working with 11 isolates, and even on a slow track it could take around half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported development of a coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is in laboratory research, with human testing planned for July or August 2020.
The Guardian reported that the US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money' for exclusive access to a Covid-19 vaccine", against which Germany protested.
On 17 March 2020, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
RNA-based vaccine candidate BNT162 is currently in pre-clinical testing with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotech company announced they will have pre-clinical testing results in April 2020 and the final vaccine candidate could begin human testing in fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the CEPI announced a $4.9 million investment in a COVID-19 vaccine research consortium involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in COVID-19 vaccine development to US$29 million.
CEPI's other investment partners for COVID-19 vaccine development are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists have started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Imperial College London researchers announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including numerous vaccine candidates at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Around the same time, the Canada government announced C$192 million for developing a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to build a national “vaccine bank” of several new vaccines that could be used if another outbreak occurs.
The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on testing of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, which reported that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines produced potent antigen-specific antibodies in the mice, which appeared to be evident beginning 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced design of a DNA-based vaccine as a possible nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will replicate inside human bacteria to produce harmless virus-like particles, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
The benefits of preventing disease can extend beyond the disease they prevent.
A further randomized trial in Australia is seeking to enrol 4,170 health workers.
It is possible that developmental vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early studies to assess vaccine efficacy using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals, and nonhuman primates, indicate a need for biosafety level 3 containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
VACCINES against SARS and MERS have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, no cure or protective vaccine for SARS has been reported to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of novel vaccines and medicines to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS became prevalent, it was thought that existing SARS research may provide useful template for developing vaccines and therapies against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine which completed phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are viral vectored vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory claiming the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
The patents cited by various social media posts reference existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread between people during close contact, often via small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets are produced when breathing out, they usually fall to the ground or surfaces rather than being infectious over long distances.
People may also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
The most communicable disease occurs during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, but spread may occur before symptoms and later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for mask use by general public vary, with some authorities recommending against their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease has been recorded in most countries across all six WHO regions.
Infected with the virus may remain without symptoms or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and bluish face or lips.
Less commonly, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may occur.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been reported in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented with chest tightness and palpitations.
Occasionally the disease may progress to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically five to six days but may range from two to 14 days.
99.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not display symptoms is currently unknown and is being investigated, with the Korea Center for Disease Control (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases remained without symptoms during their hospital stay.
CHINA’s National Health Commission began including asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April, of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Loud talking releases more droplets than normal talking.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered cough can lead to droplets traveling up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Though the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Science has suggested that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors positioned outside people's rooms produced samples positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions to be aerosolised and thus result in airborne spread.
The virus is most contagious when people are symptomatic, but spread may occur before symptoms emerge.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says while it is not entirely clear how the disease spreads, one person generally infects two to three others. The virus survives for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to be detectable for one day on cardboard, for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene), and stainless steel (AISI 304), and for up to four hours on 99% copper.
This varies depending on the humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if correctly used; soap products degrade the virus' fatty protective layer, deactivating it, and freeing them from skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a Hong Kong study saliva samples were collected a median of two days after hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day tested.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature.
In human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which breaks its protective bubble.
The lungs are the most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called a "spike" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was found in 12% of infected people admitted to hospital in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be caused by ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in heart function.
Increased incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be related to poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism for ACE2-expressing respiratory tract epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 usually exhibit systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells were shown to correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory IL-6-secreting monocytes and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported at autopsy.
The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, but nasal swab or sputum may also be used.
Results are generally available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests are available, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results have little immediate value.
Scientists in China isolated a strain of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so laboratories across the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person had been infected in the past) were in development but are yet not widely used.
The Chinese experience with testing has shown the accuracy is only 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the USA approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use at the end of that month.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
Microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19 are few data available about microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, lung consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
healing pneumonia: organisation of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least 20 seconds, exercise good respiratory hygiene and avoid touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow if no tissue is available.
Hygiene after any cough or sneeze is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public settings, partly to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.
Distance guidelines also include people staying at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no medication known to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021, a key part of managing COVID-19 is trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as “flattening the curve”.
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after coughing or sneezing.
The WHO recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitiser with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are available.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity is arising from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis.
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
People are managed with supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatment may be helpful in those with mild symptoms at the early stage of infection.
Epidemiologists and pulmonologists in the US have compiled treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April, no specific treatment for COVID-19 is available.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) over ibuprofen for first line use.
Early detection of virus transmission is essential, especially in healthcare settings when performing procedures that produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
Healthcare professionals care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to standard precautions, contact precautions and airborne precautions.
The recommended gear is PPE gown, respirator or facemask, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial settings but the FDA has authorised the masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
Their purpose is to protect against airborne particles like dust but effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as a last resort, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with COVID-19 related respiratory failure is actively investigated in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be prevented with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Both of these two lead to the same benefit for people who are critically ill.
While these are most common in older adults (those older than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, which limits the capacity of a health system to handle a sudden spike in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalisation.
One study in China found 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical support of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospital with COVID-19 are eventually admitted to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen delivery and minimise the risk of ventilator-associated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilators.
Investigation into potential treatments started in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medications may take up to 2021 to develop, several of the medications being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medication may be tried in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends volunteers participate in trials of effectiveness and safeness of potential treatments.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to show it is safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are requested to enter their name and ID number.
The app is able to detect close contact using surveillance data and thus potential risk of infection.
Every user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials.
In March, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track mobile phone data of people suspected to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to enforce quarantine and protect those who may have contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to research and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia deployed facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breakers.
According to Gallera, he has been informed by mobile phone operators that "40% of people are still moving around anyway".
German government conducted a 48 hours weekend hackathon with more than 42.000 participants.
Also the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global call for creative solutions against the spread of coronavirus.
Individuals may experience distress from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
According to the BBC, "Increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic downturn are the perfect storm to harm people's mental health and wellbeing.
The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, similar to common upper respiratory disease such as the common cold.
Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, like SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking.
In most severely affected cases, COVID-19 may rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-organ failure.
Associated complications with COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal clotting and damage to heart, kidney and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, specifically an increase in prothrombin time, have been described in 6% of those admitted to hospital with COVID-19, and abnormal kidney function is seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who present with COVID-19 display high liver enzymes (transaminases).
The median time between symptoms and death was ten days, with five spent in hospital.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalisation and death.
In a study of early cases, the median time from starting symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a death rate of 2.8% and women had a death rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examination of postmortem lung samples shows diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumococci.
The lung picture resembles acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was reported as high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized had preexisting conditions.
The mortality from the condition is often a different range, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The undercounting of mild cases can cause the death rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases can mean the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death compared to non-smokers. Concerns have been raised about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a drop in lung capacity in some people who recover from the disease, and lung scans suggested organ damage.
This may also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown if past infection provides effective and long-term immunity in people who recover from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases in which recovery from COVID-19 followed positive coronavirus tests have been reported.
This is believed to be worsening of a lingering infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and have animal origin, through spillover infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of infection was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
The first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed the earliest onset of symptoms as 1 December 2019.
Official publications from the WHO reported the earliest onset of symptoms as 8 December 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to measure death.
This number is varies by region and over time and is influenced by the volume of testing, healthcare system quality, treatment options, time since initial outbreak, population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO signed the emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 with no lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Johns - Baltimore University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percent of diagnosed individuals who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percent of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
This statistic is not time bound and follows a specific population from infection through case resolution.
Antibodies may provide information about how many people have been infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) are already dead.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals, and spread to younger people, causing relatively lower deaths.
Additionally, the German health system has not been overloaded.
In Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as assessed from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its death rate are different for men and women.
mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with the gap between men and women ending at 90.
In China, death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this sex-difference are not known, but genetic and behavioural factors may be a reason.
Gender-based immunological differences, higher prevalence of smoking in women and men developing co-morbid conditions such as hypertension at younger age than women may have contributed to the higher death in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died with COVID-19 were men.
As of April, the US government is not tracking sex-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral illnesses like Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
The higher proportion of health workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they have higher chances of being exposed to the virus.
World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations for naming to prevent stigmatisation.
The WHO also uses the COVID-19 virus and the virus responsible for COVID-19 in public communication.
Both the disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines on location in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Because of capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver in timescale required, a local startup reverse engineered and print the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention and treatment of the disease and rapidly spread online.
Humans are appearing to be capable of spreading the virus to other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccine is available to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines in COVID-19 is underway by government organisations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the “SOLIDITY Trial” to assess treatment effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no available vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers aim to build a whole virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, be it inactive or dead, is aimed at evoking prompt immune response of human body to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, is aimed at creating a vaccine that sensitises the immune system to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus intrude the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a novel technique for creating a vaccination).
Experimental vaccines from any of these strategies would have to be tested for safety and efficacy.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease.Antibody-dependent enhancement has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials were evaluating already approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Repurposed antiviral drugs are most important in China, with nine phase III trials on remdesivir across several countries due to report by April.
The dynamic review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and drug candidates was established in April 2020.Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use remdesivir.
Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are calls for peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, states that twice that dose is highly dangerous and may lead to death.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition guidelines also include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide has been recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Studies have reported that initial spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE2 receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from embracing these therapies without further study.
Cytokine storm can be a complication in later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been included in treatment guidelines by China's National Health Commission after a small study was carried out.
It is undergoing a phase 2 non-randomised national test in Italy after positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is aimed at countering such developments, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies for treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, no randomised, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunisation.
This strategy was tried for SARS with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralisation is the anticipated mechanism by which passive antibody therapy can mediate defence against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, such as manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
Supply of convalescent serum, which is the liquid portion of the blood from recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for quicker deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Central Hospital of Wuhan, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
