Republican strategy to counter the re-election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, Brennan Centre considers this a myth, stating that electoral fraud is rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in the past decade.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine American democracy.
American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that most American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011.
The new election laws require voters to show a photo ID card and proof of US citizenship.
Additionally, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and remove the right to vote for citizens with a criminal record.
Before 2006 elections, no US State required voters to show a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first State to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
The Republican authorities quickly extended this practice to other States.
The agency has sponsored bills in 34 States to force voters to show a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal ID card such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of age, do not have a photo ID card issued by a government agency of their State.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
It often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionally affect young people, minorities and low income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters 18-29 years old do not have the required photo ID card.
And that is not all.
Students, considered to be more pro-Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several States to use the photo ID card issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these States allow fishing or hunting club members who vote more Republican to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen States have adopted laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
This is clearly intended to limit the Hispanic vote.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic party.
Moreover, in 2011 Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing registration of voters on election day in eight States.
In addition, they limit the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
This restrictive measure is not without consequences.
Examples are the 2004 general election, when voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have created laws in five other States to reduce the early voting period.
Examples are in Florida, where 33% of early voters were African Americans, who accounted for only 13% of the State's voters.
The same applies to Hispanics.
This represents only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted early.
The other hand, 76% of voters were white but these represent only 46% of early voters.
However, Democratic legislators and their supporters vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by vetoes of Democratic governors.
The United States Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The team was able to partially limit the damage.
Examples are only 16 out of 34 States have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
However, the new rules will probably make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan character of the laws that have been passed and see a clear objective of influencing the 2012 results in key States.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed to win the Presidency.
It is too early to guarantee that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: take the test or not?
In fact, PSA test sometimes produces erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results, which involve unnecessary medical intervention.
They are enough to make already reluctant men avoid screening tests.
Take test or not?
We asked two specialists for their opinion.
In studies conducted in the USA, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret the data and make firm recommendations.
The second study, this time a European one, concluded that there was no difference in death between patients who were screened and those who were not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that metastasis occurs between 30 and 40% more likely than in absence of screening.
The test is recommended from age 50, or 40 if you have a direct relative with previous prostate cancer.
African American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
aggressive cancers and others are indolent.
The patient needs to be made to understand the risk of his cancer by offering him the options available, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long-term life-threatening, and instead, taking a further opportunity to active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have cancer have been detected will not be treated because the cancer is not aggressive and is not life-threatening.
Active monitoring will be suggested, and if the disease progresses, they will be offered treatment.
More and more specific criteria are being defined to determine who should or should not be treated.
It is therefore recommended to take the test.
The important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not to take it.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society [IUS], Movember has created a tool that allows evaluation of the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing disease
No miracle recipe for preventing cancer is available.
Although progress in research, healthy living habits remain the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
When no more people smoked, this rate would increase to at least 50%.
The other hand, approximately 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Some are completely unexplained.
The Canadian Cancer Society remains a priority, despite the decline in smokers.
Cigarettes are linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This massively damages people's health.
However, still 1.5 million smokers are in Quebec, according to spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up smoking, the risk of dying from cancer drops by half.
Weight
Both overweight and obesity are also associated with the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
The risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus is increasing.
"Research shows that regular practice of physical activity throughout your life protects against colon cancer" it is also said.
Diet
The organisation also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, it increases the risk of developing colo-rectal cancer.
Likewise, cured meat products are avoidable.
The conservation of meat by smoking, drying or curing can cause the formation of carcinogens.
They can damage cells in the body and lead to cancer development.
Vitamins
In recent years, a number of scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
The research is inconclusive.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one study reported a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another reported an increase.
Also the effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clear.
Additionally, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Taking a screening test does not give you cancer."
Higgs boson revealed
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir last summer, and with good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, no less.
It is the last particle predicted by the Standard Model - our best or less worst explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
The Higgs is still not fully known.
The particle is a new authentic particle, and very closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a large physics Congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still lack of data to be entirely sure.
It is the Higgs, since the chances of mistake seem low, and see what it is.
In our world, there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same time.
There is no way to break this rule - and try too hard, you will go mad.
However, even though particle physics is a very strange world, it also has a similar law: the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting of roughly some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner we have good citizens called fermions, who wisely follow the Pauli principle.
Then lurking in the other are the bosons, a nasty band of anarchists who do not respect anything - at all events, not this principle, which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time.
The bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the Berkeley Labs Particle Adventure site (absolutely incredible) - mesons, which we will not discuss here, and force particles, to which the Higgs boson may be somehow related.
This boson must be stressed here, are not all such exotic bugs as you may think.
In fact, if you can read this article, it is thanks to an incredibly banal boson: the photon, or the "light particle" which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this specific place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and thus one of the "force carrier" bosons.
More stable field
The same applies to Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" to produce the boson.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it requires very, very high energy levels, which is very like a very large rock to wrinkle the surface.
The reason for this is that a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with 27km circumference! - is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with 27km circumference! - is needed to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful for explaining the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact not all particles, or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper will never stick to a fridge.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass have mass, while others (such as the photon) do not.
What is all this research "can bring"? asks Ms Plamondon.
For science, it is designed to check the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and also allows physicians to assess any discrepations between observations and predictions of the SM.
The few ones who are eager to find them are eager to find them, because the tiny change could open the door to a new physics and plug certain holes in the Model.
This is a huge shortcoming, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-oops!).
But no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Repercussions
The impacts of this research on the daily life of the street man is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be no damage.
Remember: in the early 60s, the pioneers of the laser at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that would follow.
The students had a brief understanding of scientific applications, but nothing about the rest.
The late Willard Boyle - a physicist who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed in 1962) - told us that initially the laser was seen as a lab gadget.
imagine...
And then applications can also come from all the instrumentation that is surrounding research.
Examples are Willard Boyle and a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all original intention, now serves as an eye to all digital cameras worldwide, and earned him the Nobel physics prize in 2009.
This is not of course a guarantee that the activities of the LHC will always transform our lives, but it does mean that you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Dying with dignity Commission, Quebec recently discussed the sensitive issue of death.
The debate is due to start shortly as a bill is prepared.
However, in this vital area, much remains to be done.
The Devoir tried to look closely.
The last few weeks Mr L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The surgery for prostate cancer had given him two years respite.
They gave me five years to live, I have made it to seven.
However, it still is a shock, you can never be prepared for it.
The disease is doing its work: huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Looking at an appetizing lunch, he agrees to be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, talk to the strangers around him, bringing him his medication, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"I want most to be cured of my diarrhoea, it is humiliating" he told.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this illness.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois home.
Regressing to the stage of a child for some people is unacceptable.
It depends on the person's ability to accept the regression, he says.
Because, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments occur at the heart of such regression.
Victor-Gadbois palliative care home patients all suffer from cancer.
Their maximum life expectancy is three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides curative care.
For Mr A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocating."
Disease has made me discover my children.
"I have fine children" she adds.
'I do not wish for anything more in life' she says, before accepting having a mask on to help her breathe.
The family is still looking forward to a last visit by her son from Italy.
Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers provides bodily care and feeding.
This is palliative care, given when no other action is possible.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there are palliative care beds for 11,700 people.
This is very few when we know that we all will die one day.
Here, life continues under the best conditions, explains Dr Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Physical comfort, emotional or spiritual level.
A person who is dying will accept being helped to drink brandy or Pepsi, whatever is their tipple.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar.
Death is part of everyday life.
Today evening, a beer was served to Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the dead.
Relatives are more important than patients, says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
Victor-Gadbois home, one day follows another but no two are like.
A 93-year-old man is sitting firmly in his swaddling blankets, while toasts are served in his honour.
Since six months there have been three to five beds which are occupied by cancer patients less than 45 years of age.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home come from their homes, 47% from hospital.
Poor access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians have no access to palliative care, which is care designed to ease pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life, be it home, hospital or care home.
The number of organisations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, specialise more or less in cancer care.
It is precisely this large gap in Quebec health care that has made many palliative care professionals fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care luminaries including Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone will be able to access quality palliative care before it is accepted to die.
Recently, she says, a patient spent 14 days in emergency, in great pain, without any action to ease her pain.
I am afraid that patients ask to die because they do not receive adequate care.
In contrast, some oncologists work without giving up the last day of their patients, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already minimal when she ended chemotherapy.
When I announced to my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me she regretted that I gave up fighting, she said.
However, she had told me I was finished!
No all-powerful care
Dr Martel believes that 90% of patients asking to die thank caregivers for not having given them their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
However, palliative care is not always all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Palliative Care Director with the Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, patients are resistant to pain treatment in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which is equivalent to sleeping until death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to understand this part of their suffering.
Inevitably, an unrelieved patient will have the option of such palliative sedation.
Patients who are not relieved always say the same thing: "I want to die."
It does not necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," but it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible thanks to a journalism award from Canada health research institutes.
Spreading real estate scandals in Quebec
Hours after day highway officials, building contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell what they know about a formidable "system" combining building industry, government officials, politicians, trade unionists and organised crime.
The industry has cost Quebec taxpayers a huge amount, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
The system is interesting, says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec politician and former Montreal Police Chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke in 2011, in an in-depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only reluctantly consented.
The "Ducneau report" established direct links between industry, under-the-table financing of parties and bribery of officials.
Since the investigation opened in 2010, the Transport Ministry has reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts, with some people curbing their instincts to get a share!
The Charbonneau Commission has already brought down two mayors, and it is looking to "reveal the schemes behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011.
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also coupled with its army of government analysts, investigators and auditors.
More than that, the "Marteau squad" policemen who, since 2009, have been apparently led by the Montreal "sewer cartel" to soft pedal on contract inflation...
In recent weeks, it has conducted several searches and called charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, Mayor of a suburban town.
Next on the list is apparently Gilles Vaillancourt, who has recently resigned from his position as Mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Canada.
The suspected recipient of repeated bribes for public contracts is suspected of pocketing repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Others formally accused are Montreal highway engineers and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a sensation by explaining the mechanics of the public contracts "system" to the Commission.
The mafia linked to the contracts in Montreal paid 3% of the value of the contracts to an intermediary linked to the mafia, who then paid the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
Zambito has handed out money freely in the 2000s, giving over 88,000 Canadian dollars (roughly 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
The suspect also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Cheap water contracts
In Montreal, the corruption "system" ran smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, former public works engineer, detailed it in the Commission: In ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants and bribes totaling 736,000 dollars in exchange for sewer contracts, which he inflated the costs.
Other highway officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices by 30 to 40%, and by false adds.
Then an organizing member of the Mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately blocking his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women in Montreal to raise the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the East of the island, she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal land for 5 million dollars and resold for... 1.6 million to developers at the peak of the real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
The investigation will eventually be implemented, she says, "is following a thread to find out how the system - infiltrated by ants - works, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
The process, she says, is painful but positive.
The wound is being cleaned, but Montreal would need its own investigative unit with ongoing monitoring to prevent the return of these questionable practices.
How to clean house.
Properly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected people aware of the scheme" when they were not up to their necks in the scam!
Estimates of the share of dirty money in election campaigns in Quebec at 70%, he says dryly: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to 100 dollars, but this will not change the situation, he says.
Advocate for a complete overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding: "We cannot go any lower, but getting to the bottom of things with courage will help build the house on more solid foundations, with more control and laws."
Although this story damages the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau invites anyone to look in their own backyard...
PSG is not FC Barcelona!
This season you have taken on a new height with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Some great players have arrived.
Every day I am making progress alongside them.
The technical staff has also brought me a lot.
Day by day, all these things help me raise my level of play.
In a match, it's easier.
All things move very fast in football.
But I cannot get worked up.
From my debut at Clairefontaine INF pre-training centre to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always moved step by step.
So you benefit from the competition brought in by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer recruits are trained to play high level matches.
They also know that every training session is important.
What makes a player like me want to face up and give my best.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot regarding my position.
The support is provided by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Anfield is the man for the job?
Always.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all experts.
Today he has no equal in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
The player has many years of experience and has won many titles with top clubs.
The player has worked with great players.
I think he will bring more titles to Paris.
In January I had an encouraging discussion with him.
I was just coming back from a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What importance do you attach to the first part of the season for PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us to the top.
We are waiting on the sidelines.
One of our main goal is the Champions League: we qualified for the last 16 in the right way.
What is the club's goal in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
Then we will have something to say against some very good European teams.
First of all, we want to finish top in our pool, ahead of Porto, to have home advantage in the last 16 matches.
PSG can become the European top club in short term?
It already has the budget...
To become a top European club, Paris need to win titles and keep it up over time.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, PSG has the means to achieve it.
In Ligue 1, would not winning the title, like last season, be a major failure?
It would be a major disappointment.
This year, we are really committed to winning the championship.
We were not far away last season.
In May, there was great disappointment because we were good enough to finish first.
It was a wonderful season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, 79 points is good enough to be top...
Another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
I think this is the year.
If big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are competing for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much of PSG?
It is normal for them to expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After we won 4-0 at home against Troyes and still found things to blame us for, that's a bit frustrating.
You wonder what more you expect.
You're never going to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a game project.
It takes time to build a team.
The Champions League proved we could hold our own.
Look at Manchester City who, for two seasons, have not qualified for the last 16 despite having spent huge amounts!
Based on the amount you invested, you should be 15 points ahead at winter break!
It would be to ignore our opposition and the French Championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were no good last season, were "boosted" by the new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say that, despite all the difficulties, we finally did it.
PSG seem to be totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Zlatan dependence is so much so that people say there is "Zlatan dependence."
This means Ibrahimovic is very successful and scores many goals.
The reason he came is to prove he is the star of Ligue 1.
The player has always proved that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group we respect the man and the player.
And also he respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is simply exceptional.
It pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also helps everyone progress.
How did you get in Euro 2012 with France team?
A disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this Euro.
However, my injury prevented me from getting any game time.
They saw some things there and came out stronger.
Today I play well in selection matches.
The Blues are what I have been waiting for since my baptism with the Blues.
I have learned the lessons from what happened in Ukraine and now I owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about Didier Deschamps' first months in charge of the Blues?
The results he wanted are achieved.
We are well placed in World Qualifying Group.
The coach is tight, close to the players, and inspires them to win.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
It is not necessary to make any comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal when we qualified for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will take the Blues to Brazil.
The good draw (1-1) snatched in Spain on 16 October represents a founding match?
That match gave us confidence.
Everybody fights for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks.
The opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing fees among the parties involved.
In addition, as often in these technologies, political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, which was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but converted into dollars, euros) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
Around 200,000 transactions have been recorded via 15,000 computers on the network.
Close to a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or payments.
The bitcoin exchange rate, after reaching a peak of 30 dollars (23 euros), fell to 2 dollars five months later, returning to around dozen dollars (rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive compared to global transactions in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took interest in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as 'credits', used to progress in a video game you play or which you can exchange for.
The social network Facebook has also developed this system.
However, on each occasion, a central authority monitors and handles the exchange.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the account book, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does the network work?
The transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The set of information associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The file is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins are kept in the public book of accounts, broadcast across the network.
Key step is entering the new transaction in the book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to computers, and the winner, a kind of interim central bank, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital print.
Computer takes the new transaction and adds a number to it, then hash it all up.
The goal is to find the number that gives a special imprint (lots of zeros at the beginning).
After this number is found, other nodes can easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would alter the imprint.
If a user wanted to defraud by paying two times with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have different imprints.
The computer that resolves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this award is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore restricted to 21 million, but they are divided down to the 100 millionth, leaving some margin...
The challenge is also enhanced with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has had its ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stole.
The loophole used is not the protocol itself, says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also highlights the possibility of money laundering using this anonymous service.
Cash also has this weakness.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Other platforms, such as the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from Weizmann Institute in Israel, analysed the accounting books and found that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge selloffs" were launched.
"Three thousand dollars were exchanged" welcomes Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins to gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, is very confident in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
The system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless payment by mobile, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which thus becomes cheaper.
Also the user manages his identity and can be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement by merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They only need to provide an address that a phone can recognise, says Pierre Noizat.
There is a general movement to re-appraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
It will take time for Bitcoin to become firmly established, but 2013 could be the turning point.
The ECB, in its report, says it will reassess the risks currently considered high, in the event of the success of the currency.
We got out of Afghanistan.
What now?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and Americans are due to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to return to its territory and the Afghan people to choose their future.
It is mainly Afghan peasants that we have punished by calling them terrorists.
Ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded, the dead.
The Taliban is composed of foreign extremists, former leaders in refugee in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign arms, like in the time of the Soviets.
Their desire to defend their traditions, both ancient and archaic, has been shared by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Tajiks.
The latter will no longer be so when Westerners become scarce.
The departure of French troops from Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with French funding, was carried out in a orderly fashion.
Heavy trucks and armored vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflowing with helicopters.
The Taliban will not spread in Kabul by the end of 2014.
Conditions have changed since the inevitable advance between 1994 and 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty, the country being torn apart by fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was thought to be a sort of liberation, a return to safety.
They paid the price of the obscurantism of these poor people by the organisation of Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahidines, the Afghan Government and the current Taliban are linked in the desire to keep women in inferior position.
The main anti-Soviet war leaders returned to power in 2001.
Their role in the development of government land was to build land for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from large American outsource contracts.
Their silence has become discredited; what’s more, most of them did not fight themselves.
The people, as I heard in the country, want a Government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave as American largesse will leave: the flight of capital is considerable.
The young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
Their feet have touched the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, and they have appreciated the benefits.
Around 65% of the population is under 25; Kabul now has 5 million people, a fifth of the total population.
In towns and cities, the state schools are full, with girls and boys alike.
It will be necessary to provide work for young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the past or the corruption of some leaders.
All of them, including the armed opponents, are partial to mobile phones; television, with its Turkish soap operas, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Should the authorities who command it be considered legitimate?
Soviet commanders are already thinking about restoring provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
However, Afghanistan, a mountain country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralisation, in the image of Western countries, but the United States wanted to make it a centralised State with strong presidential power, by eliminating the post of Prime Minister, which had been established since 1964.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly on the occasion of the April 2014 elections.
The country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and already since before.
No industries have been re-established, no dams are in good condition, no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
All is imported; no produced, except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is left to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three years of war, government control over the infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan had huge mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
With no energy to process the iron or copper on site, or transport to export it across the mountain ranges, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost left the Mes Aynak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which large imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations.
The departure of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty allows for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' high school, boys' high school, French Department at the University, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive action, a civil-military action service from the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), closed in 2012, has carried out, and continues to carried out successfully, through a small French NGO, many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages.
This project involves large numbers of local labour, has helped contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in cultivable areas.
What will we leave as a souvenir after two billion euros of military spending?
More modest budgets would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often located over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agriculture projects from local communities in Kapisa province.
To be in a position to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is what farmers told me they want, a small amount of civil aid should be maintained in their favour, well controlled and directly affecting them.
A forced constitution in Egypt
New gamble for President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, he has decided to go for broke.
Surprised everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text on the following day.
The Head of State gave the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
For two years Egypt has relied on a provisional text, changed several times, which has weakened institutions and led to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative only serves to enhance the divide in the country.
The President is persevering in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "back on his word" and "trampal the law."
The advocates believe that this is the quickest way to end the institutional and political crisis, by speeding the transition process.
A referendum is due to be held within two weeks.
The Brothers have a short period of time, which forces them to abandon their plan to explain the text, article by article, to Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to achieve popular and democratic legitimacy while the dispute rages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be confident that Egyptians will vote favorably, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Particularly since a hasty vote sounds like an ultimatum to Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I keep full powers."
The strange atmosphere that 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, with large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals were missing.
In mid November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling they had failed to assert their views.
Human rights, minority groups or civil society have done similarly.
In order to obtain a quorum, 11 alternates were added yesterday morning.
Some are close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
The articles were mostly unanimely voted.
They also marveled at one of the only diversions of the day, which was a reflection of the Constituent Assembly clock.
The text, which is still being voted on yesterday evening, has 234 articles.
The main focus of attention, article 2, remains in the final analysis identical to the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which Islamic law is a major claim, wanted to replace "the principles" with "the rules," which would have allowed stricter application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article was not changed is a guarantee of goodwill and respect for other elements of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" responds the liberals, who see only communication coup.
Because in their opinion Islamisation of the Constitution is done through other articles.
The latter refers to article 220, which grants Al-Azhar University an advisory role, with particular reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is a serious concern because the people called on to advise are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This suggests the beginnings of a theocracy.
The liberals' fears are also fueled by the fact that the next Rector of the university will likely be much less moderate than the current one.
"For time being, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, things remain under civil rule.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Islamic law scholars but academics, some trained in the French system.
The scholar acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity regarding article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
Particular reference is made to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, Editor's note].
The question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce on it.
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers argue that they are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the previous regime.
Other issue is the authority conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the Defence Budget review will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No civil trials will be banned in military tribunals, as requested by human rights organizations.
Who also voice their concerns about the text, which they consider repressive.
The fence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
In addition, no more articles describe women, highlights Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
In her opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the President was speaking yesterday evening on television, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the Head of State will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Holy places are waiting for Ukrainian tourists, the omphalos and a saline water sea.
The Holy Land combines the splendor of biblical truths, modern comfort and prime nature.
AIF [Facts and Fact] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to visit Israel.
Please celebrate the sacred places.
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is considered that all who enter this baptism "bath" are blessed by God.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his magic: turned water into wine at a wedding, walked on water, calmed a storm, and filled the nets.
This is also where Jesus appeared before his disciples and after his resurrection.
The most important number of Holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk through the Grief or Dolorosa Way.
The journey starts from the Antonia Fortress - Praetorium - where the judgement occurred, and continues through the Old Town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha - the place of the crucifixion, Stone of Unction and place of Jesus' death.
This is also the location of the symbolic Christian omphalos, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem is built on the site where the tree used to make the cross for Jesus' crucifixion.
The most sacred places for Jews are the Wailing Wall, which is the only surviving part of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes here with their wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Travel along a vertical axis
Massada Fortress is a secret retreat from enemies, built by Herod in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on cliffs in the mountain range at an elevation of 450 m above sea level.
They can be reached on foot only by those who are into mountain climbing.
Others are transported to this historical mountaintop by a cableway.
In the north of the country, at an elevation of 1600-2040 m, there is a famous ski resort called Hermon, which is filled with tourists in winter months.
The bus brings people to it from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of ski pistes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods used to live on the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country has about 300 museums.
You cannot visit all of them on one trip.
The five most interesting ones are worth a visit.
The Museum of Israel is located close to Knesset (Parliament).
It has ancient Qumran manuscripts and Dead Sea scrolls found in the caves of the Judean desert, along with about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artefacts.
The Art Museum in Tel Aviv is also interesting.
The exhibits include a wide range of impressionists and expressionists like Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Sisley, Cezanne, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the bath museum Al Basha, which is a collection of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and bath attendants of the time.
In Caesarea, you can visit the private Ralli Museum, where you can enjoy the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides or gift shops.
Entry is free, and contributions are strictly prohibited.
The fifth is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel-Aviv, which tells one of the most dramatic stories in history.
The most tragic section is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go in and find yourself in complete darkness.
Stars are glimmering, sparkles.
Listen to names of Jewish children and countries where they die.
Ukraine is mentioned in the article too.
Wellness
There are three resort areas in Israel, located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea.
Each have swimming pools, aquaparks, dolphinaria and oceanaria.
The remarkable fact is that one can swim in the Red Sea even in winter months, because water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees.
Dead Sea is even warmer, and people swim in it all year round.
Incidentally, it is the most unusual sea in the world, located in the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water is saline and easily keeps you afloat, even if you do not know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are surreal in their beauty.
People come here to undergo a treatment course with salt water - wraps and medicinal muds, and to improve their health if they have dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, or diabetes.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
The remains are conserved in the old section of Tel-Aviv - in the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean Sea.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia runs through it.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
The legend says that this is where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beauty Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists really like to walk the narrow streets named after Zodiac sign.
They say, if you touch the wall on the street of your sign, fortune will come to you.
In Jaffa you can meet new brides from all over Israel and even from other countries for photo sessions.
In Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can walk around a Roman theater, "capture" the Crusader fortress.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman commanders, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist note
If you go to Israel, do not worry about your poor English knowledge.
For the trip, it is better to take dollars, not euros, because they are easy to exchange for shekels (currently 1 dollar = 3.8 shekels).
Cities are mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the only subway line in the country, comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower town.
In essence, it is an underground cable railway.
A ticket for any type of city transport costs 6 shekels, and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers.
According to Jewish tradition, Sabbath is celebrated in Israel.
The following Friday evening and sunset on Saturday, markets, stores, and public transport stop working.
The work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels have only kosher food, with no meat, fish, fish with no scales or foods that mix milk with meat.
The wide range of dishes from lamb and beef, soups and desserts cooked with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, various sauces, falafel (balls made of ground chickpeas), fruit and vegetables.
The street in Israel is not full of homeless dogs.
There are many well fed cats, which walk around lazily.
In the evening, they can even sleep on the roofs of parked cars.
This pussycat likes busy places and does not refuse treats.
Cheap car rental, depending on the type, costs from 37 (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) dollars a day.
Plus insurance of 15 dollars a day.
Bike rental costs 15 shekels a day.
Museum entrance costs 30 shekels on average.
In numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from around the world visited Israel.
Visitors and holidaymakers mostly arrive from USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, and Ukraine.
January and October 2012 118,800 Ukrainian tourists visited the Holy Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the removal of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
Only the high and mighty get to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of mandatory language testing, the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russia cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families back home.
New law was implemented on December 1, which requires every migrant worker to pass a Russian language test.
The law is currently only applicable to those who intend to work in services, housing and utility services, household services, and retail.
With time - as promised by the Federal Migration Service - tests will be mandatory for all non-residents.
In addition to language, Russian history and basic legal system will be tested.
Language knowledge will be confirmed both to receive and extend the work permit.
An exception is effective only for citizens of countries where Russian is a state language.
People who received education certificates and diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also exempted under the law.
Purpose, doom, and protection of rights
Seven testing points will be operating under the supervision of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, People’s Friendship University of Russia, Moscow State University (MGU), and other Russian education institutions.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities; more than 160 such centres have been opened.
The initiative to introducing the testing was supported by State Duma members and the Federal Migration Services.
Human rights activists, repeatedly asked in the press before the law came into force: what will it actually achieve?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and for non-residents?
First of all, according to representatives of the migration service, this will reduce the number of people suffering from labour slavery.
Many people are talking about protection of work migrant rights, explains the Head of the Representative Office of the Federal Migration Services of Russia, Viktor Sebelev.
Rights protection should begin before they depart.
Only organized selection will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without profession, education, who do not know Russian, who do not have a medical certificate start to have problems.
If a migrant does not understand the language, he is doomed to meet unconscious people who, pretending to help, will force him to a "ticket" to a huge, cramped barracks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents.
We receive many complaints from our migrant migrants.
They are promised one thing at home, but when they arrive, they are lied to, their passports are taken, they are not paid what they were promised.
Not be angry, boss!
However, many Central Asian citizens who plan to work in Russia admit that not only their understanding of the language of the country they are going to work is poor, but they can barely write in their own language.
However, this is not so much their fault, but due to poverty: very few Turks, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can even access basic education.
Their families do not have food to feed their children, not even enough clothing, shoes, and supplies.
After reaching adolescence, these kids go to work at the first opportunity.
It is hard, if language knowledge is poor, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Human rights activists note one important point about language law.
Testing will be conducted only for migrants with legal status.
If they have no status, no testing or official work will be done in the future.
In the meantime most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or No Unauthorized Entry"
Many foreigners claim that official status in our country is not that easy.
The reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles.
Whereas a fake registration is done quickly and costs only one and half thousand.
The Russian Police know that we mainly have fake papers, without registration, therefore the extortion.
They ask for hundred or two for cigarettes, tea, according to journalists.
"Roll up, not be cheap, get your art"
The first day of the law's entry into force, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents can be fake.
A few forged certificates about passing language tests have been seized by Federal Migration Services officers already.
Forged documents are printed on a standard colour printer.
The boxes were not free for their owner: each migrant who wanted to facilitate the task of passing the tests paid seven thousand rubles for them.
It is two and half times more than the official testing process, which costs three thousand.
Officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot be just bought.
The authorities are able to offer time to complete a basic language course.
In addition, those who do not have Russian language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people.
The Interior Minister does not return arms from the illegal market into circulation.
The share of crime involving legal weapons is extremely low.
The Russian Ministry of Interior is proposing to tighten the law for owners of civil weapons.
This is the response of authorities to recent events: CLICK shots at weddings, where no casualties were reported, and the murder of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, resulting in CLICK death of seven people.
Police want to prohibit carrying weapons in public places and raise the legal age of weapon licensing from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Safety and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
No one is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by "tightening the screws."
The open letter has been published, which authors - representatives of different social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the "senseless toughening."
The percentage of crime involving registered weapons is low, according to the criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov to BBC Russia.
According to the Interior Ministry's statistics, 142 cases of firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012, while total crimes have been recorded for this period.
Authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the "black market".
According to them, any weapon is available at low prices right now.
However, the Interior Ministry maintains that the situation of the spread of illegal arms is under control.
Suppliers: from plants to officers
The "black" market of weapons is replenished through several channels.
There are five such channels, explains retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who has worked in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for 10 years.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons.
First: "army or military loot" i.e. weapons that were stolen during the Caucasus fight.
"Weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by Caucasians," Baranets says.
Next are "black weapons" stole by criminals from representatives of defence agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons taken from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement agencies' employees.
Legal arms are taken to be sold from military warehouses.
Blasts have often been heard at military warehouses.
Theories are based on theories that some of the fires were intentional, to cover the shortage.
Manufacturers of weapons make their contribution, according to Baranets.
These are so many private weapons factories now, which do not survive international competition and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market, including in Moscow.
Other source of "black" market is trafficking.
The most high number of guns and machine guns are from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
They produce, sometimes hand-made, and a mafia has formed, which has organized a stream.
How do the weapons come from?
Experts counted the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons to the black market.
The report about this was prepared by the Centre of Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning in 2011.
Experts analysed the reports of the Interior and Rosstat, criminology literature and open data from weapons portals.
The majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, are from the military and security forces.
Half of all arms on the black market are there "because of officials who work with weapons" in the report.
According to researchers' data, 17% of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas, 14% is theft during production, and 5% is "black archaeology."
The sales consultant of one of the weapons stores, who wished to remain anonymous, says that the weapons found by "black" diggers are no longer being used, because they are too old.
According to him, dealers go to the military warehouse for a new batch of goods.
One piece, such as a TT gun can be bought from a warrant officer.
It is issued to him, and given through the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it for 900 euros a piece with two magazines," he says.
The truth is that police are aware of everything, and therefore periodically, when crime detection rate is low, it conducts test purchases from illegal weapons merchants.
"Like in a luxury store"
The buyer and seller often meet through friends.
Looking at sites, blogs, until someone responded, offering me to go to Begovaya station, where a man will be waiting for me to take me to the "corner" so we can negotiate.
The price of the weapon only when I found out the price of the weapon.
Viktor Baranets, military commentator
To get a weapon, I need someone with connections, but I am not sure it is reliable.
There are workers on labor markets, but one must "come" there conditionally "from John Doe, who asked to tell his daughter that she lost a tooth."
Currently, even if I need a few knuckledusters, I get them through someone I trust.
Then he only supplies them to me, because he knows that I will not give him away.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Military man Viktor Baranets tried to acquire illegal weapons in mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about this.
The formulas are still the same, according to him.
The album was given with "anything and everything."
"I felt like I was in luxury store," he says.
Baranets says the buyer is not offered a pig in a poke - you can try everything.
I, potential client, am not just buying; we go to the forest with the seller and set a target there.
When I am given the opportunity to shoot, I am given the opportunity to negotiate, and when I am certain that the weapon is good, we begin to negotiate.
Store on a sofa
Internet search leads to sites and "Vkontakte" groups, where weapons for different purposes are offered.
No documents or personal meetings are needed.
"It's enough to have a certain sum of money," says the advertisement on the website "Buy a pistol or rifle."
User requests and questions are asked.
Minor buy?
"Without a license, of course," asks user "John" (name is changed).
"Want to buy a TT, Moscow," briefly asks "Fedorenkov."
Federal Security Service now spreads a network of fake sites and there are many potential buyers of military weapons.
People come like hungry fish to bait, and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military commentator and former military man Viktor Baranets
I heard about this: normally the site is registered outside the area of application of the Russian law.
People accept orders.
The buyer pays at an ATM.
In response, a photo is sent with instructions on where the weapon is hidden.
Viktor Baranets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can stay without weapon and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service now spreads a network of fake sites and there are many potential buyers of military weapons.
They are like hungry fish after bait, and end in Siberia mining coal.
Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal firearms, 100 to 900 dollars is enough, according to experts.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the Rights to Weapons Organization, a Makarov gun can be acquired for 100-300 dollars.
The wait time is a month to a half.
It is shipped from long term storage warehouses by mid-level management of these warehouses.
According to official statistics of the authorities, the number of such crimes in Russia in general declined by 7% compared to January-October 2011, amounting to 22,900, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and explosive devices declined by 7.8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers are on strike in USA.
Up to fourth of American teenagers have worked at McDonald's at one time or another.
In recent days, a wave of protests has been reported in the USA against low salaries in Walmart supermarkets and popular fast food chain restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fade out early.
Actions are supported by unions and a series of left-wing organizations.
In addition to increasing the low wage received by Walmart and fast food chains, the protesters aim to create unions within them.
This sector of the economy is not covered by any union movement yet.
46 cents a year?
actions began last week after Thanksgiving, on Black Friday, when mass sales attracted millions of people in America, sometimes accompanied by clash.
On this day, some employees of Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their workplaces and picketed with the unions and left-wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to low to medium-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in major supermarkets.
The most low-paid Walmart employees shop only at their work place.
Availability and assortment made Walmart one of the most important American corporations.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about hard work conditions, such as lack of lift trucks and handheld scanners.
Occupation workers on Black Friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month.
The average Walmart employee, receiving 9.5 dollars/hour, cannot afford this.
Scientists from Berkeley University in California argue that if Walmart raise the average salary to 12 dollars/hour, it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on salaries right now.
If Walmart fully shifts the cost of increasing wages to the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more.
In one year, they will only spend 12.39 dollars more than now.
Walmart supporters happily note that the protests occurred in nine states and no damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 in the evening on Thursday to midnight the next day, and during this period Walmart sold about 5000 products a second.
In total, its cash registers conducted nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Representative of the corporation, Dan Fogelman, told the Huffington Post that the total number of Walmart employees left the workforce was "less than five" and the protest was just a PR trick of the union that organized it.
Free cash register!
They continue this week in New York, where they were not Walmart (they are not so welcome in progressive city, so they do not exist here yet).
McDonalds says that it sells billions of portions, and despite this it does not give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the City Council of New York
The current minimum salary according to federal and NY law is 7.25 dollars an hour.
Average employees in New York earn 8.90 dollars/hour.
Nobody earns less in this expensive city.
I cannot understand how one can survive in New York on this money.
Then, almost fourth of American teenagers worked at McDonald's, working part-time after school, living with parents.
The most serious people saw this as a source of living or plan to stay there for long.
Then I continue to see interviews with McDonald's employees who complain that they have to survive on this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
The other comment on the Wall Street Journal forum says that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how you will feed them.
Participants of the protest started at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of the chain be paid at least 15 dollars/hour, which is more than double their present wage.
They also demanded the creation of unions in the fast food industry.
American law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing union activists by nagging or shooting.
The administration does not often ease their life.
However, for objective reasons it is difficult to cover fast food with a union.
One of them is unusual turnover of employees.
Disagreeing
Noisy protests started on this day in several cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The most important event was the afternoon meeting at McDonald's by Times Square, where several local democratic politicians spoke out.
Demonstrations were supported by other prominent NY democrats, including Bill de Blasio, a candidate for NY city mayor, who said: "We need to voice our support for the fast food employees, so they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing, which every New Yorker deserves!"
The New York Times reports that this was the most important action of this kind in the American fast food industry.
The event was only a few hundred people, and many of them were not fast food employees, which is a huge population in New York.
It is unclear now whether this will spark a mass movement.
"At the moment, the mind cannot be too well deceived"
Among modern technology fans a popular topic is augmented reality, which is now seen mainly through special glasses.
First, a functional model was shown by Google in summer, at its annual conference. Then in November Microsoft filed an application for patent.
However, according to the conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group in Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, glasses are a thing of past for Microsoft scientists.
Their interest is in manipulating virtual objects in air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us in simple terms about your research group.
- We work on the interaction of people with machines, at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
While people generally are stuck with working with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing finger at them.
We want to look 5-10 years into the future and predict cardinal changes in this interaction.
Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward. Almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today, because everyone likes to control by gestures.
- What else is awaits us in the future?
- Despite the fact that Kinect shifted the interaction to the physical level, much still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information entry has improved (the system receives more data), but output still needs to improve.
We are trying to change this, working on truly three-dimensional display systems using various technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
This is why we need to identify both the user and the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
Above all, get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is popular, but is it over-estimated?
- It clearly cannot be called a cure-for-all, but privacy is a concern, because we do not always want to tell others about our actions and intentions.
All types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
Examples are a project to control devices in public places, which was focused on movements, not wide movements but small, reserved ones.
Movements were not recorded by a camera, but by a hand bracelet that determined the movement of bones and muscles.
It is huge right now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a hand watch.
In general, the future lies in the mix control, e.g. movement + voice.
What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this bottle of water?
You will talk and show at the same time.
- Usually I just say.
- It will be very difficult to detect.
- So you want to make users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that moment?
- Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approximation.
In the near future, we will mainly work on developing new sensors that will allow more precise determination of a person's reaction.
This could be, e.g. laser sensors. They have a good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something else?
- Generally, the current generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three-dimensional recognition.
Then, it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k/s speed.
It is not only the mega pixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From the latter perspective, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers.
The resolution on the X, Y, and Z axis is important.
Speed, number of images per second, is also important.
Human movements are relatively dynamic, and current 30 k/s is really not enough for gestures.
Steven Bathiche from our Redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing delay from 1 to 100 ms, while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator (60-100).
No one knows how this affects the interaction between man and machine.
In my work, it would be very helpful to have a device that does not require touching and would have more images per second.
- Do the number of cameras need to be increased?
- In Kinect there are three cameras now, one being an infrared emitter and the second one, the receiver of the signal.
The third one is actually a regular sensor of visible range.
It is not used to determine the object's depth.
Potentially, a large number of cameras could solve the problem...
However, it can be worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue Kinect, play with the flexion of camera position and see how this will help in three-dimensional determination of the position.
- As far as I know, Microsoft has not presented its glasses to the public, unlike Google.
What do you think is the most promising platform for the daily use of augmented reality technologies?
- It is not very convenient to walk around with a smart phone in your hands all the time, but I think that the coolest option is transitional augmented reality, where you can shift from glasses to smart phone, projection display, and everything else based on a cloud platform.
glasses are very personal devices, which is their strength (private things are only seen by you) and, at the same time, their weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects with other people.
- Imagine for a minute that manipulating virtual hologramic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Ironman but to a regular person.
The problem with this idea is that the critics often point out: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What answers do you have prepared for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine.
The eighth will probably be the addition of tactile sensations.
The most interesting trick is to use the second hand as a sort of matrix for the image.
It is great at registering pushes!
The technology is really aimed at giving these "images in the air" a sense of tangibility, for example, the interference of several targeted ultrasound rays in the specific point where the finger is located gives a sensation, but very weak now, as if someone blew your fingertip.
Bracelets that affect the nerve endings in fingertips are also a good area.
- Have you try to deceive the mind?
To force it to think that it feels something that it should feel when it sees something?
- This is a good idea and we have not tried it yet.
The challenge is one that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open, almost limitless space. We are working on treadmills (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, and giant balloons.
So far deceiving the mind has had limited success, but there is work for many years to come.
The reason why virtual reality is so attractive to researchers is that many things are in their very beginnings.
Judgement calls instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project St. Petersburg Avant-garde, dedicated to residents who are ahead in the avant-garde of culture and art.
This list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city, often recognised in Europe, but which have a huge influence in Russia.
New player in Rosbalt is the bold artist Kirill Miller.
The city knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed all red, who can be seen in the Russian Museum, or in Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and shows.
Kirill Miller's work always attracts crowds of people no matter where they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the most exclusively St Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythology.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of late 80's early 90's.
Moreover, he is a city man, who makes people smile on street and lifts everyone's spirit.
Then he took up the street organ and became St. Petersburg's music man, because he was ready for this complex role with all his Bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you walk all around the city in red, not yellow or turquoise?
- I chose red as a fashion designer with a focus on look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between artist, image-maker and society.
Although in society, everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad kind.
But my provocations are aimed at starting conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- When you realized that you must be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky House of Culture, where my work was displayed.
It was clear to me that this is my path.
Then, the wave of old, unofficial artists started, and new, free artists like me were not understood.
New wave artists, post-Gaza-Nevsky style artists, led to Pushkinskaya-10, and the wave was no longer.
I am drawn to theatre, clothing, music, all genres except literature.
- And all this has been united in your Art-clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the centre of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should come together.
In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and while the renovation work was still underway, there was a musical and creative club, a Bohemian club, the house of the St. Petersburg Bohemia.
Many were born there: NOMy, Tequila Jazz, I remember when Shnur was brought to the Van Gogh's Ear project.
Shnur and his friends lip sang easy songs, wearing tight leotards, and the now trendy composer Igor Vdovin was with them.
The group started to play live, and it became Leningrad.
Trakhtenberg was the presenter of many programs before Hali-Gali times.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and a great career was on its way, but the basic education and mentoring he received from us was essential.
GALLERY D 137, Griboyedov club - all these echo the Art-clinic.
The place where our staff and regular customers left for.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture was something.
In 2000, a press poll for the People of Our City prize was held.
Then I was nominated for Artist of the Year, my climax took place.
In new times, it is uncomfortable to work by old rules.
In our time, it is easy to become popular but culture and popularity are different. You can be popular but not very cultural.
- Your work is marked by a recognised style.
- Many of my works are hits, with clearly reflected relevance and acuity.
I will have a programme exhibit, "Russian museum in clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I was social before, now it is painful and scary to be like that.
But everything is blurred in clowns, tragedy is removed.
Large, I have large ideas.
Examples of totalitarian changing of clothing by order.
Today people are judged by appearance, not their inner qualities.
Who knows, maybe you cannot shake his hand and need to spit in his face.
The lie will go away with the help of changing clothing.
- Recently you saw you in the role of music man. - A cultural city should have such character.
Who fits the role better than I?
- Maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art should be neat, considerate, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
People used to get together in flocks, Bohemians liked one thing, the simple people, something else.
Now everyone is divided into micro societies, it's hard to be liked by everyone.
I am not a hundred dollar bill to please all.
Now you have to think who you will please.
Now, each cult hero has 100 fans.
- However, several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov!
- The cast-outs go to see him, sexual-social sphere is at work there.
It is 300 people who will come for culture, not 10,000. In the end, less management, money, everything dies out.
I have fans; the main thing is not to betray them, not to spoil what I have earned.
In my young life I painted such art that one collector had it hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end with.
Concepts are often mixing these days.
People say: spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumerism, it is "from another opera."
I am a man of yesterday's culture. I grew up on examples of artists who lived poor and died in poverty, refused money for painting.
This is my culture.
Kirill, what is St Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an official for culture.
No one can be involved in culture.
Under the right rulers everything was different. Kings may not have understood culture very well, but they understood that they needed to stick with the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow right now.
Here in St Petersburg, there are people who could be experts, but they are pushed to the side, because more advanced experts are needed, who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them.
Judgement calls are what survive now.
Even Erart, but they are different because they believe that we do not accept all modern art.
What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, Moscow has much more culture, there is much more bedrock there.
It is hard for art to grow on rocks.
We need cultural bedrock, but we now have more writers than readers. This is wrong.
In Europe, many interesting people go to art exhibits, concerts.
Here this layer is thin.
We need to make art fashionable as it was in the beginning of last century.
The project is supported by the St. Petersburg grant.
Give birth space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or an asteroid sighting.
Caravans of cosmic ships with humans on board leave for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the question is how to propagate our race in weightlessness or on that replacement planet?
I think choice is small.
There are only two actual planets that can be explored even hypothetically.
Venus and Mars, says Senior Researcher of P.K. Shternberg State Astronomy Institute (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin.
The conditions on Mars are more appropriate for life than on Venus.
Life is possible at high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
Knowledge of space reproduction began with flora.
Half century ago, experiments were run on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from earth counterparts.
Then, insects were bred in orbit, small fruitflies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how an embryo develops in weightlessness.
We get a very normal chick.
It then begins.
The problem is related to the fact that this chick needs support, needs to get on its feet and start moving.
Following no support, chicks started tumbling around in disorder.
After 10 hours, the newborns experienced complete atrophy of instincts.
Chicks did not react to light and sound.
The problem was that they simply died after four days.
Once we bred chicks there, and then stopped, because it is impossible to work with them there.
The last biological "mini-ark" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, experiments will continue.
However, only same-sex beings will be on the Bion bio-satellite.
There was an experiment with rats, who were sent to space with foetus.
In principle, there was nothing extraordinary there.
This was on biosatellites, but again it was a singular experiment and such research is needed.
After landing, the cosmic rats had babies.
It is difficult to solve the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It is not easy.
Animals simply cannot follow their sexual instinct when they are out of their familiar environment.
In principle, people, unlike animals, can.
Homo sapiens have abstract thinking, and are able to create a fitting emotional background.
Such experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
Women have been flying to space for 50 years.
The most risk was for Tereshkova.
The most valuable thing for humanity is the human body.
Our Seagull left and nobody could tell if she would be OK after flying to space.
If she will be able to give birth after this flight.
Nobody answers this question, says rocket and space industry veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only one year after flying to space, the first woman in space Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The child’s father, Andrian Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who went into orbit two times and even worked in open space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, very few cosmonauts who were OK and had healthy children after long flights.
However, it is dangerous even for orbital flights, says pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the USSR, Hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
However, humans need to explore some new avenues in biotechnologies, protection from radiation, and creating artificial gravity.
Hydro-laboratory of CPK - mandatory phase of training for a flight.
Here, cosmonauts practice skills of working in open space in zero gravity conditions.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water is a foreign medium, although comfortable, for infants it is a native element.
Small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean.
There is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in the womb, and it is easier to get used to water after that.
In principle, it is logical, since only two weeks pass from birth to the first bathing.
Very little time to forget something, says Marina Aksenova.
In other words, if for a newborn weightlessness is more natural, a woman needs gravity, earth's pull.
Stomach and pelvic muscles usually quickly degenerate in weightlessness; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced.
However, let’s assume that childbirth stimulators will work out.
Maybe she will push out the baby in a special room.
"Then what?" - asks Valery Poliakov about this non-trivial issue.
The other hand, a baby also needs artificial gravity.
When a body does not feel the earth's pull, it does not form the skeletal and muscular system.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit into a special loading suit for training, as they do with adults.
The only thing he will have to survive is what he needs to survive.
However, this experiment, which we will go for by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to bringing a handicapped, completely unadapted human to earth, says Pestov.
For now, birth of children in space is only a theory.
Then, with time, it will become reality, when earthlings will travel to a far away planet in their ships, and it will become the home for their offspring, born in space.
NKU Head: Svarc System audit has failed because of politicians.
The Czech Republic has sound control bodies and good legal standards when it comes to public contracts, but it lags behind in its application.
This was told by Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office (NKU) in an interview for Aktualne.cz.
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing in the current situation.
Similar conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from Czech and German auditors.
As an example of improper practice, they cite Petr Necas' approach to the so-called "Svarc System."
The Prime Minister recently claimed that the ODS will not be burdening business owners with its checks - so is it forbidden or allowed?
The Law must be set out one way or another and if it prohibits something, even the Head of the Government cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce it.
At the audit committee's meeting in the House of Deputies you spoke about a joint project between Czech Republic and Germany, within which public contract legislation was compared.
What exactly was this about?
This is about parallel auditing, which we started around two years ago.
This is about how European legislation governs the handling of public contracts, followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice.
The audit is still in progress, and although the audit is yet to be complete, some interesting differences have become apparent - in general terms, our legislation may be even more concise and complete, but the practice is in some aspects better in Germany.
This confirms that creating more concise rules is not enough, and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws.
What does this project actually help you with, and what do you think its outcome will bring?
This kind of joint audit could help to curtail efforts to specify our law, to reduce and perfect boundaries, when it does not have such positive impact.
Economy is acquiring the required thing at a reasonable (which is not always the lowest) price, so that profiteering and possible criminal proceedings may be prevented.
However, just because we have reduced the order limits does not mean something will be acquired.
The system may get overloaded with paperwork, and those who wish to look for loopholes in it will be able to take advantage of it far more easily than if the limits were kept higher.
This is domestic problems about the practical application of public contract legislation.
How does the audit system work in Germany?
There is an office like the NKU, or is it differently organized?
The office functions like our NKU, and it has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently.
Strengths are also similar to degree, though Germany is federally organized, so the auditor courts are also at the Member State level - in this respect they may differ from our own.
The BRH can only audit federal money, known to us as state funds.
Public funds, which for us are administered by regional and municipal authorities, are audited by the federal courts of auditors there.
If they have a more straightforward legislation, is it more straightforward than ours?
Overall, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data, but it cannot be said that Germany is better in every aspect.
It may be because they have better enforcement?
It is certainly not true, but I prefer not to make such comparisons.
It should be added that even in an exemplary country, they face a whole range of problems.
If that were not the case, they would not gain anything from working with our office, would they?
Looking back to domestic legislation, what did the amendment to public contracts legislation mean for your office, and is it already felt?
The period since the amendment came into force has been quite short, so it has not manifested in our audit work yet.
Since we conduct our audits post-mortem, a certain delay is taken into account.
The changes have only been observed in the preparedness process for future audits - we have launched our new "fiscal failure risk detection" system, with which we have processed over 14 000 public contracts and these have been analysed - that is where changes will clearly appear, because of the changed limits, the changed conditions governing selection processes, and so on.
The benefits of this legislation are either a benefit or a burden on the bureaucratic system?
I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, and I hope this will be confirmed.
The problem, which may arise here, is that the law becomes too restricted and will not be enforceable.
In previous rules, auditing parties were already bound by their audit provider (e.g. in regional operational programmes, the regional office) to the fact that every infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth restricting the law in that case?
I do not think this is the way.
The system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it, but not penalize those who make a mistake on a technicality that does not affect the final decision.
This kind of system will only increase pressure on bureaucracy.
How can we get out of this?
Then lets see where this dead end takes us.
The Prime Minister recently announced that the ODS will not be burdened by the so-called "Svarc System" - what does this mean?
Is the Svarc System prohibited or allowed?
The Law must be set out one way or another, and if it prohibits something, even the Head of the Government cannot prevent the work of its department, which is duty-bound to monitor and enforce.
The lawyer may say: "Let us change this law and relax it," but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there.
The law on public contracts has relatively strict rules about the formalities which must be followed - which is the right way to protect public tenders.
The other hand, it is a tragedy when the best offer is excluded on a technicality.
The Law will never be perfect, but its application should be just - this is what we are missing.
Highways are icy in places, but mostly passable.
In several Czech Republic roads are icy and snowy.
However, most roads are passable, with additional care needed in places.
Carlsbad region
In Carlsbad region, the roads have been usable this morning, but some places were icy and snowy.
The temperature has fallen to between five and ten degrees below zero, but it is expected to get warmer slightly during the day.
Since the region has started snowing, only a thin layer of snow remains in the lowlands.
Krusne Mountains have around 30 centimeters of snow.
In some locations there is limited visibility due to mist, according to the local highway service.
The R6 high speed motorway and main roads in the region are now usable without restriction.
However, safety is essential, for example, on bridges where the surface can be icy and slippery.
All secondary and tertiary roads are also passable, including mountain roads.
In some stretches of these roads there may be remaining freeze and compacted snow patches.
Above all, at higher levels, extra care should be taken while driving.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralove region
The risk of black ice on some roads in Eastern Bohemia may be a threat to black ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there may be a layer of compacted snow, according to the Road and Motorway Directorate.
The highway service is warning drivers against black ice, which may occur at higher altitudes in particular in Pardubice region.
Black ice may occur around Lanskroun, Usti nad Orlici, Policky, Svitavy, and Vysoke Myto, and particularly on secondary and tertiary roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads have been chemically treated around Svitavy.
Particularly snow is affecting the roadways in Krkonoz and Orlicke Mountains.
At higher altitudes, there is a compacted snow layer on the road around Rychnov nad Kneznou and Trutnov.
In Eastern Bohemia the day will be mostly clear to partly cloudy, and dry.
Temperature will be between minus three and plus one degree Celsius mostly, with a light wind.
Pilsen region
The roads in the Pilsen region have been usable this morning, with extra care needed in some places.
The morning will be frosty, with temperatures between three and nine degrees below zero.
Because of the existing snow and a further drop in temperature, some roads may be icy.
Drivers should expect mist in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
This information was reported by the region's highway service.
The D5 motorway is driving almost without restriction, but road services recommend extra caution between the 80th and 131st kilometre marks.
Most primary road surfaces are dry and frost-free.
South-Eastern areas of the Pilsen and Tachov regions may have icy patches.
Secondary and tertiary roads are wet, and may also have icy patches.
Drivers should be cautious, especially on less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc region
Drivers should expect snow slush on the road if heading to the higher parts of the Olomouc region.
It is the result of the chemical treatment carried out at Cervenohorkse sedlo and on the way to Videlsky Kriz.
Snowploughs were brought out by falling snow overnight, the Sumperk region, according to highway maintenance, got around three centimeters of snow.
Other parts of the region are mainly accessible with no restrictions.
In Sumperk region, snow has remained at the highest altitudes.
Drivers should expect snow slush at Cervenohorske sedlo in direction of Jesenik, the dispatch officer for the Sumperk highway service told CTK today.
They also made an outbreak overnight, and the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear and wet after the chemical treatment.
The Olomouc region's roads are usable without restriction, while in Sternberk area drivers should be careful in wooded areas, where road surfaces have remained wet.
Ust-Nal-Labem region, Liberec region
Since morning, snowploughs have reported several places that are difficult to pass in northern Bohemia.
Outside some snow-covered places, or some icy frost patches, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice in the Usti nad Labem region is also closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures remain below zero and roads are likely to remain snowy and icy. In the lowlands, particularly southeast of the Central Bohemian Uplands, roads are mostly dry.
No traffic holdups have been reported.
Icy frost patches have been reported in particular by road maintenance around Steti.
According to meteorologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day, clear night and freezing temperatures.
Conditions are expected on main sections of the I/13 road between Usti nad Labem and Liberec regions.
The closure of the Telnice to Kninice road was caused by bent tree branches, which were weighed down to road level by snowfall.
Simon Ornest: At the concerts we want a fusion of positive energy.
What is your opinion on the end of the world that might come in less than a month?
It is just another startler, which we like to latch on to.
The Tap Tap band tends to joke about it, which is often a joke, which might be the only band on earth that can draw enough positive energy to prevent or avert the end of the world.
In December you are even organising a unique series of three concerts against the end of the world.
How can you give our readers some details on this?
This is a national fund-raising event, which we have been planning for the past two years.
The opportunity to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar, due on 21st December at 11:10 a.m.
On the 20th of December, at 9pm, 3 concerts will take place in Prague, Brno, and Ostrava.
They will end around around the time when Kiribati Island in the Pacific, which is 12 hours ahead of us, reaches the end of the Mayan calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was probably my idea, later we worked on all details with our designer, Honza Augusta.
In addition to collecting enough positive energy to stop the end of the world, we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thought for the state of our planet when we hand it over to our children.
The end of the Mayan calendar is also a special range of unique items, shoes, t-shirts, and original keys to support our cause.
The Tap Tap band, together with other artists, recorded the so-called end of the world anthem, called "The End of the World is cancelled."
It is already well received on YouTube, will it figure at the fundraising concerts?
The grand finale is always a possibility, if the world is not already ending.
It will be sung by all the artists at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthem will also be featured in a unique live broadcast on Czech TV.
The words were written and the role of Jesus in the video clip was played by Tomas Hanak, Xindl X also plays in it...
How did you end up working with them?
We also collaborate with other Czech cultural figures, due to organizing many fundraising events and concerts...
We try to get them involved in these projects.
It turns out that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
Strengthening the wheelchair-accessible educational centre Studeo, which is now in its sixth year, in collaboration with the citizens association Tap from the Jedlicka Institute for the disabled.
Tutors come regularly to spend time with the Jedlicka Institute students and run activities they enjoy and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors, so we try to provide this for them in this way.
The construction project at the Jedlicka Institute is planned, which we can move into with this project.
Every concert involves the appearance of several bands and artists.
How do they select?
We have tried to build a programme for all ages, including children.
In Prague Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap and Jiri Suchy will appear.
More details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any more "bombastic events" in the future?
In May we will be making our first appearance in Prague Spring, so we will definitely be preparing a good lineup with some interesting guests.
Next year we would like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally - since we will be in the USA - would like to build in appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your international plans are not modest; you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is still a band composed of handicapped people.
How do you cope with these journeys in terms of logistics and organisation?
It is not as scary as it might seem.
We have five members in electric wheelchairs, which must be transported in the luggage area; we also have to carry around a lot of luggage and instrument cases...
However, we have so far managed it without problems, CSA and British Airways were well prepared for us, so much that I was quite surprised.
Even in Moscow, which we have just returned from, everything went smoothly.
The opportunity to compare specific accessibility issues, public attitudes to disability and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg and other places where everything works better than here, we have just seen that in the East everything is still in its beginnings.
Moscow is a bit more inaccessible than Prague, and it still remains unusual for a person in an electric wheelchair to travel around the city centre on his or her own.
Obvious things such as giving wheelchairs priority in lifts are not common there.
However, citizens associations are emerging that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities.
However, where do we still lag behind more advanced countries?
There are many things, which we still lag behind on...
It is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people affected.
In London and Madrid it is entirely natural for people with serious handicaps to be independently out in public, and they can use the toilets, go to the museum, or wherever they wish.
The Tap Tap is less common in the world for large groups of people with disabilities to participate in social life, and in this respect we are a step ahead!
Respect or access is one thing, but it is only when we can become famous athletes, artists, actors, or politicians that things will really change.
Currently there are only exceptional cases, people who are strong-willed.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, but let’s look back a few years, what prompted you to form it?
Then I started my job as a tutor at the Jedlicka Institute, where I was surrounded by many young people who were interested in doing something.
Since I am a musician myself - among others I play the saxophone - I started a music club with a colleague.
With time, as our moderator Ladya Angelovic says, it has grown a little out of our control (laugh).
Your popularity has only started in recent years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that we have been helped by building ties to famous singers and by our proactive work on promoting the band.
We realized that work, which goes on unseen can be like it never existed.
The European Union provides funding to afford quality tutors, equipment and so on.
What was your goal to take The Tap Tap to such heights?
From the outset, I believed there was potential to do something differently.
Show business is filled with things, where one imitates the other.
It is logical in its own way; all new things are taken hesitantly and take a long time.
Unique things are few and I would dare to claim that Tap Tap is one of those.
The first impression on you is usually pity - it is a natural reaction...
The pity is simply wasted, because handicapped people are not abandoned and suffering beings, who need to be pitied.
The people who can fully live and blossom, assuming that they have the right environment for it.
I say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something, it is not only progress for them but for the whole of the community.
Has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a leader, as many people suggest?
If we want to achieve top class work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require a certain level of discipline.
I think this is to be expected.
Some people come to us with a romantic idea and their head in the clouds, and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend practice sessions and travel to concerts, their enthusiasm quickly disappears.
It is how it works everywhere, with every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap band currently has 20 members.
How many of them were present at the beginning of 1998?
Only one, Lady Angelovic.
We are open group, people come and people go, this is unavoidable.
The interest and drive will always be found at our door.
The event is taking place the day before the end of the world is expected, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9pm.
The venues will be Praha Incheba, Brno Fleda, and Ostrava Plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other Czech artists.
The three cities will be joined by a televised link-up at the end of the event to a united rendition of The Tap Tap's anthem "The End of the World is cancelled"
The goal of the concert is to raise funds to equip the STUDEO multi-functional wheelchair accessible learning centre at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the sum of 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years go free, tickets are available from Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Cosmos.
The European Space Agency’s Council of Ministers approved Poland as the twentieth member of the agency, following Czech Republic, which became a full fledged member of the agency on 12th November 2008.
Poland started close cooperation with the ESA in 1994, and in the following years has participated in a series of agency projects.
The path to space had started much earlier.
Polish boffins dedicated their time to space flight even before the Second World War, but were not always met with understanding.
A Sternfeld lecture in Warsaw's astronomy observatory on 6th December 1933, presented ideas on his pioneering work Entry into Space.
The thoughts of the young engineer (born 1905) left his audience cold, and years later Sternfeld remembers that only Dr Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 for his work Entry into space, Sternfeld received the Robert Esault-Pelterie and Andre Louis Hirsch prize in France.
The above mentioned Dr Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a strong promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
The author published hundreds of articles in Polish journals, and wrote a series of scientific books on these subjects.
Gadomski became a world-known promoter of astronautics and his contribution was, especially, recognised when a crater on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
In 1925 Poland had already built a handcar with a rocket engine.
However, both the project's designer and project details are unknown.
The rocket was not even clear, whether it was designed to start the handcar or slow it.
Information about this rail track is only known from press articles of the time.
In 1933 the Polish artillery started their engagement in flying bombs.
The research was carried out by the Weapons Technology Division in collaboration with Prof. Mieczysław Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzycki.
From the documents, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
The advance of the German army interrupted the research.
In 1937, a photoelectric homing rocket designed by engineer Rohozinski appeared in the trade press, and in the following year The Rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket-bomb was published.
Both projects were destined for military use of rocket engines.
Early in the War, all projects for military use of rocket technologies were coordinated by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Board (Tymczasowy Scientific Board) that coordinated all work.
The Board was appointed in 1937, but after two years of activity they started their operations with the start of the War.
More work devoted to astronautics was published in Poland after the War thanks to the Polish Aeronautics Company (Polish Aeronautics Association).
The first reference to the company figures is in November issue of the magazine Problems in 1954, in which four detailed articles on astronautics are published.
In one of them, by Prof. Subotowicz, the establishment of a company which would focus on astronautics.
The time was when there were already projects for artificial satellites and cosmic research was a new sector.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Aeronautics Company (PTA) sought entry to the International Aeronautics Federation (est. 1951), and by autumn the PTA was already a full member.
In the following year the first PTA Chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) was appointed Deputy Chairman for the International Aeronautics Federation.
The Chief Secretary of the Ministry of Health served in this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA played a major role in the success of meteorological rockets RM (Meteorologiczna Rakiety), which became the first Polish rocket to allow scientific research.
The first RM-1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch occurred on 10th October 1958.
The rocket, with a ceiling of 1800 metres, measures around 80 cm in length and weighs about 5 kg.
The improved RM-1A version was constructed and in summer 1959 launch tests for the two-stage RM-2 rocket were initiated in the Bledowsky Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres in length and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next development model was designed for real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds.
The research was stopped in 1962.
The successor to the RM rocket type was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two stage rocket with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models were developed (named Meteor-1A, -1B, and -1C), which differ in the room available for scientific apparatus.
Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three models was 37km.
In 1965 and 1968, Meteor-2 was developed in the Aeronautic Institute, with its first launch tests in October 1970.
Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg, and was capable of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km.
Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
Poland's admission to COSPAR in 1960 should be mentioned, as well as the appointment of a national COSPAR board two years later.
Poland also participated in the Interkosmos space programme for space research on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmos after Vladimir Remkov.
Removeing public works legislation is not the solution.
The Constitutional Court abolished the law on public works.
The resolution caused lively public debate.
It will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented financial systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
It means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause is the free trade and completely unregulated movement of private capital together with uncontrolled financial speculation.
The significant labour cost differences (salaries) cause pressure on prices.
The basic principle is that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods, the rug is pulled under the competition's prices to capture more market share and thus increase its own profits.
On a wider scale, this means most businesses must move production abroad, import cheaply from abroad, or close down.
Since private capital is not bound by social responsibility, and therefore not by the unemployment it causes, the social costs borne by the state must always increase.
The whole situation is fueled by the complete lack of willingness to pay taxes, which would reduce the economical and social harm caused by the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that no need for actual statistical data.
The ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations, where the State in these countries is forced to enter the mutual competition, aiming at artificially reducing the social standard of its own citizens to attract foreign investment.
In other words, governments stake their own citizens because of private capital while ignoring the social standards drop.
This occurs mainly in amendments to existing law.
The aim is to economically force domestic population to accept prices dictated by private capital, especially in terms of salaries.
One hand, this economic system of force, in case of long-term unemployment, and on the other hand restricted employee rights in the work place.
This results in growing poverty and an increasing gap between poor and the rich.
In Germany there are already a host of food hand-out centres for poor people who cannot feed themselves on their own wage.
The number of these people is now in the millions.
In order to improve the competitiveness of the German economy, properly employed people receive such a salary that the State needs to top it up to the minimum wage.
This was revealed in the case of auxiliary staff in the Bundestag.
The austerity measures for all the southern EU states will probably lead to the same situation, where people are forced to emigrate as it was in the 19th century, or to live on starvation wages on the edge of society in hopes that the country will eventually see some foreign investment.
This is the point where we have to ask where this may come from?
If it is to come from other EU states, then poverty is shifting from one country to another, or it will not come anywhere, because Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian, and African labour is still at a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theory and the Media repeatedly claim that the State may not participate with capital in its own economy, and that controlled economy leads to economic ruin.
Private capital persistently insists on the viewpoint that State must not intervene in the economy.
Thereupon, we should ask ourselves whether private capital has no influence, or whether it actually leads politics and thus the whole country for its own selfish ends.
Here, the answer must be yes.
The proof is the existence of the almost omnipotent, and in all states, omnipresent lobby.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting through corruption, through mutual benefits and legislation, where almost everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany the situation is such that state ministries, through lack of financial resources, contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are mainly connected to industry.
These laws are then approved in the Bundestag.
Real power is not from the people as Western constitutional structures claim, but from strong financial organisations that look after their own interests.
The evidence is clear that liberally-orientated democracies will quickly reach a situation, as Appian describes in his work on the Roman Republic Crisis in the time of Cesar and Pompei:
With bribery, illegal acquiring of benefits, and with stones or swords.
..."corruption was rife and unhindered, and people would vote for a result that was bought" .. "There was a debate about the only answer to this terrible situation being autocracy, and an energetic man should be elected.."
The conclusion, just as in antiquity, the current society is built on uncontrolled tendency for personal gain without regard to the interests of the whole of the community.
Private capital in its present state is not able to understand the interests of the whole of the community.
The outcome is now, as was then, an unprecedented decadence of the elite with no further reforms being tried.
The cause of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should be sought in misguided liberalization of the economic system in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The current state of affairs, when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude, can expect its next cycle.
The most tragic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, humanitarian and social disasters, which we are already witnessing, as well human rights crimes as we know from ancient and modern history.
The abolition of the public works law is not the answer, at least not in the long term.
The Czech Republic will be forced to pursue ways to reduce the population's living standards.
This pattern is thus systemic.
The targeted political and social reforms are targeted, which strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, increase the people's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favor of the state.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"Nothing comes from violence and nothing ever can," from Sting's Fragile, where one of the main verses from the refrain is "Let us forget how fragile we are."
If my children do not want war, there would be no war.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza strip has always generated a lot of reaction.
Some believe in Israel, arguing it has the right to self-defense, and Palestinians are portrayed as terrorists, while others support the Palestinians, claiming that genocide is committed against Palestinian Arabs, and that Israel is a terrorist state.
However, I do not want to dwell on who is the transgressor and who is the victim, because today's Israelis, including self-governing territories, are born into the current political situation and did not live through the start of the violence.
Following the scenes, I would like to offer the reader a peek behind the scene, a look at who most importantly is serving on this small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my thoughts are supported by available historical facts, and others are based on my own understanding of who is the main source of events in modern history.
Human history is first a matter of power struggle.
Every era we can find Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not quite clear is whether these people chose their path independently or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions towards a pre-calculated goal.
The world is wealthy in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes cannot occur in one generation.
The most important family in these astronomical rich families is the Rothschild family.
No much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first news agency (Reuters) they bought in the 90s of the 19th century was to prevent their name from being associated with high crimes, which always appeared in their background and always meant securing power, increasing wealth or both.
The majority of the stake in most central banks in the world is their holdings in most central banks, and against the countries where they do not have a stake they are either waging or preparing for war (before the assault on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after Iraq it was 5, after the fall of Kaddafi 4 remain, but in the meantime Russia submitted its central bank to Russia).
Whoever tried to defy this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to Rothschild Bank of America, and during the Civil War he started to issue his own (that is state-issued money) and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre.
Jefferson began issuing his own money and wanted to close the Fed (Federal Reserve), and was killed in 1963.
Their thirst for global power led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three-world-war plan by the 33rd degree freemason, Albert Pike.
The first war was to remove the large monarchic state bodies in Europe, second was to remove colonial rule, and the third was to create one universal faith (ecumenism is a weakened appetiser for this solution), and the last is the seizing of absolute power.
The method, which the group of wealthy families with the Rothschilds leading the way, is the instigation of crises, followed by the offer of a solution (order ab chao - order from chaos).
The solutions are false, and always lead to worse situation (vide establishment of the Fed, so that the 1907 crisis would not be re-occurring).
Then, having succeeded in assassinating Ferdinand, the Austrian heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia with the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly, militarily and economically unsubstantiated, with German capitulation (the war was no longer needed to destroy tsarist Russia) and Austria-Hungary was subsequently dismantled.
The financial and political players allowed the creation of a latent conflict situation by giving Germany huge war reparations, thereby creating a multi-racial Czech Republic with a strong German minority to play the role of a fifth colony after the war was ignited.
The Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, a branch of which aimed at building the Jewish State, seeking an area of historic Judea, Jerusalem, to be its capital (the Return to Zion).
The above mentioned Balfour Declaration formed the basis for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, where the first conflicts started with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
The World War II started, and Hitler broke free from the leash, which international bankers were holding him on, or if his actions were all part of the plan, is difficult to determine, but the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the foundation for world acceptance of the Jewish State.
Israel was officially formed in 1948, and just as the war reparations for World War II were laid on Germany, the announcement of the State of Israel became the hotbed of the third war.
If the international bankers succeed, the Jewish Nation, as with the first, will be the front line victims, now together with the Arabic - or more generally, Muslim - population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country but also internationally (just look at how strongly people are divided into supporting and opposing Israel).
What is the wrong-doer and who is the victim in the Palestine-Israel conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence, while everything started from the greed of few and their lust for global power?
Here, we must differentiate between general population and their leaders, because, just as in Israel, international banks introduces their own selection of candidates for people to vote for.
Current Prime Minister Netanyahu 'the hawk' is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything to promote war with Iran, which would, due to its membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, ...), lead to a greater threat of global conflict and through its control of the Hormuz Strait, where 20% of the world's oil must sail, lead to the destruction of the world's economy.
What light are these words, which was written by David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order.”
The New World Order in their eyes is one of master and slave.
A world where the rest of human population serves the luxuries of a handful of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip, which makes their existence completely subjugated.
Then he ordered everyone, small and great, rich and poor, to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, and if he has insight, he can calculate the number of the beast.
It is man's number. His number is six hundred and sixty six.
Argo: When things are at their worst - call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamic student demonstrators took over the American Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats.
Their release was in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the USA, which had actually supported his regime for several decades.
The American administration could not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the Shah overboard, because this would seriously jeopardize the trust of other allied countries.
The release of the prisoners in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime, was unsuccessful.
This was a blow to the United States’ prestige, which later compounded by the fiasco of trying to free the prisoners by force.
The incarcerated diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations with the Algerian government.
Their ordeal caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iran feelings in home.
The Iran crisis significantly influenced Jimmy Carter's loss with Ronald Reagan in 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, directed by Ben Affleck, recounts one episode in this story, which brought America a small victory.
After the embassy was seized, six employees escaped.
After some peripheral situations, they ended in the Canadian ambassador's home.
The CIA, in collaboration with Canada, managed to get them out of Iran, thanks to an extravagant cover story - they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew, surveying locations for a sci-fi blockbuster.
A combination of genres
The plan, developed by "exfiltration expert Tony Mendez, required the assistance of Hollywood.
The story to be believed, the film project was reported on in specialist magazines, press conferences were organized, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were for a long time secret, and the film draws on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique mix of genres.
On the other hand, there is a realistic political thriller, and at the same time a "caper movie" with small victories and double crossing - another example would be Ocean's Eleven.
The mood varies in the film - on one side, sharp documentary-style sequences in Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic photos from the time, relating to the same events portrayed in the film - no major differences).
Otherwise, lighter sections from Hollywood, often filled with irony and a little exaggeration.
Then there are scenes from the CIA headquarters and other agencies - men in suits discussing the situation around meeting tables, in office corridors, over the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in extraordinary style.
The deemed actor has become a respected director, and his acting is no longer the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third big screen movie, followed by his dark crime movie Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller The Town (2010).
The first picture of Affleck is also not set in Affleck's hometown of Boston.
The atmosphere of different locations is one of the characteristics that took his previous films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck shows it in Argo, where Tehran is "featured" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film are taken in the street, in reconstruction of real events - the opening sequence of the embassy siege is very lucid, creating a sense of confusion and surprise, which floods in as history suddenly takes a turn.
The same effect is achieved by Affleck and his team in the fictitious scene (the fake staff at the Tehran bazaar).
More action in too many places
The director had to tackle the issue that the story is not offering many nail-biting scenes for the film.
What is there, is well done, with occasional embellished scenes to reality - these do not all look so elegantly (the scene where a looming crisis is prevented at Tehran airport by a phone call in America followed by a chase on the runway seems quite far-fetched).
Argo's strength is its divergent nature, which is caused by the need to show too many events in too many places.
The assistants are very interesting, and they are not the only ones in this film.
Affleck's film loses the dramatic pull a little, but it is a film that can be watched with reasonable interest, its production and retro-style are evocative of thrillers from the 70's.
It is not really captivating.
As a reminder of the particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views on all-controlling secret services, this will do.
Rules for blowing up balloons, for bananas and a circus
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank charge, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or proposal from the EU."
They were prompted by the recent news, where the EU plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of Europe's largest companies.
The most recent examples of absurdities include the recent decision by the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
In the past women were favoured in life insurance prices, because they represent a lower risk for insurers.
Other unbelievable ideas from the EU can be nominated by any person until the end of the year.
The actual vote will take place until the end of February 2013.
The most controversial EU regulations include the mandatory addition of bio-ingredients to fuel, which consequently threatens the environment, or the regulation on size of chicken cages, which significantly increased egg prices this year.
The ban on the use of the term "spreadable butter" and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously been criticised.
First rate bananas measure 14 centimeters.
The Union's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by state or group of state interests (just as the Czech Republic is promoting the demands of its banks under threat of veto).
The lobby's interests were, for example, that high quality bananas should measure at least 14 cm in EU, and not have "anomalous curvature."
The European Commission defended itself, saying that it was only harmonising existing disjointed national standards, which complicated trading.
Regulations on fruit and vegetables have been softened by the EU despite opposition from some countries, referring to food waste caused by the existing directives.
One possible winner in the poll may be the last year's EU regulation which requires inflatable balloons to be sold with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision.
Here, the EU pointed to an American research, which reported that, among other toys, balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age using party blowers.
Strange ideas are created at home too.
Another absurd rule is the rule relating to individual European officials - everyone in the EU who has an official position may not use the term Macedonia due to its sensitive topic for Greece, and instead the acronym FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) should be used.
The Bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the Liberal Economist Association, Laissez Faire, also featured, apart from the above mentioned absurdities, such as the Union's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in a EU member state.
The EU stipulated the maximum volume of food provisions, which may be present in the CR on the day of our entry into the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded the permitted volume of mushroom preserves, which incurred high penalties.
The poll organizers were also impressed by the idea of paying countries because they do not have a coastline, or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding.
This idea was not from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are handicapped because we do not have the sea.
Agriculture minister Jaroslav Palas (CSSD) told the European Union in autumn 2004.
The evidence for his argument was that there had been good harvest of cereals, and due to the so-called buy-out interventions, the state's warehouses were full and the state was forced to export.
The Czech Republic is far away from a port, so the EU should be paying us hundreds of millions of Euros.
The European Commission finally met the CR halfway by organising a tender for cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
funding to foreigners was offered to foreigners by the Ministry for Regional Development's minister, Pavel Nemec (US-DEU), specifically for requests for funding from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre legislation is the exception
Regulations may well be the target of criticism among Member States, but the EU's efforts at regulation, effective operation, and development of the Union merit recognition, according to several experts.
More important issue, according to experts, is the drawing of EU funds on projects that have little to do with strengthening European integration, but which was pushed through by Member States at a budget meeting.
Emotions flare among Czechs when, just as other Union countries, the CR must fight in Brussels for specific labelling on its traditional products, which is not always successful.
The Czechs fought for six years with the Germans and Austrians to protect the labelling of their Olomoucke tvaruzky, but the tuzemsky rum, which goes back to the 19th century, was renamed tuzemak by the manufacturers.
The term rum is only given to products distilled from cane sugar and not sugar beet.
Carlsbad sheep, Trebonsky and Trebonsky cattle, and Zatec hops have been added to the EU’s official list of registered products, alongside the world-renowned feta cheese and gorgonzola, German marzipan from Lubeck, and Parma ham.
The EU protection stamp can also be proudly shown on Pardubice gingerbread and Horicky tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I am an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how do people decide to run for President?
This is not about me being a senator or president.
If everything worked without problems, I would not be running for any post.
I cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past 20 years, thieves roaming around there and people's taxes and retirement age increasing.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
If I see something I do not like, I try to find a solution to change things.
Since I have already turned forty and I am an independent non-party man, I have no choice but to stand for senator or president.
You have already reached the Senate, but shortly after that you are taking off for the Castle.
Are you not turning back on those who voted for you in doing this?
I have been repeatedly talking about the Castle based on the results of the Senate elections.
Later I added that if I were elected as senator, I would be standing for president.
My goal is not the post, it is a tool to allow my vision to be realized.
The most effective influence and strongest mandate is needed.
The problem is not only that we swear in the pub or on TV, but that we trample anyone who wants to change things.
The Media add this, misleading the public, and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
Examples include I was allegedly bribing reporters, or I was allegedly an advisor of Jiri Paroubek.
Listen to your vision.
You set out on your Castle siege with a thesis on material and criminal responsibilities of politics, and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million.
You need to change the law for this.
As president you do not have this power, and only the Senate as a whole may propose laws.
How are you going to solve this?
If I advocated as a citizen for tour guide work to be a free trade, it was successfully carried through.
The problem is political squabble - when someone comes with a good idea from the left or right, it will deliberately be rejected, causing delays for the public.
As an independent non-party man I have a far better chance of gaining support from all parliamentary sides.
The advantage I hold is that without the political stigmatisation or dogma I can take what is best for our country from any side, and apply it.
Do you see yourself as a person from the right or left?
From Czech perspective, it seems to tend to place me to the left.
For me, it does not matter if it is a little to the left or right.
The important part for me is moving forward.
It is not about either left or right, I just want to bring people together.
I always support good public solutions, even if they are presented by the KSCM or the ODS, and, therefore, I will always oppose bad ideas.
You get angry when someone calls you a populist.
What do you not confirm with what you have stated?
When you make a company business plan, you also have some ideal goal and vision.
You try to get close to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I speak about are already working elsewhere or have been presented by experts.
With no support from the Parliament you will be left with just slogans.
You will not last long in politics with that.
If you walk among the public and talk with them you will succeed, say, in passing criminal and material responsibility?
I have no alternative.
I need to convince politicians, reporters, and the public to support me.
If I were elected president, I would not have a problem to arrange a live television broadcast, where I ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians, civil servants, and the Attorney General.
Then, as a case may be, they would need to explain why they did not want this.
When there is a strong figure to point out the issues, it just needs some pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, it was achieved thanks to public pressure.
I will say frankly that I am an amateur, I am not a genius or an intellectual.
I am looking for partners to share my opinions and vision.
I have just started out in politics, and I am looking for a majority support for my agenda.
I will try to make things progress, but if it does not work out, I will return to the private sector.
It sounds like Okamura is trying to save Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that alone I cannot achieve anything, so I have asked acquaintances if they would run for the senate.
I went to Radim Jancura, who declined due to his workload.
So I, at least, support investigative journalist Jana Lorencova.
I took my initiative, because people are really discontented, but now I have my doubts.
Sixty percent of people did not vote, and those who did mostly voted for the establishment.
In the Senate, only two independents, including me.
People have voted for a senate that will make it difficult to implement changes.
However, I will fight for my vision, e.g. direct election of mayors or regional council presidents.
Are you considering having your own party?
I have not considered it yet, because I have no time to verify that every party member has a clean background, nor the money to do it.
I have no money even for a presidential campaign, my transparent account holds only 20 thousand.
You have no money?
You are talking about financial disclosure, but what is yours like?
I estimate my private assets to be around 60 million.
In Prague I have land worth around 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, an art collection worth around ten million, a Aston Martin worth 3.5 million, a Skoda Superb worth a million, and I have a few million in my account.
Aston Martin is my dream as a child - I always liked James Bond, who loved to drive the car, was brave with women and also took on evil and villainy.
You drive an Aston Martin, have assets worth 60 million, but you have no money for campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic, but you are not keen to invest your own money in it.
This does not inspire much confidence.
I have no 15 million for a campaign.
Should I take out a loan?
I have already contributed 2.5 million to the campaign.
The fact that I do not have any sponsorship is evidence that no real interest in my programme is present.
I have no obligation to pay for my own campaign.
The expenditure on my campaign is mainly covered by my senator’s salary.
However, I could not live on it, for example, I could not pay for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I was only interested in making money, I would not be standing for election.
So you will still be in business to make money?
Do you not say you would be holding this on hold?
This depends on the rate of pay.
As I promised, my activities have been partially reduced.
Examples of my deputy are taking over as CEO of the travel agency in spring.
People want me to be a Samaritan, who saves the Republic.
But you must also live off something.
As a businessman, what would you usually make monthly?
Two hundred to 400 thousand, which I still do.
If I become president, I would end my business activity.

MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not limited to the head - drawing on the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg (literally “book mountain”). - 2 photos
The building is fun, looks futuristic and ultimately provides something interesting to look at.
The technical technician in a major firm based in the area commented: "It's a wonderful building. It's a wonderful building.
However, I wonder why people need another library in this day and age.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and eBooks.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily nowadays, or am I wrong?
Spijkenisse, a quiet town outside Rotterdam, which does not merit a visit, is a special record-holder.
The 80,000-resident municipality has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this almost alike situation, the decision was made many years ago to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the Euro notes as painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
The city fathers recognized that there is only one way to become master of statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas of MVRDV, a leading architect in Rotterdam, took the project with his usual composure, and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
Then, with the audience still looking at him with a smirk, the ignorant Maas started stacking his chosen props by order of size to form a pyramid, and finished his presentation with the words: "Dear Municipality!"
This is my suggestion for Spijkenisse Book Mountain - the so-called Bookenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million euro mountain has been lifted up.
It is part of a revitalisation project, which also includes an underground car park, a supermarket, and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses, totaling 50 houses.
The Bücherberg was awarded second place in the "Best Library of NL 2012" competition.
In addition, the project is also nominated for the National Wood Award 2012.
The faceless small-town retort, that until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would expect to find dairy plant, has been enhanced by a modern piece of architecture.
First and first of all, Spijkenisse now has its first public cultural building in its history.
The long journey to the book
First impression: the Eldorado of books under a cheese dome.
There is a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif, but the true joys of space and literature are revealed when footsteps are taken.
The interior space, glazed throughout, is bright and open, the fired clinker floors and the elegant street lights speak the unmistakable language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You are already looking for a park bench, a dog, and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
Traditionally book shelves run along the facade, and in the centre there is a large, dark space, which is usually unpleasant and impersonal.
We turned the classical spatial configuration on its head and turned the reading area inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is very well used: in the centre there are offices, Internet library, chess club, an environment centre and the central technical support room.
The most special feature is the black book shelves, which simultaneously act as wall cladding, parapets and railings for the stairway.
The appearance, feel and scent are foreign.
Architects and construction engineers often shake heads at the unknown construction materials.
”Here we wanted to work with recyclable materials,” explained Joop Trouborst, Project Manager for Spijkenisse, on request of the Standard.
Then one day we found a suitable waste product for agriculture, on a Frisian farm.
Many years, millimetre-thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and fields in Netherlands as a base layer.
It is cheap and saves time.
The thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk waste.
For the library, the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four-centimetre-thick boards.
Under heat, the so-called Landbouw plastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogenous and robust material that smells like a mix of new car smell and trainers.
After 105 steps you have reached the summit.
Then, after the 500-meter-long journey, you are rewarded in the Literature Café, not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
These provide atmosphere, but most importantly, control the air humidity in the literary mountain range.
New souls
'You would not believe it, but this building, despite the many glass panels, is a showcase project in the area of ecology'.
It is heated and cooled by geothermal heat.
The Bücherberg has a glass cover, but the sun only shines briefly into the interior, even on sunny days.
The broad, laminated wood glue beams positioned right angles to the glass facade provide shade and absorb most of the sunlight.
The indoor temperature is very pleasant.
The rest is taken care by full automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, initially a sceptic of the IT sector, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has also visited.
The same has TCM teacher, Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "long overdue soul."
The reason: At the inauguration last week, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his/her personal collection.
This was for time being to fill the gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently there are 70,000 items.
The concept has been successful.
The shelves are full to capacity.
"Nothing is worse than half-empty library," said architect Winy Maas.
Because of our invitation, every resident now has a certain bond with this new building.
Everyone knows that their book is part of the building.
Even if it is just for decoration.
MVRDV have successfully mastered the master discipline that specialist jargon calls identity formation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
However young and uneducated it may be.
This is ultimately a start point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
In the vote on the integration of Palestine, Germany abstained from voting.
Stephen Szabo, Expert in US-European relations, says that Berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle:
Berlin later abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, due to their special relationship with Israel, Germany must be careful.
It is not believed to support the American position either.
Germany wanted to show its independence - albeit without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting, when it came to setting up a no-fly zone.
This was ultimately implemented by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to adopt a clear position when it comes to important international affairs?
Yes, it does.
It has just reorganised its foreign policy, indeed moving away from a policy that was, so called, managed by the USA, in favour of a German foreign policy.
This situation is further agraved by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent and standardised policy.
The Germans thus find themselves caught between two fronts.
It is expected of them to play a more independent role, but this is something they do not usually do.
I believe that they are still finding their way in this role, but they are moving to a more normal foreign policy.
A similar foreign policy to that of France, or Great Britain.
What specifically does a "normal" foreign policy entail, from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to adopt international positions, independent of the USA or European partners.
The German foreign policy is based on economic policy, that is, by export and its relations with specific regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other major powers and Germany must protect its interests.
These economic interests have influenced their attitude to the Middle East conflict and their participation in the UN?
On the other hand, Germany has major revenue markets in the Middle East, and particularly in the Gulf States.
It is therefore important not to affront the public but also the elite in the Arab countries.
In any case, this plays a role.
However, I would not want to ascribe too much weight to this.
It does play a key role in Germany's considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the USA by refusing to vote on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA, a great understanding for the German position is growing.
It is not believed to be as dramatic as was the case in Libya.
Maybe it will even earn Germany some respect.
After all, it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be considered.
In Europe there are diverse opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The USA have a clear message in support of a veto.
There are differences between the USA and many European countries?
The American domestic policy has always been a barrier to these differences.
I think that secretly, the government under Obama actually has a great deal of understanding for the European situation.
However, due to the political situation here, the government is naturally unable to voice this position publicly.
It is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so wide as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is really not so enthused by Netanjahu's policy.
How can Germany reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that this is precisely what makes things so difficult for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and standardised European policy, which is currently not the case.
They are unable to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position.
This is exactly what they are doing with the Euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a key role in leading Europe towards a standardised European position.
This is a difficult task for Germany, given its relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive subject.
It is a clear understanding that Germany must play a more independent role.
Does Germany view itself as an important international player - does Germany actually want to play a lead role?
Does Germany still find leadership roles difficult?
Germany is still not used to it, the country continues to be uncomfortable and for obvious reasons, is still unable to play a more prominent role.
If we look at the Euro crisis, every time Germany takes a more prominent role, various anti-German feelings appear.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is actually the same old problem: one does not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this position, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the USA.
It must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
The USA’s influence on European politics is continually declining, but the EU is currently not feeling this gap.
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
If they do not like it, even if it is uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - life is!

"Brand protection" in China: Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese.
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren likewise.
However, what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a fullly officially registered brand in China, but one that has no relationship with the original companies.
However, it is still being protected, provided the actual creators of the names do not sue.
Even then it is unclear if they will have any rights.
The increasingly difficult way to protect foreign brands in China is Thomas Pattloch, lawyer in Taylor Wessing law firm, who specialises in copyright infringement in the Far East.
Every week a new case hits my desk.
All copycats require a few additional letters to register their brands.
Gucci simply becomes Lu-Gucci, Prada-Kny is registered in place of Prada.
Various German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as Puma.
Pattloch opens a file with registrations with the trademark office in Peking.
The 14 September 2010 a Chinese company copyrighted the brand Zegna DF Puma there, a alias that also helps to the name of fashion retailer Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well known.
In major cities there are multi-level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively.
Pattloch's cases are slightly different: on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office, fully officially, which is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This refers to women who latch on rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any wrongdoing.
”This harms business and we must fight against it,” says Pattloch.
The brand is watered down, its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is enormous.
The financial losses and process costs of the affected branches range into the million, especially in the case of highly expensive flagship products.
According to information from CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros annually, China is the third largest market for luxury items, and the fastest growing.
However, the elimination of dubious entries in the trademark registry is difficult, and costs a pretty penny.
The process can last for up to nine years, with no definite outcome.
Pattloch reports instances where the court discontinues cases, because after a long period of time the name to which the objection is being raised has become a "market reality."
If unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiator money for infringing on his trademark in China, said Pattloch.
Occasionally the law of the jungle prevails.
Celebrity cases also include graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently acquired Putzmeister.
Even today, the Chinese company is allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo-purchaser Geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the BMW logo, but the dispute was resolved and Geely was forced to change it.
Lacoste lost a suit in China against copycats from Hong Kong and Singapore, who used the famous crocodile looking in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any wrongdoing.
The CTMO trademark office in Peking does recognise that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to limited staffing and equipment.
In the past year, things reportedly "returned to normal" after this emergency situation regarding work flow.
The number of unprocessed appeal proceedings was reduced by 22 percent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be resolved in the office.
To remedy this is very expensive.
As is often the case in China, figures are quite significant.
In the past year, more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection were submitted to the CTMO, almost one third more than in 2010.
This is a record and China, for the tenth time, is the global leader in new trademark applications, according to the authority.
The same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks, totaling 5.5 million in number.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were received.
According to the average application costs on average 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
The cost of an application is often a higher cost than in the case of the German family business, Freudenberg.
More than seven years, the group has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans successfully managed to expose the company's illegal manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts.
The copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This is something we missed as family names cannot be protected in Germany, said Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board at Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office then also dismissed the Munich-based company's appeal.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was proven right, but the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day.
You must be extremely careful.
The matter is now pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the matter will be resolved and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he says: "The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs can be estimated, the company archive even visited century-old records to provide proof.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six figure in euros" as settlement.
This is a good example of how much this is worth to us.
The dangers in the Far East even threaten to spread back into Europe.
Particularly if imitators secure unprotected brands there.
Examples include China manufacturers wanted to register the Freudenberg label for shoes and leather in Germany.
This is a business sector that the group had long abandoned, but nonetheless managed to prevent registration.
"You have to pay extremely careful attention," says Wentzler.
Both he and Pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting business with China.
It is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights, but foreigners should register "everything that is in any way worthy of protection in China as well," said Wentzler.
Otherwise costs can be much higher than the registration fee.
In fact, if Freudenberg looses at the final hurdle of its trademark drama, they probably would have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name, explained Wentzler.
Alternatively we would be forced out of the market in the respective sector.
World AIDS day: Stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy.
The history of a link that goes beyond a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First, the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes and men's loafers try to find the beat on the parked floor, and quickly do that.
One two three four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano swell, beguil and haunt.
The 29-year-old conductor almost rises from his shoes as he brings the ensemble together with his smooth, yet wild gestures.
It is Monday evening and in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi Choir is performing a new song.
The fifteen singers, ages 23-69, range from human geneticists to the maintenance man.
"Om'Obani" is no longer a simple piece, with each voice having a different text, and in an extremely foreign language at that: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping others to help themselves
There are around 34 million HIV-infected people worldwide, according to the estimates of Unaids, the United Nations' programme to fight AIDS.
Of these, 23.5 million live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
Meanwhile, more than 40 percent of the population are HIV positive.
The Voices for Africa Association has found sponsorship in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of these attend secondary school.
For 15 or € per month you can become a sponsor.
This guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and warm meals every day in the Gogo Centre.
In Zulu, Imbongi means storyteller or worshipper.
In this region no one can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing it.
The choir has been practising songs in this foreign, 'soft' language for almost ten years, and now and then they return to where they originated: South Africa.
Another 8,733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the north-western Swaziland Kingdom lies the village of Esitjeni, which relies on the vocal power of the German choir.
Five percent are infected.
Around 2,000 people live there, some still in mud and straw huts, and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents, as they succumbed to HIV virus.
In Esitjeni you get a small warning of the illness that all Swaziland is suffering from: according to Unicef, the region has the highest HIV infection rates and the lowest life expectancy in the world.
Circumcision, which has been proven to reduce the risk of contracting the virus by half, is rarely practised in the population.
More than twenty percent of people in Swaziland have the virus, and dying in your mid-thirties is no longer rare.
The Choir visited the village in early 2005, but first and most importantly, the Imbongis saw many children on the street, without parental care but in practically everything else: food, clothing, education.
With no school leaving certificate, no opportunities are available, especially in poor countries.
The initial promise of individuals to send a child to school and allow him/her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year.
However, only one year later the choir established the "Voices for Africa" Association, which has since been looking after the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni on a professional level.
Sexually transmitted infections.
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
HIV, human papilloma viruses, genital herpes and hepatitis are common STIs.
Crabs and scabies are parasitic STIs.
Who are main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhoea occur mainly in men who have sexual intercourse with other men.
Robert Koch Institute believes that at least four in five of all syphilis cases in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis, gonorrhoea and human papilloma viruses are frequent sexually transmitted diseases.
The HIV spread among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low, but around 20 percent of newly acquired HIV cases occur in this group.
among young people chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In this country human papilloma viruses are also frequently found in young people.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are not identifiable.
Robert Koch Institute reports that syphilis infections have gone up from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of newly contracted HIV cases has declined since 2007.
In 2011 there were around 2,700 cases.
This is around one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate sexually transmitted disease?
Infective diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, discharge, lower abdominal pain and bleedings or cysts.
However, they often cause no pain or any other symptoms, thus remaining undetected.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms reduce contraction risk, but they do not offer 100% protection.
This is because occasionally, the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted via smear infections and close bodily contact.
The first and most important experts recommend that people with frequent sexual partners undergo regular examinations.
If diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences are avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and no least the funds that the choir raises across Germany, the money all adds up.
Since the start of the campaign we have sent around 200,000 euros to ESITjeni, according to Annette Lennartz, Chairman of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured and assertive woman, manages the money from Germany.
The mother ensures that the children have good accommodation, e.g. with one of their grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them, providing them with a roof over their head and making sure the children get to their school classes punctually every day in their school uniforms.
Anyone who has no family left, takes a ride to the shelter with Khanyisile, a single woman who earns the same salary from the association as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has established a sewing school,built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organisation, PSI, organised for many in the village to be tested for HIV.
This is not to be taken for granted, as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the country, and the best way to keep things under wraps is if people are dead.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is a very taboo subject," said Annette Lennartz.
This is actually strange for a country with 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III., is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy in place of democracy.
Other factors include the fact that HIV virus has spread quickly over the past decade can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle.
Other factors include the large number of migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
The containers are free, but they are rarely used.
The culture prescribes otherwise - flesh to flesh.
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels through Southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs of melancholy, fight spirit, confidence and black self-esteem that many from the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people, who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only moral and joy, but some grim-faced border soldiers even shed a few tears.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their sponsor children.
The small village is almost impossible to find on a map, but it is more than well known in the Valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, that's where the light is," say the people there.
If you make the 8,733 kilometre flight back to Heidelberg, to visit the stomping singers in their rehearsal room, you will see that the light is there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
It is thought that the ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency, NASA, has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The planet is close to the sun, but it does have frozen water, as shown in three studies published on Thursday in the specialist magazine Science.
Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice cover in the region of the planet that remains permanently in shadow.
This is thought to be east 30 centimetres and possibly up to 20 metres thick.
The water is believed to be from comets or possibly also asteroids that impacted Mercury.
However, no one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said Chief Scientist for the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
The findings could help explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other regions of the solar system.
The most common unknown to most Earth's inhabitants, there are probes, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix, deployed to research the depths of the universe.
Their images are sometimes transmitted to Earth: small peepholes into the infinite expanse.
This image is from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dust planet Ceres.
Similar to Pluto, which orbits around the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.
This image section from an infrared recording by Spitzer telescope shows a family portrait of millions of stars: the oldest stars are seen as blue dots, while the newest stars are easier to identify than the pink-coloured "newborns" in the star delivery room.
This star-forming region - rather unromanticly called W5 by scientists - was discovered by Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light years away.
This shimmering glow of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material, emitted by the star in the process of dying.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years away from Earth, new stars are created from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope shot this photo of the galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also known as "Seven Sisters", can be seen with the bare eye at night.
With the telescope, the colours really come into their own.
In this infrared photo, Helix Nebula looks at the observer like a red eye.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
It's similarity to the continent resulted in this Nebula acquiring the title 'North America'.
A combination of normal and infrared photography produced the spectacular colouring.
This baby star can only be captured in its full beauty using Spitzer telescope's infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: How these occur are the most important puzzle in astronomy.
The remains of a Saturn moon may be the remnants of a moon of Saturn, which disappeared without traces 4.5 billion years ago.
The most significant and sharpest picture from the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the colouring, spiral galaxies can become genuine art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, some thousand light years away.
The name Trifid is a Latin word that means divided into three parts, as dark dust strips divide the core of the birthplace of stars into three parts.
Ophiuchus constellation has reported signs of a cosmic collision: 400 million light years from earth, the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards each other, ready to collide.
This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the M83 spiral galaxy.
Everyone who doesn't like technical abbreviations may prefer to call it the Southern Catherine Wheel.
The photo taken by Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cepheus constellation.
The nebula, 1,400 light years away, is composed of particles of dust that are ten to one hundred times smaller than standard house dust.
This image was created from the X-ray images captured by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years away from the Earth.
This group of galaxies, named Arp 273, was pictured for NASA by the Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This star nebula is home to the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This 'star cradle' continues to produce new youngsters.
Likewise, this star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, continually produces new baby stars - 5000 light years away from Earth.
In this bright shining galaxy with one small black hole, no dust is present - only gas.
The theory is that it only appeared shortly after the Big Bang, when the universe was mainly composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - even before Galileo Galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later.
Since then, the mirrors in optical telescopes have become increasingly large and the insights they provide increasingly profound.
The Hale telescope in Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world’s largest telescope.
The mirror, shown in the image, had a diameter of five metres.
Arizona, USA, is home to the Large Binocular Telescope.
It enables views of space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Canarian satellite telescope on the island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the South African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to reduce costs.
In spite of this it reaches a diameter of around 11 metres.
The disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method is that the telescope is securely clamped at its inclination and its movement is restricted.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed angle of inclination.
What sets it apart: the high light-gathering capacity.
This - despite its comparatively low mirror diameter - even meets the world's largest reflector telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico) researchers can listen for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) every computer owner can be of help, by making his/her processing capacity available.
View of European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is home to the Very Large Telescope, which lives up to its name.
With its total four mirrors, the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum.
Similarly to be located at the ESO Observatory in Chile, the European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned.
The main mirror will be a full 42 metres long and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements.
However, images are not expected until 2018 at the earliest.
In 2007, the two Keck telescopes at the Hawaiian volcano, Mauna Kea, were the largest in the world.
The two mirrors have a diameter of ten meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which alongside the Keck telescopes can look to the heavens with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
The new telescope is also planned to be built on the Mauna Kea, with a mirror diameter of 30 metres.
Here you can marvel at an artist's impression.
However, the most important insights into space are provided by the Hubble space telescope.
Since 24 April 1990 it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009 the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extra-solar planets, especially for those that may be inhabitable.
The mission started on 2 February 2011 and NASA announced that 1,235 planetary candidates have been identified since the mission began.
The image documents the final launch preparations on the Kepler space telescope.
James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space on board an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the Big Bang.
Scientists are believed to have ice also at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data supporting this as the Messenger orbits around the planets much closer to the north pole.
For years, radar measurements have indicate that there is ice on Mercury.
Messenger probe was launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury.
Butter daily - and live to 168 years of age
In Southern Azerbaijan, many people reach biblical ages.
There is even a longevity museum.
A search for evidence in a country where 97 years old is still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages that are almost biblical.
There is even a longevity museum.
A search for evidence in a country where 97 years old is still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysh Mountains can be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus rolls through narrow street streets, past densely wooded hills, raging rivers and simple farmhouses.
All is green and lush - you can be forgiven for thinking you were in the Black Forest.
This is the deep south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is just a few kilometres away.
This is the home of the Caucasian people, the Tlysh, who are unknown to know much except that they speak perfect Persian and Azeri and live long lives.
Final stop is Lerik.
The small town is filled with overpowering Soviet architecture, which does not match the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Azerbaijanis rarely visit, as the journey from the capital city, Baku, is too long.
The route takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, as too much of the route is a single track.
The wealth of the country that is acknowledged by its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet reached here in the province.
Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
'Baku became famous in May due to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year we are having a festival to celebrate the oldest people in the world', she added.
The Director of the Museum of Longevity is most likely to be the only one of its kind in the world.
The lives of eight dozen Talysh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136 he took another child.
The unrivaled star of the museum is Shirali Muslimov, who lived to 168 years.
However no birth certificate exists to confirm this.
The longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years.
”He was born in 1805, here in the region, and died in 1973,” explains Fatulayeva.
The man married three times and had 23 children, and is believed to have fathered another daughter at the age of 136.
So did Shirali Muslimov miscalculate his age by a couple of decades?
The researcher Rembrandt Scholz, who is a researcher on aging at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of people living to impressive ages in Central Asia.
Very elderly people are also found in China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, and a very large number of extremely old men are also found in Sardinia.
However, lack of documentation means no scientific proof of age, particularly as there are no birth registers.
Delicious butter by glass every day
However, the fact remains that the people of the region surrounding Lerik reach biblical age with a remarkable regularity.
There are currently 20 individuals older than 100 years of age.
How do so many very old people live in the south?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Muguzadeh explains this as being due to the special Talysh genetics.
In contrast, Museum Director Fatulayeva believes that it is due to diet.
The notion that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective is not quite plausible.
In Cengemiran, a small village not far from Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years she is still comparatively young for the area.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, which is typical of the whole Caucasus region.
The sheep is sitting on the floor with a butter churn, which she rolls backwards and forwards effortlessly.
Eight people live under this roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have been grandparents for some time.
There are also two small children running around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, served in typical, bulging Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are always in perfect order, and under her headscarf she hides long, dark blond plaits, which his son proudly reveals for us.
I have always washed my hair with milk, and it has never fallen out or lost its colour.
"I have never used shampoo," Mirzayeva said.
Monthly pension is enough to live on.
She has only eaten what she can get from her farm - tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
My whole life I have never once bought food in the supermarket.
Then she tells of her husband who was in the army.
The situation was at its worst after the Second World War.
However, everything changed when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the rod.
The propaganda seems strange from the mouth of an old lady.
The cult that developed around the father figure for the nation, who controlled his country like a dictator practically has no limits in Azerbaijan.
The latter held power until 2003 and his son Ilham later took over.
At least no deprivation is present in Azerbaijan's elderly.
Mirzayeva receives 230 Manat (around the same sum in euros) per month as her pension, which in local context is a sufficient amount to live comfortably.
The long grey son is right: "The elderly enjoy deep respect in our culture."
The children live in extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If this is not a reason to live for as long as possible, then what is?
Human rights are excluded from the constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Conflicting demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep divide in the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is fiercely disputed.
The Egyptian President is not holding back his emotion.
We must make the transition.
Making sure it succeeds is my responsibility, before the people and before God.
The speech was aimed at the entire population, but particularly at the Coptic Christians, liberals, advanced Muslims and secularists.
All of them, until now hopelessly estranged in a wildly opposition, are fearful.
Their fears are of a God State on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
According to Mohamed Mursi, speaking almost apologetically, he temporarily restricted the authority of the constitutional court and increased his own authority, in order to rescue the revolution.
However, Egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61 year old engineer, who holds a Doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save.
Should the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, the 234 articles, which have been pushed through by the Islamic-dominated 110-person Constituent Assembly, are some aspects of concern.
As was also the case in previous constitutions, the draft judicature is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
What are "principles"?
This is still subject to interpretation and there is concern that Islamists will use the woolly formulation and the resulting legal room for legal intervention in favour of a more strict interpretation of Sharia law.
The latest addition includes a new article which suggests that in all issues affecting Sharia law, the Al Ashar University must be consulted, the country's most important Islamic institution, which has great influence throughout Sunni Islam.
This can, but must not necessarily mean that the clergy will oversee legislation, which would result in de facto incapacity of the judiciary.
Many in the draft constitution are open to interpretation.
Also problematic: civil military jurisdiction will continue to be upheld.
During Mubarak's rule, these courts served to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military prisons.
The draft states also protect "the true character of the Egyptian family, and promote its moral and values."
From a legal perspective, this is formulated in such a very unclear way that state institutions could even use this article to control the content of cinematic art and literature.
In plain language, this is nothing other than censorship.
Incidentally, no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and women.
Others prohibit insult or slander of the prophet Mohamed and his emissaries.
However, what constitutes an insult and how it should be sanctioned is unclear.
Similarly, the formulation which states that "insulting people" is forbidden.
What is the best way to caricature the president, or a joke at theexpense of a jurist?
Open to interpretation, like so much in the draft submitted by Mursi to be signed and that will be sent to Egyptians for referendum "very soon."
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been gathering to fight the superior strength of the Islamists.
The Tahrir Square in Cairo, in unfamiliar unity, called for the cancellation of the charter before it has even been enforced.
The revolution is back and we are going to be victorious," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third place candidate in the presidential elections.
Noble Peace Prize winner and former Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the draft constitution is "on the rubbish tip of history."
The SMS service Twitter accused Mursi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy."
If he calls for the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him.
'We have not yet grown tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been taken for', reported the Egyptian media, citing opposition politician Chaled Ali.
The judges have signaled that they do not want to oversee the referendum, which would render it invalid.
The Koran is our constitution
The well organised Muslim Brotherhood gathered for a counter-demonstration, but acting carefully they chose the Tahrir Square, but rather a mass prayer outside the University of Cairo.
The gathering was almost full of veiled women and followers of the Salafis, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Mursi: "Cleanse the country!" and protested: "The Koran is our constitution."
The struggle for control over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything started, would have most likely cause civil war.
It was clear that Mursi's followers do not want to risk it.
The Muslim Brothers stated that both against and those in favour of the draft constitutional draft had fully expressed themselves.
The time is now to let the population decide at the ballot box, in which direction the country should go.
It is a certainty that there is a majority in favour of the Islamists' draft.
Human rights are not even mentioned once.
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutive process, which should have lasted until February and should have included all social interest groups.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and Chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when incarcerated or in court under Mubarak.
Because he shared their world view, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was broken, denounced and prisoned.
Human rights are not even mentioned in the new constitution, he pointed out in a discussion with "Welt am Sonntag."
The lawyer has resigned to Mursi extending his power to all three branches of state government.
This is a blatant breach of the ground rules of democracy and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
However, instead of strengthening civil society, the President is effectively suspending it.
With no civil society organisations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels abandoned even by the international community, which is observing the battle over the ideological direction on the Nile with a mix of curiosity and excitement.
This could come back to haunt them.
One demonstrator at Tahrir warned: "You are leaving a monster you can no longer control.
Norway's rakfisk: Is this the world's most smelliest fish?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the most high standards of living in Europe, but also worldwide.
The secret of the success of the country is linked to the local appetite for a smelly fish?
Take a selection of over-ripe cheeses.
They are placed in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet soccer kits.
Leave for a week.
Now you have the nose-numbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, spectacular scenery - and that odour, ever present, lingers in the air.
Rakfisk is a typical trawler sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for up to a year.
As the dark sets in and the weather turns cold, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this most delicious food.
They eat it raw, then swallow a glass of aquavit.
All around us people are eating little cubes of fish and knocking back amounts of drink.
They like aquavit more than rakfisk, says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is a product of very different, poor, poor times in Norway when fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn.
Then in the winter depths, well and truly fermented, it is taken out and - no doubt with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, mainly emigrating to the US.
The population is rapidly expanding - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by plentiful jobs, high wages and a comprehensive care system.
Sweden, the old rival and not long ago far richer than Norway, stream in to work.
Rakfisk is seen as a vital, but a bit smelly part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
Then everything is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich cost you £9 ($14) each.
Norway is not often on the global news agenda - and most seem to like it that way.
People here still avoid mentioning Anders Breivik, the right-wing, racist extremist who killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, the shootings are referred to as "July the 22nd incident."
Norwegians find it difficult to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder.
The growth since early 1970s of one of the world's biggest oil and gas industries is behind much of Norway's present-day wealth.
However, oil is not the only reason we are doing so well.
We are - how you say - prudent people.
The English, like most people here, is very accurate.
We are not very showy, we do not like ostentation.
Norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully, and only a small percentage of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When everyone else was throwing around money they do not have, in the years leading to the global financial crash, Norway kept its purse strings tight.
As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are happy.
"And eat rakfisk," she adds with carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue for something to eat - I have had enough rakfisk.
Now an elk burger is certainly something different and quite succulent to the taste.
In the evening, it is more of that smelly fish.
The hotel I am staying in is one of many venues hosting rakfisk dinners, where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish.
The live TV link is to a compere in a bow tie surrounded by rakfisk.
It is like Eurovision song contest.
"What score do you have for the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
Here are our points, Havard.
There is clap, laughter.
A man falls off his chair, possibly overcome with aquavit.
Maybe it is the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces a tough start
As the new Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
The most congested city in the best times, a steel ring has been erected since Monday, cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the road.
The aim was not to stop commuters from working but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the presidency sash and take over the running of the country.
The worker faces a complex task.
While Mexico has been growing economically under the outgoing administration of Felipe Calderon, the country is in the grip of drug war, which has already claimed 60,000 lives in six years.
Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will be proposing a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that aim.
Before getting his hands on the US president, Mr Pena Nieto's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, Mexico.
The population, sprawling state around the capital, opinions about the new leader are divided in his old home.
A straight man
In the scenic town of Valle del Bravo, he is remembered fondly.
Residents credit him for boosting tourism in the resort and building infrastructure.
The town is easily accessible by one of Mr Pena Nieto's new motorways, a huge improvement on the broken and bumpy road it replaced.
plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an interactive museum about climate change.
Hernandez is a friend and political ally for Mr Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
Particularly in security and the economy, we are looking for an interesting and true change that our country so needs.
After a broken 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Senator Olvera admits that after 12 years in the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there is much expectation from the party about Enrique Pena Nieto.
The new president is rejected by the opposition's characterisation of the new president as lacking substance.
The man is very straightforward, very committed to the country.
The man is an excellent statesman and, above all, he is someone who knows how to listen.
The other side of the state, that is not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be sharper.
The city is located under motorway flyovers, and in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
The problems in the municipal area are also gritty and urban.
Since last year, the military was called in to help tackle drug gangs operating in the neighbourhood, and women are particularly at risk.
On a patch of wasteland by a large landfill site, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone.
More than 1,000 women were killed in Mexico State while Mr Pena Nieto was governor, a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr Pena Nieto say, at best, he failed to address the problem of femicide while in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete home typical of the rundown neighbourhood, Irinea Buendia tries to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However her family believes she was murdered by her partner.
Then I arrived at her house it seemed to have been washed, says Senora Buendia.
There were signs she was beaten, and rigor mortis was already set in.
As her mother recounts the story, a picture of Mariana looks down from the walls, next to a cross with one word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says they have been denied.
The state authorities have treated me like I am an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up.
However, that cannot be right when there are so many irregularities and omissions.
As President Pena Nieto receives the shawl on Saturday, it comes with a heavy responsibility.
The new president has promised to make them priority during his time in office.
'I hope he is the same kind of president as he was a governor' says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
The same is what victims' families in Ciudad Neza most fear.
Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, prosecutors contend
Attorneys try to counter Bradley Manning's claims of abuse in confinement
The hearing focuses on Manning's time in the military brig at Quantico, Virginia.
Defense wants case dismissed on ground that Manning's confinement was harsh.
The Army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
Attorneys try to establish Friday that Bradley Manning, charged in the largest leak of classified material in the US history, missed multiple opportunities to complain about his mistreatment in military custody.
While cross-examining Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Maj. Ashden Fein asserted that weekly visits to Unit Officers during nine months of detention at Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about his treatment.
The cross-examination - during a hearing on a defense motion to have Manning's case dismissed on grounds that his confinement has been harsh and has amounted to enough punishment - occurred a day after he testified that he had considered suicide while in custody.
The Army Intelligence Analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of its information.
In Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that officers filled out after meeting with Manning at Quantico's brig, where he was held under a heightened confinement status from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would ask Manning questions and write down his responses.
When Fein asked about the forms Friday, Manning acknowledged that he rated his guards as "excellent" and the facility overall as "very professional."
The forms show no complaints of mistreatment, even though the officers asked Manning directly about his treatment, Fein contended.
According to Manning, the visiting officers would communicate concerns and indicate that they would be addressed, but they did not record the issues.
"They would write down no issues' after discussing the concerns, and it didn't necessarily mean I did not bring something up," Manning said.
The judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment in January 2011 meeting with a board examining the suicidal thoughts he expressed months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to get his "prevention of injury" status downgraded.
The military said they placed him on this restrictive status for his protection and for the safety of others.
"I wanted staff to know I was fine, and (I wanted to) get off the POI status to enjoy a better quality of life from my perspective."
According to the evidence, Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for about two months before being transferred to the brig at Marine Base Quantico in Virginia in July 2010.
The man reportedly thought he would suicide in Kuwait and once went out there due to heat.
The man said not being allowed to know what was going on to him or in the outside world was distressing.
'My world shrink to Camp Arafjon, to that cage', Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he spent most days in a small cell, usually 21 hours and often more.
Manning said he was allowed only a mattress, blanket, flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
The nurse tried to keep moving, because sleeping during the day or even lying down was against the rules.
Manning always slept with light from outside his cell in his eyes.
If guards could not see his face when he rolled over at night, they would wake him to roll back over.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was moved to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas in April 2011.
Also Friday, the judge asked Manning about an alleged claim that after sleeping naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count.
Manning told the FBI that he was never given a chance to cover himself with his blanket during the head count.
The judge Friday asked him to drop a blanket that could have covered him, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked because he wanted to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the waistband of his underwear or his flip flops to hurt himself but he could not.
The night after, Manning testified, his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
The lawyers hope the judge will take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply reduce his sentence should he be convicted at his court-martial, which is expected to start early next year.
The defense has said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend, with prosecutors expected to argue that the detention conditions were warranted.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules governing all maximum-custody detainees at Quantico.
Crimes against Manning include aiding the enemy, wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the Internet, transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts, he could face life prison.
My Mexico-American identity crisis
According to him, many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities there.
Mexicans tend to fault those who left; they remind Mexicans of hard times, he says.
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
Then on a recent trip to Mexico City, I had barely made the way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when I got stumped.
signs pointed to two lines: one for "Mexicans" ("Mexicans), and another for "Foreigners" ("Foreigners.")
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure of where to go.
When I was born in Central California, I was called a "Mexican" all my life.
It is ethnic shorthand in the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York as "Italian."
Later I changed to "Mexican American."
This was Mexico.
And in my grandfather’s homeland no shorthand or hyphens were needed.
I was simply an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle both ends of an interview in that language.
It is not native, and I cannot shake my American accent.
So I took my US passport and got in line for Extranjeros.
Thought about that moment this week when Mexican President-elect Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda, as usual, when the two countries meet, are immigration, drugs and trade.
Enrique Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason that Mexicans now almost always stay in Mexico as they travel to the USA.
The proposal is to partner with the United States and Canada, and create a European Union-style trading bloc in North America.
And Pena Nieto promise to continue Mexico's drug cartel war, but he provided no specifics.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with hard feelings.
Most Americans probably do not heed to the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to sign over half of their land at the point of rifle.
Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, have reminders everywhere.
The minute that an American official says anything the least bit critical of Mexico, you start hearing complaints about how Americans are invading their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
The most difficult relationship for Mexico is with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about hard feelings?
There is plenty.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason you have so many Mexican ancestry people living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in your family tree there was someone, maybe a parent or grandparent, who was shut out from opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
More often than not, that person has a profile, dark skin, little education, poor village, etc.
We are their children, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
The American Dream may now be living, having gone to good schools and taken good jobs, but we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American Dream we are living, and not the Mexican one.
Our identity may be sometimes fuzzy, but our loyalty is clear.
It is to the United States.
Additionally, we know that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
Their eyes see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us as inferior stock that is not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico never strong enough.
Our existence is, as they see, all about failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
Then we would not now be trapped behind the silk curtain, living well in the United States but lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is a rift between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans have a firmer grasp of who they are and Mexican-Americans resent that.
While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as a part of two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican Americans I know do not feel like they are part of either.
The Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both worlds, but you are rooted in either.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
In the United States we are considered Mexican.
The relationship is even more complicated, as I learned during my trip, Mexican leaders and parts of the intelligence are looking to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to place Mexican-Americans as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interest in the United States.
We would tell our Americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah.
It is not going to happen.
Many hard feelings.
With income inequality and rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a great country.
I am sorry you are on your own, friends.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are yet ready to forgive the United States for how it treats their family more recently than that, they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans still have a grudge for how their family members were treated much later.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could yet be a unlikely basis for peace.
How long can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed shows that any hope is vain.
Following the usual arguments over who started it, scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and for the first time, missiles from Gaza have landed in Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
If the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their ancient conflict, all around them the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air, and, like or not, Palestinians and Israelis are being caught in regional turmoil.
Maybe this will make their fight bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons for thinking it could just break their lethal stalemate.
A war that is not lost or won.
At first, optimism looks very difficult to justify now.
If the ceasefire is still kept, this week's fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to back off, even though Gaza has been taken by a settlement.
Although killing some of its leaders and bottling up Gaza's 1.7m people in one of the most wretched and crowded parts of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in Fatah, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained clout, Hamas has made powerful and rich friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel's close Muslim ally, has taken up Hamas' cause; so has Qatar, one of the most dynamic and wealthy Gulf States.
Jubilant Hamas people say an Islamist crescent is growing around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hizbullah party-cum-militia holds sway, through Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels may topple Bashar Assad, and on down through Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Above all, on Israel's southern flank, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, which is by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the region's balance.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ran Egypt for 30 years until his downfall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
The Brotherhood is a close cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more subject to public opinion.
In future diplomacy Hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, Israel's hardliners will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been taken back into its box.
The Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its value and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
Israelis will sleep more soundly - for a while.
In diplomatic terms, America is as steady as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for starting the latest round of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed around 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been fairly free of suicide-bombers, thanks to the barrier that cuts into the West Bank, the main chunk of a would-be Palestinian state, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with a more hawkish lot under Avigdor Lieberman in the run up to an election on January 22nd, is sitting pretty.
Why coddle those twisty Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ran the West Bank, would they not fire rockets, as their fellows have done in Gaza?
Better to keep them behind that wall and smite them if they rise.
Maybe the hardliners will win, but the Arab spring may change their calculations.
If the Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere have little love for Israel, they will prioritize their home problems.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a local superpower will not help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
The pragmatic Mr Morsi worked with Obama to obtain a ceasefire looks good - and might just mark the start of something.
Israelis too should look to the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world growing more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that is bound to explode in the areas which are occupied by Israel - much as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining democracy in Jewish state, and demographic increases as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every few years to knock back Hamas will generate growing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need assistance from outsiders.
The answer remains the one presented by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper.
The hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give little more leverage to outsiders pushing that cause.
Egypt, which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and shared Jerusalem.
Arab outsiders should also press Hamas and Fatah to join together.
It would do more to create a Palestinian state than the imminently coming bid for virtual statehood at the UN.
Obama also has a role in bringing Israel to the table.
During his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Then, in the White House, he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in.
This is absolutely short-sightedness.
America has vital interest in a stable Middle East.
It means a peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Cigarette plain packaging laws come into force in Australia
Smoking warnings and diseased body parts emblazoned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands.
Australian first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force, replacing brand logos and colours with generic drab olive green coverings, swollen body parts and depictions of children and babies sick by smoking.
While the warnings and images are different, the only difference between the packs, mandatory from Saturday, is the brand names, and they are all printed in the same small font.
It is the world's most strict regulation for the packaging of tobacco.
Australia’s federal government says the aim is to deter young people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour.
It is based on studies showing that if people have not started smoking by age 26, they will never take up.
Early in the childhood you can see children understanding the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding.
While Australia has one of the world's lowest smoking rates and the change will little impact on multinationals' profits, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry advocated hard against the law.
tobacco firms said they would boost black market trade, leading to cheaper, more accessible cigarettes.
The serious unintended consequences of the legislation will be serious, Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring more of these products down to Australia.
Others say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, silicon covers to mask unpalatable packages, had started to increase from almost nothing two months ago after British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico had sold up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was waiting for new stock.
This is good business for us.
The potential hitch, experts say, is the popularity of social media with the very target population the plan is targeting.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned web advertising by local companies and sites but cannot restrict overseas sites.
If you are a tobacco marketer and you have only one window left to promote your products, online is the most effective place for you to be in.
According to Freeman, average Joe reviews of brands on social media sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have become more common.
The question is, is that just a private citizen who really likes Marlboro cigarettes and they have gone to the trouble of making a video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry was focusing on dealing with the new rules rather than marketing.
The industry has gone as far as to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming that trade is unfairly restricted, despite no significant trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling is likely in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had already held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make photograph warnings mandatory in 2001.
The spread of the vaccinations now extends to more than 40 countries including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just grab a smoke and put it away," said Victor El Hage as he purchased a pack with a picture of a mouth tumour.
Truthfully, there is only one reason I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, who runs King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, said the uniform packaging made it harder to stack his shelves.
Once I unloaded a delivery, now it takes four hours to unload it.
The government should have banned them all and then we'd go OK, fine, we're done, we'll shut up shop.
In a Constantly Plugged In World, It's Not All Good to Be Bored.
Once upon a time I spent five unexpected hours in an airport this Thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had enough time to think about boredom.
I will not lie to you.
Half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious, even with the distractions of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shopping).
However, increasingly some academics and child development experts are coming out in support of boredom.
It is all right for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally, they say.
It forces the brain to go on interesting tangents, possibly fostering creativity.
Because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one screen or another, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom?
Yes.
And no.
It will be back to that.
First, like many people, I assumed that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon, with the advent of more leisure time.
However, Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at Calgary University in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"Boredom actually has a long history," he said.
There are Latin graffiti about boredom on the wall of Pompeii dating from the first century.
Then there is the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking over the literature and putting the idea before a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues define boredom as an experience of "wanting to, but unable to engage in satisfying activity."
What separates boredom from apathy, he said, is that the person is not engaged but wants to be.
Apathy, he said, is no urge to do something.
The core experience of boredom, he added, is "disruption of the attention process, associated with low mood and sense of time passing slowly."
Boredom can sound awfully like depression.
The two are related, but Professor Eastwood added that while they can be related, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while depressed people tend to see the problem as themselves.
sometimes we think we are bored when we just have difficulty concentrating.
Their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of Attention," published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
The group heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
The ones who heard low-level TV reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were unsure why, and attributed that difficulty to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or engaging task, disruption of attention can lead to boredom, according to Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario.
However, when you are doing something dull, such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line, distracting music can help you not be bored.
In fact, he says, squirming and doodling, often seen as signs of boredom, can actually help combat it by keeping people more alert.
Scientists have found that children who are allowed to fidget learn more and retain information than those who are forced to sit still.
We all experience boredom at some points - my flight delay, a droning speaker, a particularly tedious movie.
Some individuals are more likely to be bored than others.
Then, to help measure this, researchers developed a "Boredom Proneness Scale" in 1980s.
The scale includes questions like, "Many things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests I cannot do everything."
The researchers have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, especially when they need more, and a variety of, external stimulation.
However, generally, teenagers are pretty jaded.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted about 400 children and their parents seven to eight times a day by beeper.
The study found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not in school.
Otherwise, 3 percent of parents reported they were bored.
Professor Larson asked if the boredom percentages now, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
The researcher believed that "adolescence is a peak period for boredom, largely because children and teenagers are not given much control over what they want to do.
Again, back to my original question: Is boredom good for you?
Occasionally no, because in its extreme it can lead people to taking huge risks, gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it, research shows.
The other hand, many philosophers and writers discuss the relationship between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich.
Bodom is the brain's way to tell you you should be doing something else.
The brain does not always know the most appropriate thing to do.
If you are bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
If you watch TV, it may make you happy in the short term but not in the long term.
If your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he has not learned how to entertain himself or self-regulate, Professor Fenske said.
The self-regulation shifts from one situation to other, he added.
Your child does not just learn to entertain himself, but gets more self-control in other areas.
I don’t think we really want to celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of it.
The goal of our journey should be to feel comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
Boredom is an agonizing, restless desire to be connected with something meaningful.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to unplug and enjoy down time.
In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, he added, "it is hard to find ways to engage when the noise stops.
In Colorado No Playbook for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal charges for possessing a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Another day in September he and a few friends were driving in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when they were pulled over.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia - petty offenses that each carries a $100 fine - and given a court date.
"We get treated like criminals," Mr Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks after Colorado's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on law than on location.
Numerous misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which approved a similar measure.
Police have stopped charging 21 years and older for small-scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the law takes effect in the coming weeks.
However, more conservative areas in Colorado have vowed to press ahead with existing marijuana cases and still cite people for possession.
While several towns from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains are voting to block new, state-licensed retail marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
'This thing is evolving so quickly that I cannot know what's going to happen next', said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also scratching their head.
They are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production, manufacturing, distribution and sales - all by December 1, 2013.
The experts say that Colorado, better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now recreationally.
They have a more regulated market, so they will be good guide," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
No place or system, Mr Smith conceded, can do more than suggest what might work.
There is no real precedent for us to follow," he said.
WASHINGTON's law, called I-502, takes effect on Dec. 6, which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist, but legal possession will.
The thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time include how to balance the state's mandate of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school, park or child care center.
Cannabis businesses are not easier to find than in urban areas, particularly in Seattle metropolitan area.
On November 21, Chief Oates in Aurora sent his officers an email announcing that the city attorney would no longer prosecute small marijuana violations for any person 21 years or older, and that the police would stop charging people for them "immediately."
Chief Oates said that the police would continue to enforce city codes regulating medical marijuana growers, and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In north Colorado's Weld County, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a more strict view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to press users into treatment.
Currently, 119 people are being charged with possessing two ounces or less of marijuana, but many are facing other charges.
The Office has a duty to prosecute crimes that were crimes at the time they occurred.
The response has been complicated even in rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, are no longer citing adults for possession of small amounts.
The County's district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supported that decision, but also decided not to dismiss all pending possession cases.
'I do not think I am wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes'.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters support the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the government and the legal system was never going to be easy.
The contradicting reactions across the state revealed a deep ambivalence among local officials about the state's big green experiment.
Cultural barriers to district attorneys are a cultural barrier, according to Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
They have so much time in prison that they still don't really accept that this is legal.
As first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are ready to become national test cases for drug legalization.
As advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legal sales, they also are anxious to hear from the federal government, which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates for legalization of marijuana are hopeful the Justice Department will produce a justice report.
Although some high profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While drug agents will not beat down doors to seize a small bag of the drug, they are likely to avoid allowing the state-regulated recreational marijuana shops allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, even though it will take about a year to open.
The western city of Montrose took up a six month ban, and is likely to pass it next week.
They do not want to be placed in a position where we license somebody and then have a federal issue.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for versus what the state voted for.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford for being a Tory
It is not only today’s university students who are attacked for their views.
I cannot remember a time when I did not dream of winning a place at Oxford University.
The two of my father and elder brother have been to what I imagined was the world's greatest seat of learning, a modern day wine-blushed Greek symposium encouraging the dual pillars of civilisation, free thought and tolerance.
Then, within two weeks of taking up my place at Worcester College in late Eighties to read history, I started to pack my bags, precipitating the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
Friends were shocked.
The Evening Standard diary claimed I quit because I objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to my room.
The writer A N Wilson announced that I was going to leave because I was forced to drink out of chipped mugs.
The truth was less droll.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran, because I was subject to systematic bullying and intimidation.
No reason for my very outrageous name or the fact that I was born in a private school.
The persecution was one reason only, and in this supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric: my father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a high profile adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative supporter.
Why bring this up now?
The recent reports suggest that a new generation of Right-of-centre students are suffering similar persecution.
This is the institutionalised and increasing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal-rights protection as gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's junior common room (JCR) claim they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and made unwelcome" because of their political views.
Their goal is to create a post on the college's equal opportunities committe to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely.
Their situation was not helped by a recent BBC Two documentary, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, about student politics, which portrayed Tories as oddballs and neo-Nazis.
The event featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), travelling in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and silver-topped cane.
At other universities, Conservative students are being treated as "scapegoats" for the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice president of Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing Left-wing bias at university.
People assume we are like the Bullingdon Club without meeting us.
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed the motion for greater protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable" and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the newly elected president of OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are Right of centre.
The threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well to the welfare of members, she says.
I was in a minority of one during my first few weeks at Oxford.
I went up in September 1986, a cripplingly shy 18-year-old.
The political haat of the Conservative Party was at its most febrile stage.
The year before, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, because of cuts in higher education fund.
The atmosphere would have made a Stalinist shiver with a sense of delight.
During the first few days of freshers' week, when new students socialise with each other and the dons, I had a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
Then I found that the dons not only took part in the trapping of Tory undergraduates but also took part with relish.
The politics of miners' strike, privatisation and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid South Africa were brought into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
My first one involves translating 18th century French texts into English, and I was unprepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," he asked, "translate the first paragraph."
I found it.
Small man with a face like cake batter, Pitt was big on bile.
The question was asked, "Do Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?"
The other students laughed.
Tears pricked my eyes.
Please take some basic French lessons in your spare time - that is, if you are not too busy socialising.
I walked back to my rooms a disconnected figure.
At dinner in college I sat by myself and then I felt a light tap on my shoulder.
It was a second year English student named James who introduced himself to the OUCA.
"I know you," he asked kindly.
I am afraid it is like that.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is picked up.
It's good enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory freshers pretend to be Labour.
Later, at a local pub I aggressively tried to dissimulate.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
This ploy proved unsuccessful.
The first year PPE student who had been to Eton, told him: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students took up the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
How do Tories have sex?" one asked.
They beat each other, do they?
I felt how homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the Sixties.
Would I ever be able to lead a normal life at Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to turn to Labour and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years before me spread as a prison of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory don was Norman Stone, Professor of Modern History, who was based at my college.
The British Foreign Policy Adviser was a threat to Thatcher and one of her speech writers.
He was rarely there.
The place was provincial and petty, and for its adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took up a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You will not be happy here," he told me.
When I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, I started commuting from Oxford to my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my more openminded metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hate Oxford and why.
He was incredulous.
During his time there in the Forties, all political views were accepted.
It is the best place in the world, he added.
They would not do that, not in my dreaming spires.
Even my fellow Communist friends always had impeccable manners.
The red eyes started to cloud.
Give it a chance.
It's probably all just a tease.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent London trips, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, also a Tory supporter, took a courageous stance and renounced his faith.
During a tutorial the following week, when another history don suggested that I was an "enemy of the people" I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admit to being brainwashed by my parents and called them "old fools."
The recovery was short.
It was my father who took the nail into the skeleton of my Oxford career.
At the time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch press each week.
My door was locked.
I cowered inside, and after five minutes my targets gave up.
Then they left, I packed a suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never went back.
You may call me a snivelling wimp.
No 18-year-old should be subject to such intimidation and vitriol in an education institution.
The most tragic fact is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but still hides behind an unworthy reputation for equality and thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
The occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Couture," an exhibition that opens this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bemissen and other of the Italian designer's most famous clients.
The former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England is the only place in the UK that is worthy of hosting Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer recognized a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace" he says, in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story with only one protagonist, "signore" Garavani, but it cannot have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there are several private letters and photos from Salimah Aga Khan, Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie Chantal of Greece to Margaret of England.
Valentino displays these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from a typical couturier in Voghera, north Italy to idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
They should not drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet, like some famous pop music celebrities do.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host whose entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad" says "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing Valentino.
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couture's charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went for dinner at his flat.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
The spirit of his apartment is visible in every detail of the apartment and its decor, food and music.
All the guests were made to feel important and loved" says the top model.
The designs are art and never go out of fashion" she says.
Nobility parade
Valentino's life is not a story of obsession, but of well reciprocated love.
The man does not like well-educated people who come from good backgrounds, and they love him.
The Somerset House gallery has been transformed into a sixty-foot long catwalk, which allows visitors to walk down the catwalk while looking at a dream "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the dress Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Farah Diba.
In this crowd of mannequins, names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marite of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gilet" waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
The designer gave me a gift, says Naty Abascal, one of his muses.
”I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity, his great love of women and his ability to enhance our beauty” added the former Duchess of Feria.
I love the colours he uses, they really stand out and "lend themselves" to your face.
Their proportions are perfect.
The Princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore Valentino.
As a young teenager living in Italy, I always wanted to reach the age when I could wear one of his evening gowns...
My time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the Castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with frilly skirt, draped "corsage" and a strapless neckline.
"It was a dream come true" says Princess D'Arenberg, widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not a fashion snob, his obsession is timeless" says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg takes care of her couturier gowns with the utmost care ... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the many memories that go with it.
The "King of fashion"
The grand finale of the exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
The creation took four months' work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls them seamstresses) to create the pearl-encrusted, ivory-coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and half metres long.
The dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Valentino has been a leading example of the elite's intelligence.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank in Italy), Cavaliere della Occupazione, Commandeur of the Legion of Honour, and awarded the Legion of Honour.
"I have always been struck by his refined and calm manner, and his neat and perfect appearance" says D'Arenberg.
The last I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
The table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was immaculate, time stands still for him."
If a Princess says that...
The hardest job in the world: human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulfur along steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell, and others who - literally - work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make their living from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do so, he must descend every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the earth’s bowels solidifies on contact with air.
After breaking off large sulphur rocks, which totally can weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths.
The porters are only 250 metres from the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but they take over 40 minutes to get there, at snail's pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps to prevent falling and falling over the cliff.
They know that one slip can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who died in the hazardous Kawah Ijen cliffs last year.
The Kawah Ijen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed.
Then they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down, 1,850 metres above sea level.
This is PT Ngrimbi Candi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960, and its workers, whom it pays 662 rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells the Sulphur for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is widely used in matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
They generally carry 70 kilos, so they get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) a trip.
Every one takes three hours and you get exhausted, but it means he gets 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a small effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
'The average wage for mining is 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)' explains the porter.
Once, his wage was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and work was not as hard.
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
The 27 year old Anto has been risking his life for three years in the Kawah Ijen volcano, and the sulphur has already started to take its toll on him, even though he wears a special mask and goggles.
Asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gas from the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
"I will go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" he says in more than acceptable English.
Prisoned for life, this friendly, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur does not stop flowing at night, when its yellow colour changes to blue and it glows in the dark.
Following the shadows, Anto climbs the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to his money.
Some 400 porters carry sulphuric baskets on their shoulders from the crater.
The mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment for the porters, who work for themselves and by the kilo.
In fact, they do not even see the 30,000 rupee (2.5 euro) per camera surcharge that the rangers of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
The work is for animals, not people, says Madrusin, a slender 42-year-old porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
The lifting capacity is up to 110 kilos, which ensures that he will continue working "all he can" because he has three children, aged 18 months and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the Sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and the miners are so mild that no-one complains of serious illnesses... apart from common respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and sore shoulder joints, which have been misshapen by the weight of the smoke.
Holding the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos now he is 53 years old.
Then, he and his fellow workers collect 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away along a goat path that goes through scrubland.
'I will not retire, I will die here' says Unainik, opening his mouth full of gaps where teeth used to be.
The oldest of his five children, 30 years old, also carries sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty remains from generation to generation in one of the most difficult jobs in the world: human mule work in the Kawah Ijen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Singaporeans blame their career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and create life!
The verse may seem unlikely to be part of a mint sweet advert, but inspite this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap and use local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that the video will focus attention on the problem in a fun way.
The creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their national duty.
It is purely an Internet thing, so we wanted to make it fun and amusing.
It is the most important problem in this country.
We are the world's worst at reproducing our own progeny, so we thought it was an issue we needed to address.
We knew the Government had tried many things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
Why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem, by composing a rap?
1.2 children
Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly.
It spends $1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children.
The government package for marriage and parents grants up to USD 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
It all had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high technology city in Southeast Asia, known for its conservatism and its social control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans not have children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said that it is a result of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
The shift in life goal and priorities has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family.
This social norm has resulted in increasing number of people who are single, and delaying marriage and births, which has resulted in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised, especially Chinese who are criticised for keeping low wages and not integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest tax and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policy, in Singapore there are some unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to prevent too many small houses.
It has started to influence the real estate sector.
The city development authority has started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoeboxes," that can be built in specific areas of the city.
This apartment has a surface of 46 square metres and has been very successful in terms of sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single-living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family homes.
Lim Yew Soon, Managing Director of the real estate company EL Developers, says his shoeboxes sell much faster than large units.
The units are more popular, in the sense that they sell days, even weeks, faster than large units.
This means they are much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers, who previously had barriers to their implementation if they provided too many small units in a project.
Stress
Singapore is a city State.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district, they seem to have little impact.
They are very stressed, houses are expensive and education is expensive, so many people are turning off family.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, I am very important to have my own money and time" says another young man of around 20 years old.
Both men and women often mention careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
The Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, but when it comes to babies, Singaporeans have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Privacy.
The Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary describes private life or "the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference."
What is privacy for under 16?
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline?
The Periódico interviewed five children between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, the term was associated with "something very much my own" on a personal level, and "in the user name and password" when applied to social networks.
Jorge, aged ten, tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, with which he has had accounts for two years.
The secrets are very secret, I will tell my mother but not everybody.
FB I upload nice pictures or games.
And I have fun with people I know.
"I would not share a photo that is not mine or that belongs to somebody who is doing something stupid" he says.
The child recognises that it is against the right to post obscene pictures of naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or aggressive comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
The mother is included, and she has the password to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets.
"I do not know if they answer me, I only upload them" he adds.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends" he says.
The reply is not hesitant to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
However, he would not take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him.
Joseph, aged 14, is different.
This teenager has accounts with Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in last case he does not know 20 of the people who have been added to his friend list.
It is not a problem for me, because we have something in common, like music.
The boy says no one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number.
If they pressed me or asked for it, I'd delete them from my account.
Joseph became a follower on Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
The friend of my friend was being threatened on a social network.
The threats were threatening him and demanding money from him.
"I never found out who it was" he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He just made private."
Then he explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
Jorge is a different boy.
I would do it if I didn't like somebody, or they made me want to do it.
"However I know that it is cyberbullying" he admits.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and teenagers, they should understand that social media is for informing.
The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these websites the game changed.
Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky, with a Master's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are children and young people born with technology.
The digital immigrants are the digital immigrants who have to teach them when we are still learning.
The issue is complex, because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or divulge at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this.
They also have to be selective when what most matters is to be popular and have thousands of friends without thinking of consequences.
The most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is is through questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it is no good" he adds.
There are things you would not tell a stranger, so why do it online?
If you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When tagging party photos, did you ask other people's permission to tag them?
One more question: Do people need to know what you are doing all the time?
Other point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline.
The same rules are applied.
Outside the Internet, people act with respect, morality and other principles, so they should act the same way on social networks.
Monitoring
Stuart Guard, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is important for parents to read social networks' policy thoroughly.
By understanding all the clauses, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the consequences of opening an online account.
Examples include the age at which you are allowed to share or publish.
According to Guardia, children should be reminded of the "don’t talk to strangers" lesson.
Unasur Summit closes without publicizing the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendees.
repeatedly tried to access the document, but Presidential and Chancellor sources initially claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website.
When asked about the text, they pointed to the text as being disclosed by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in a short statement to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the summit, in the press room, only video was aired, no sound, showing the President's meeting with the message "closed session, audio restricted."
The little information circulating among reporters was given by the press representatives of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not Peruvian Government.
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents, which shocked hundreds of journalists from national and international media.
The Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the final statement of the summit, but this was not the official document that closed the summit.
The third ASPA Summit was held in Peru, and despite repeated requests from the press, the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not publicised.
The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international events, Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that all journalists were broadcasted, but restricted access to information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a Hague Court decision to resolve a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, meeted during the regional event and confirmed that they will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which on Monday, at The Hague, will hear both parties in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago.
They will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court.
'Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law and peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts', added Piñera.
The announcement of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia last week denounced the Bogotá Pact, which includes submission to the ICJ judgement on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua, which it considers as seriously flawed.
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, was not involved in the meeting.
Host President Ollal Humala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit at noon in Lima.
The President read the final document, which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid out for 31 projects between the South American countries, totaling 17 billion dollars of investment.
The resolutions included that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are extended."
According to the report, actions are being implemented to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime, actions to make medicine more accessible, low cost Internet access in all parts of South America, and to deal jointly and effectively with natural disaster risks."
With Europe in crisis, economic consolidation should not have a triumphal attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and showcase a better future for its people" Humala added.
”We have chosen a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among South America, especially in rural and border areas... building new economic networks” said Peruvian President in a message read out.
The projects are five in Peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, between the coast and Brazil, and two focus on increasing connection with Ecuador, but he gave no details.
Final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
The electoral process in that country serves to reincorporate it into the South American Union, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous, peaceful and integrated nation, with good neighborly relations, was another issue stressed by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
The day after tomorrow (Saturday) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega.
”We will review all these paths, which are not exclusive, and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua” he stressed.
Together with President Ortega, I hope to say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful way possible.
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they expect to attend the inauguration of the new President, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, the summit took place in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay make up UNASUR, but the last is currently suspended.
Peru has the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship, says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that South America must learn from Europe.
Rafael Correa, who participated in the eleventh Presidency of the South American National Union (UNASUR), told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed one another in the Second World War" and other conflicts, but now are practically one country.
This is the end goal of the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the Member States of UNASUR.
However, there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to the past.
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking account of those who have signed the San José Human Rights Pact.
The people who speak with authority never commit to anything, whereas we South Americans sign everything.
'It is inconceivable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding' he said.
Correa said he is not regretting that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his deep democratic and human rights values.
The lawyer added that he had reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be kept.
Additionally, he criticised the Swedish courts for refusing to question him for alleged sexual offence in his country, when "Swedish legislation itself requires that he be questioned via videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
Ecuadorian President Eduardo Sanchez says: "I have not spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, nothing serious" he added.
What is involved is the risk that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise.
The threat to the health of any person is very serious, he added.
Ecuadorian Embassy in London announced that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in June by the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, through the issue of a safe-conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London to resolve the prison of the WikiLeaks founder.
Human rights are not negotiated, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzon is handling several European courts, and he is handling several European courts.
The British Ambassador believed that if Britain says no to the safe-conduct pass, it's over.
If Sweden, as its legislation allows it, questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert his position as a defender of freedom of the press, adding that he does not tolerate "mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression."
The most serious enemies of press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians, but bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion.
In this regard, he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists, "or the banks or the colonial and egemonic countries that dominate Ecuador" and added that if re-elected, he will "step up the revolution to continue on the same path and direction."
Rafael Correa also supports the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UNASUR, at least until the next elections, warning that such opportunism and a coup masked with legality will in fact "destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered the "perfectly relevant" desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries, after the Hague International Court of Justice in The Hague, in favour of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For now that ruling is not followed.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflict is inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
They need to be processed in a comprehensive way to overcome them and move forward.
Additionally, he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "Latin America should refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing, however hard it may be."
With regard to his potential to be a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, he said he sees it with optimism and joy, although at times it is very hard.
Correa said if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I never have been interested in power, but in situations such as those in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
Because I believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility.
If I won, it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life.
If I lose, likewise.
It is a decision, he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new health treatment in Cuba.
Yesterday I spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned, routine treatment, and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba.
This is not a health relapse for President Chavez, he said.
In Lima today, the Ecuadorian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to ensure progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths are now increasing due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his HIV positive result.
The announcement was like a bomb dropping on me, which the doctor tried to make "softer" but failed.
The boy hid it from his family.
The disease started to become a separate disease and he started learning about it.
The most significant patient in the HIV Unit of Guadalajara Civil Hospital (CHG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health.
Fabrizio has been living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, a long time without a treatment option and stigma.
Then even the Director of an IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] clinic refused to discharge him "because he had a cut."
At that time, having Aids was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, many people still remain unaware of their illness, and only seek help when the virus has already destroyed their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
Since the first reported cases, the greatest achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal.
Infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed, with a higher life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years for patients with a 500 CD4 count.
In simple terms, HIV positive persons diagnosed at 25 years old under these terms and "as long as they keep it under control, can live no problems to 75" said the interviewee.
The average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although death has declined significantly in recent years and in Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, only 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May this year.
- Why do still deaths occur?
- I think the problem is not with access to treatment.
It is how I view it, and that's how it has been at our hospital.
The problem is that patients become in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status, which is to say, the later stages of the disease.
Another compelling statistic was given: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, so what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them.
AIDS experts and officials of the Jalisco State Council of AIDS Prevention (COESIDA) agree on this proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a private laboratory, motivated by a friend’s advice and who even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is a common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people believe they are going to die and do not want to know anything.
If I am going to die, I would rather have a blow-out three times a week.
The change was for better; I eat well, I exercise, and I take my drugs.
The family is only aware of his cancer.
I live as normal a life as any other person.
”I work, I travel, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of myself and other person” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his secrets with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate those people who today, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
They should get tested if they are at risk, because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better.
This is his message, summarizing the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Behind the counter condoms.
The gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens are huge, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up HIV cause.
And the greatest cure is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; previously they gave us one or two, now they give us hundreds of packets, and that's fine, but there are still people out there who have no access to condoms.
The most vulnerable to new infections are children.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers, counsellors and health workers who do not want to exposing young people to sex, said the speaker.
The decision to change such inefficient allocation was to place condoms on counters, but that one hundred packets should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people.
This is not promoting promiscuity.
It is not about getting beer or motel fees, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration.
However, it is not about sexuality, but it is best to provide condoms to those already having sexual activity.
Jalisco key points
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of new infections occur through sex, 6% via bloodstream and 2% perinatal.
The estimate is that 50,000 people may live with HIV, as for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who do not know they are positive.
When a United States court of appeal rejects the restructuring of Vitro Group's debt through a bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is an omission for any national company with offices in the neighboring country with solvency problems.
The conclusion is that the procedures for survival of firms that permit Mexican law are not valid in the country of stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the judgement on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the North District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenceless against possible seizures of their property outside Mexico.
The decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the United States Supreme Court, claiming three inconsistencies.
The trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational companies.
In fact, the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote, with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency, the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved.
However, Mexican law recognises the possibility.
Vitro case was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
The most common examples include Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
The fact is that, not including the votes of subsidiaries, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts, namely "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence and Liverpool Limited, did not achieve a majority.
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
The latter believes in Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis in the United States, turning its back on the country.
The Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal to allow the vote to reach the Plenary of the Court, that is, the five judges.
If this fails, an appeal for review by a higher court, in this case the US Supreme Court, will be filed.
The real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the role of amicus curiae (friend of the Court) document that details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Insolvency Law, which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, which includes the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, which includes the procedure followed by Vitro under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act, which includes the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, which includes the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, which includes the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, which includes the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, the country adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, which is the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensures fairness for debtors and creditors.
Double hammy: Vitro hit and country hit.
Balance Sheet
With the complaints against the former owner of Mexicana Airlines, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, which is accused of mismanagement, dormant for several months, the Airline Pilots Union Association has already found the bottleneck.
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
The claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Office of the Attorney General on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pesos from the IXE trust for Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources were apparently channeled towards the purchase of shares in the company Professional Hotel Management.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Opposing Dragon Mart
The group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and public voted to create a broad front against the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a large sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and Caribbean, selling Chinese products, with a residential area at the top for 150 companies.
The monumental building destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all industrial threats.
Death of ACTA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.
As you know, the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility, deeming it an infringement of the freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In order to repay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt, the housing developer Homex is placing securities exchange certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical issues offering to repay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competival
The Consortium Competival has been established, comprising the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, with the aim of selling software cluster services in Central and South America.
This area has a total investment of USD 1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetet" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, travelled the world.
few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as that of Héctor “Hetin” Reyes.
Reyes was an athlete for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 after a stroke; he was a minor league player, National Superior Basketball player, BSN representative and manager with the Bayamón Vaqueros or President of the Basketball Federation.
'I wore many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager and federative president of the National Team in the 1990s.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The wall of his house is almost full of pictures and memorabilia which goes to prove it.
Bayamon at heart
The most treasured are the ones that remind him of his time with the Cowboys from mid-50s as a player to 1982, when he completed 15 years as a co-agent or agent of the franchise.
The best years of my life were the ones I enjoyed the most because I was part of the eight championships since 1967, either as agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many good years, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I started to forget one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's first year in the BSN.
Then "Cuco" Ortiz took over - he was a great manager.
Remember that Gene Bartow, who was in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me 'I have a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall.
Do you want him?'
The beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond, who established residency here and was one of our best shooters.
I remember him talking about if Mincy gave Bayamon one championship, Gausse would help get another.
The championship with Gausse was enjoyed but from distance, because in 1988 he was already a federative bigshot.
Then he preferred to enjoy his and Mincy's accomplishments in the national team.
I remember when we first beat the United States in the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and should have been bronze, but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
The 1990 World National Team is the best you have ever seen?
It is one of the best, as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in 2004.
The most memorable moment I have is the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and gave the US team a beating, which is quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup.
The team again included Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar), and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was kept out of the 90 team by knee injury.
The team that maybe was not the best in terms of members, but which earned us a gold medal and was a great team to work with.
With role players such as 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players after the Mar del Plata Pan-American Games, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best Puerto Rican player?
Without a doubt, Piculín Ortiz.
The numbers at international level are awesome.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
Not mention his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager?
It is a difficult one.
We had a good team, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Armandito Torres.
The youngsters I really like Leo Arill’s work.
What do you consider your most important achievement in the Federation?
BSN was part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What was left for you to do?
There were things I would like to implement, such as regionalising the minor leagues.
Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Today children are riding and playing too much, unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certification and a course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
Then, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR," in the television series "Dallas," in which he played a ruthless, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon JR Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Jason Hagman, who returned this year as JR in the new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his hometown of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he most liked" the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving day.
Linda Gray, who played Hagman’s wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas, according to her publicist Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
The man was creative, generous, funny, and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
The original guy lived life to the full, according to Gray.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumour was found in his liver and he underwent transplant.
Then Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream Jeannie" aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
The role of Captain Tony Nelson is Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets a gorgeous genie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live with him.
The actor also appeared in two shows that have not been aired for long, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
The role he played in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
It was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak stardom.
The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The tagline "Who shot JR?," designed to generate hype around an episode with emotions that Hagman's character is nearly killed, has generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars being staked in gaming establishments.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
The answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, and an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in history, after the last episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was JR's sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
JR got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town.
According to Hagman, Ewing was a corrupt insatiable man with a charming smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), sectioned.
"I know what I want on JR's tombstone" Hagman said in 1988.
Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing.
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge, on and off screen person"
The man is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of fans worldwide, and in the heart of every one of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love him.
The new edition of "Dallas" was broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT.
The chain reported that he had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
After the loss of Hagman, no statement from Warner or TNT was made about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman.
Hagman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who appeared in classics such as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was still a young child when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
Then he tried his luck in New York theatre scene in the late 1950s, and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956, in England.
While there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Californian city Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolute) Tales About My Life."
Nothing in it that I believed would hurt anybody or affect them in any way" he told Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an organ donor promoter and worked as volunteer at a hospital, helping fearful patients.
"I advise them, encourage them, meet with them when they come for their surgery, and afterwards" he said in 1996.
When I try to offer some comfort, I try to offer some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but then you'll be fine."
The activist was also anti-smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Start of a course exploring the "End of the World"
Each week students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
The term, when Professor of Religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had a compelling hook: The end of the Mayan calendar, 21 December, which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming.
However, Charmé could not have known what awaited him over the next couple of months: Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal crisis some called "debt Armageddon" and growing conflict between Israel and where end-world Christians believe the Apocalypse will begin.
”I didn’t know this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever” said Charmé to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a good period.
Remember that good is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
The only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this term, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is giving the course Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Each week students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
They are looking at how they proliferate over time, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, a war could break out.
This month students analysed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explore how they compare with real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about possible, probable, credible and impossible" said Vacker.
The main Pennsylvania State University campus, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, Associate Art History and Anthropology Professor, have teamed up to give a course called "The end of the world."
Because we do not add '2012' we always have the option of running the course again if the world does not end.
The students have to study, undertake projects and take final exams.
The final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work until the very night the world is supposed to end.
The courses were quite popular.
The course for high average students was booked in two hours, with 35 students.
The term started weeks and weeks before the start of the term, from people asking if there were any places.
Students, meanwhile, say the course is one of the most interesting courses around.
”I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23 year old post-graduate Religion and Sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is just a matter of consolation or lack of it.
Wekesa, a 25 year old post-graduate Psychology and Nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class that could teach it" he said.
I enjoy.
The students interviewed - or any professor - believed in the end date of December 21st.
The first project was about the Mayan prophecy and to some extent we discredited it.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world, but it is a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
The Western culture has an apocalyptic anxiety, which goes back several centuries, when people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
In other places people do not think about it.
It is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion at La Salle University, who is giving courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question about any courses on the "end of the world" there.
The Philippines are not participating in the end of the world, he wrote, suggesting an exception from a higher authority.
We have indulgence from the Pope.
While there have been many days of the last judgement, people will immediately start thinking of the next date or philosophising that December 21st is the start of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Some said they plan to go to the end of the world parties.
Maybe I will call some friends to have a laugh together.
