Arabic is not complicated.
Can you recommend a good restaurant?
Put the gun on the table.
Give it back when you're done.
I almost forget where I am.
Sami brought a friend.
Sami looks like you.
Sami is still a fan of Leila.
That doesn't seem fair at all.
We liked the same music.
I'm leaving school at 7:00.
I went away, and I forgot my Sakado Dialy at the Darthom.
This is an abomination .
So, I'm gonna have to meet you here.
Who do you think you are?
Don't look back. I'm not going to.
School always starts at 8:30.
Where did you get the money?
I'm a man of my word.
Sami studied medicine.
My mother remarried.
Maybe Tom should stop before he hurts himself.
My mom made me a bag.

That's great!
He tried to write a short story.
He insisted on the importance of peace.
Don't move.
Hold on a second.
I walk to school.
God is greater!
Layla was just living her life.
It's a good deal.
I really want to see you today.
"I understand Italian so well", she hesitated as she picked a dish from the menu, but when the food arrived, it was as she had not expected.
Let's go to the theater early so we can find good seats.
My aunt is older than my mother.
The problem is they don't have any money.
I don't have time to finish my hypothesis.
If it wasn 't for her , I wouldn 't be alive right now .
You're wrong. That's not the point.
Sami started spending more time with Layla.
I can't do that.
We agreed to split the house cleaning tasks between us.
Sami's a college kid who loves parties.
We wear uniforms at our school.
Sami got a call from Fred's daughter.
His memory amazes me.
I have a message for you.
Did you get through to Fadil?
I'm talking about him.
Don't worry, I'll stay with you.
She's the laziest I know.
Can I go with him?
He came forward.
Layla was teaching Sunday school.
Sami gave more medicine to Layla.
She loves Tom.
The town grew into a city.
My mom worked hard to raise us .
I 've been silent for a long time .
You're home, you're home.
She killed herself.

Sami was an impressive person.
I do some light exercise every morning.
No doubt Tom is enjoying himself.
She was salty with me.
Swimming is forbidden .
Sami's office had a sofa.
It sounded crazy.
Sami sat across from Layla.
Sami returned to Egypt.
It's hard for me as a doctor to say that about another doctor, but it's the truth.
An elephant has a long nose.
Sami was upset.
Sami beat Layla and knocked her out.
All the teachers were here.
Those are her shoes.
When the wind blew, the candle went out.
Sami made a decision and no one can force him to compromise.
It's a fake.
Don't you remember him?
Tom is waiting for a response.
The sun's rays covered the hills.
Sami was facing a life sentence.
He speaks English with a German accent.
I can send you my Amazigh dictionary.
Tom doesn't sing anymore.
That's the stupidest thing I ever said.
Fadil joined a public university in Philadelphia.
We have no choice but to continue.
Can you suggest a good place to eat Korean food?
I saw you cooking.
That factory makes toys.
Raise your head.
Sit down at the table.
I'm going to save you all.
I don't want him to know the truth.
He wasn't my teacher.
Tom is running very fast.
I'm from Australia.
We know the sun is bigger than the earth.
I don 't feel very well today .
Actually, that's why I'm here.
Thanks for coming.
Go help your brother!
She didn 't come because her boyfriend didn 't come .

The hawks are New Zealand's worst enemy of birds.
The rest is on you!
Tom was home alone.
Lesson one is easy.
I hit him with a pen.
Sami was taking the dog for a walk.
They're confusing me.
Fadil lived in Sadik Street.
Which car is Tom's?
Most of the leaves fell.
The hospital opened last month.

I have your diary.
Fadl turned the door handle quietly and entered the house.
Sami shakes that tree.
They talk about this and that.
I have an Italian neighbor.
Sami went on vacation.
Hand over the drill and your ass.
I'm going to shoot him.
Where was Tom born?

She's holding something.
I go to school by bus.
It's not working.
Sami wanted Layla to love him.
The book is here.
Sami came closer.
"Tatoeba" means "for example" in Japanese.
I think he's right.
Have someone else do it, please.
The Japanese like to travel in groups.
Wait for me in my office.
I see what you mean.
We were just talking.
Let's have a look.
You're in my way.
This bus will take you to the airport.
He was wearing a blue jacket.
The police have gathered a lot of evidence from the crime scene.
Maybe he was sick.
It doesn't matter where it came from.
What do you think you're doing?
You got it?
That's on me.
Tom likes to go out.
Sami's fate is in the hands of the jury.
Nancy looked totally tired.
You can waste ten languages.
Just 15 minutes.
That's the window you broke.
Little Tom roasted a well on Mary.
We discussed the plan with him.
What major did you study at university?
Don't say anything until you think about it.
No one believed his story.
He was run over by a car.
The crescent and star are symbols of Islam.
Mary ran.
Complaining all the time.
I like the room overlooking the valley.
Where's the nearest art gallery?
Tom and Mary are playing bat-ball.
Fadil believes in the God of Islam.
Sami's life was in danger.
Sami rented a room at the hotel.
Jamie, you don't have time for your clothes.
Dima sighed and said, "I see, sorry for the confusion then. Enjoy the Vanta. And have a good day".
Let's split the expenses.
I hope to see you again.
We don't have to do this every day.
Sami's car hit a bus shelter.
I have a cat and a dog.
Layla will be brought to justice.
As in heaven, so on earth.
Ider is my favorite Amazigh singer.
Did the cat eat your tongue?
I yelled at the school.
See you later.
What does "get" mean in this sentence?
I walk every day.
"But don't you think it's a little big?" I asked the shopkeeper.
Why are you so rude?
Layla gave up on Sami.
I only have half the books he has.
Sami was in the next room.

I have a good job now.
Is anyone watching?
Thank you very much, Doctor.

I have no excuse.
She 's become rich .
I'll try not to disturb you while you study.
You have to go back.
And say the truth from your Lord. So let him who will believe, and let him who will disbelieve.
Sami disrespected Layla.
Fadil knew the police could be here any minute.
Where's the British Embassy?
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.
Does this dog bite?
A good club, Dania.
Sami was serving a life sentence.
She put the magazine on the table.
Sami called Lila, asked her to come and pick him up.
Sami never feels comfortable.
Sami offered the police to tell them everything he knew.
How far is the park from your house?
This is my home.
Thanks for the heads-up.
Let's get ready to go.
Sami looked down.

It might take a while.
I remember seeing her once on the road.
Call knows.
They're gay.
When did the meeting end?
The thick fog made it difficult to see the road.
Take your time, Yoshida.
It wasn't her!
She told me she didn't.
Sami came to the clinic to meet Layla.
I'd better ask her.
Mariko speaks English fluently.
I don't care what anyone says.
Tom didn 't want to dance with Mary .
What about you?
That's not a white candle.
Yesterday was my birthday.
She talks like she knows everything about him.

She likes oranges.
Dive in and the predatory fish will eat you.
Why is the sky blue?
I'm late because of traffic.
She accused me of lying.

I looked around.
Sami's life has changed forever.
It's too big.

Her eyes are blue.
We are celebrating Layla's pregnancy.
We won the game.

Come to the front.

Do you speak Turkish?
Tom has a scar on his face.
Fadil fell in love with an Egyptian woman.
Do you like running?
Sami came to us alive.
We have to ask Tom for permission.
Fadil became interested in Arabic.
"What do you mean?" he asked Dima, but he was afraid, because if he had remained silent, the sentence would have been too simple.
I tried to get Charles to help me, but he wouldn't.
Sami was having fun.
Take every chance.
Sami has a very double life.
We ate a whole shipment of apples.
The grass needs to be weeded.
Show me how it works.
Anyway, that's not the point.
May I ask, where are you going?
It's Tom's turtle. It's called Mary.
I hope the summer never ends.
Sami wanted you to give Layla more money.
Do you speak English?
Sami has no right to do this.
All her cats are sitting on the roof of her car.
Sami was chained to a hospital bed.
I'm glad to hear your voice.

I don 't know if Tom 's hungry or not .
Sami waited six weeks.
Sami's videos have been deleted from YouTube.
This game looks kind of dangerous.
I'm getting cold.
Good always wins.
Nancy smiled happily.
Tom answered the call.
All the bananas you brought me yesterday were rotten.
Sami and Leila were exchanging sexual partners.
I want to buy.
I went to the wrong address.
I don 't have more than 1,000 yen .
Do you drink alcohol?
The cat's agility, he jumped onto the shelf but he snapped and fell to the ground.

Is it too expensive?
"Where were you?" "I was in a meeting". "A meeting at the beach with Sami?"
I want to be a firefighter.
Sami kept texting Layla.
Are you free tomorrow?
I don't blame you for hitting him.
Nobody understands what's going on.
He 's running .
I came.
Sami was thinking about his life.
I'm going to sue you.
Excuse me, would you repeat that?
We enjoyed swimming in the river.
Tom is reading the Bible.
Music is a universal language.
What 's your favorite TV show ?
It's a 30 for you.

Maybe you know where my books are.
I have things to do at home.
You look like you did something you shouldn't have done.
But I don't want to run away, I want to see Italy.
I've been looking forward to this all week.
You can always sleep on my couch.
School starts at 8:30.
Layla cooked dinner for Vadhal.
She went to bed at ten o'clock yesterday.
Maybe you'd rather have a French dish.
What are you waiting for?
The car's coming from the right.
Stress can have a huge negative impact on your health.
Why would we want to do that?
You don't despise a man because he's poor.

What exactly are you looking at?
I like listening to music with you.
Just keep walking for a while.
Sami figured it out.
What do you like to eat?
Is that your sister?
Sami borrowed a night car.
I want to buy you a present.
Sami tried to escape justice.
Sami turned himself in to the police.
Where do I live?
Is that your car?
Call me as soon as you find Tom.
I wasn't alone.
That idea doesn't make sense.
What's the real reason you don't want to do this?
They went to dinner at a fancy restaurant.
Don't forget to think before you talk.
I want you to read it.
Sami succeeded.
You cried, you call.
Damon is complaining.
Sami was a friend of Layla's friends.
Sami is listening.
Rain turned to snow.
I'm not going unless you tell me where to find Tom.

My son went to London, where I was born.
Everybody was happy.
Where do you play tennis?
That's beyond my grasp.
Get out of bed!
Who's that boy?
Do you have a key to this door?
A cat came out from under the desk.
I understand your language.
You might have to fire her.
The hand has five fingers.
We can't wait for dinner.
I'm not swimming in this lake.
Not every question is worth answering.
Sami was confused.
Who stole the apple?
I'm sure it will.
Did you talk to me?
We're in a huge crisis right now.
Tom gave you that water gun ?
You're giving the matter too much credit.
Sami was living a strange life.
He was never happy.
Sami doesn't carry his gun.
This boat is good to sail.
I used to think it was my duty to help Tom.
Mary wanted to know if Tom had a girlfriend.
You're not the first to make that mistake.

He'll probably be here soon.
I'm worried about him.
You decided to quit smoking.
You're just hearing these voices in your head.
Layla wanted attention.
Why did you say that?
I'm a little taller than you.
