It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old dad.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That's gonna take some time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm tired of walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
You like the wheel?
He's a bread man.
I feel like a fool.
Tom isn't giving me enough help.
I'm not going to use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's give them a pass.
How much is it worth?
We were up to our necks in water.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was looking at him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you believe me, Tom?
Tom is not my father.
Tom is my neighbor.
Tom has already left.
He probably still has it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this? What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was blocked.
Breakfast is from seven to nine.
Tom came back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan has shared his racist views in public.
You know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves have devoured the herd.
That song's been haunting me for years.
I'm working.
We'll get there.
Did Tom pay the rent?
This gentleman is an acquaintance of mine.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
You ever fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
Get a free card.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have you been doing?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The watch had a warranty.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When was the robbery?
Did Tom ask why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for that job is fierce.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom knows he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make it up to him.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wants me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
The alcohol was affecting him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom was a little wrinkled in the cheeks.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have certainly answered.
I have to help him.
He's criticizing himself.
You'll find out when the time comes.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out the mascara.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think you did it.
We didn't evolve from apes, we share a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually have lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It went on all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too big a jerk for me.
I'll do that if you don't mind.
Tom is right.
You're being kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one judges you.
Stop slandering Tom.
What could possibly go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom had breakfast later.
- Are you helping?
Are you two related?
He likes ham and eggs.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take the subway than the train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom is obviously an asshole.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat. I'm not fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he give his best?
Mary turned the film.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report.
Do they buy these?
It doesn't look so good.
Hey, can you give that back?
It was personal.
I better get going, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London. I'm not going anywhere.
I won't be alone here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Are we really gonna eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you turn it around?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You are lucky.
My nose always runs when I'm cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everybody wants happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something about her.
Tom was terrible to me in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still had a price tag on it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There has to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what it said in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he was coming.
Just having a little fun.
I was gonna call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
Don't play the mold man.
She tried it herself.
Get out of here!
Is it payable for delivery?
I like the tail.
Why are we meeting here?
Glass is easy to break.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You've never seen one of these, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'm going to be fine.
Mosquitoes are the carriers of malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't know.
That's too bad.
Let me tell you something else.
What's up with you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We take checks.
A newspaper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were witnesses.
You got one.
Macedonian has four verb forms: pronounced, conditional, commanded, and supercedent.
You haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom isn't very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need a permit.
We are the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the floor.
I remember when I first met the queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How the hell did you get up?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think of myself.
I've been trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a child's play.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Tom took me to his mother's pussy.
I was only gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Does Tom think that's what happened?
The show must go on.
Make a big deal out of your good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't draw attention to yourself.
I almost fainted.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom is a trawler.
Who's on your list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Shall we wait here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you took flowers to Mary?
What's not to like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want any ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I come with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Don't get caught in the mud bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom is too sensitive.
Mary did the dishes.
We didn't expect them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
You want to play tennis?
It's going to be okay.
The sauna is here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they're gonna try to escape.
They're all crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still valid.
I'm here to look for her.
It's wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future starts today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom is playing chess with Mary right now.
You seem to be right.
Don't talk about her.
How weird.
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Tom's room is a mess.
There were no survivors.
She should have shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than live on your knees". "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I put a strap on him.
Tom isn't alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the trick.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were over a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was particularly reluctant to give speeches because of his severe speech impediment.
She didn't take the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him that Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is faulty.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in jail than to escape.
He's licking it.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing the pills.
A famous passage from his essay is worth quoting.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on that.
Didn't you hear me call?
Let's take a walk.
Don't eat too much.
Just ask them to bring it back.
Pull the plug.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
Well, you didn't want the reward, did you?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're pleased.
They're not honest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to value your health when you get sick.
Look at this star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Tie yourself up.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory is lame.
We are bankrupt.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you just help me a little bit?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
I got that from Tom.
There's not a drop of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm such a retard.
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
Electric heater heats the ceramic tiles on the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm tired of this war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from their burrows.
Let's just forget about it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he abandoned his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Did you not get it?
- Hey, ladies. - What's up?
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know, actually.
I couldn't stand it at first.
His sleeve is stuck.
I thought you wouldn't like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
- Shut up, please!
I couldn't fight it.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everybody's gone but him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die, you know.
They knocked on his door.
Tom is not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The children are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom accidentally announced to everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I've thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water got to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you're going to have to release Tom.
Shame on you!
Don't get too excited.
Sylvia really enjoyed the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom drank from the bottle of wine.
I fell off a wheel.
Come on in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
- Does that bother you?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate money.
I've got it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you cheated.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
When I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did he ask her for money?
Hold him down!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-step process.
I have a little present for him.
Here's the plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's your call, Tom.
Tom isn't shy at all.
Tom ran down the aisle.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Smell really hot.
We advertise our products on television.
I was lovely.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a couple of auditions, but I didn't get the job.
That was almost 30 years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Can Tom swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say "No"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's about to leave.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom is torturing himself.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, he didn't get what he hoped for.
I just let them go.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom really needs help.
You need to stay away from him.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom found me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says that his previous dentist told him that he would get rid of his nicotine stains if he quit smoking.

Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
This has been a night of pain.
Tom was driving through town with the brakes on without noticing.
Yeah, I mean, anyway.
You want to go camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's going to be there?
We didn't want to take Mary out of the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty bloated right now.
I'm not employed.
My old English teacher is probably turning into a grave right now.
People often complain about being treated unfairly by others, not realizing that their own behavior is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
You want to bowl?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right about that.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
You need a break?
I like to exercise.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make a sound.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humbled.
Don't call me a fool.
What does it matter?
Finally meeting you, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
He gave up on the idea.
I must sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
How different you are.
Did someone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very productive.
It was such a beautiful day, we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used obscene language.
Coffee's getting you high!
Tom was a nice guy.
It's a big football game.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was in there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We're going to miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is a good writer.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom is really pissed.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all find her behavior repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose crew is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why did you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to pitch our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
You'll have to ask him about that.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready to go.
I want you to keep your promise.
I see no one needs me here.
I can't wait.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
I want to travel. Me too.
There are many birds in these woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I'm the one Tom wanted to meet.
You should ask for their help.
I'm never going to tell you.
Tom may be richer than we thought.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I have no such desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your type.
He apologized.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking is suicide.
The hard-winged, butterflies and bats are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's make a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which one's yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom scratched his knee.
Where do pineapples come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I see the menu?
He's a smart guy.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom came on and the crowd applauded.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't succeed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda. I'm not going to drink it.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the guy.
Help me with this, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a pepperoni with beans.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so whatever.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking pot.
I know how that sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it was gonna be.
I'm hungry, you know.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped suddenly.
My dad used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a bug.
Put the bottle down.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm in a bad mood.
Tom arrived early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He always boasts of his English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any blankets?
Not a single part of the pigs failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom is packing his bags.
What's the point of that?
That's really helpful.
Tom's phone was vibrating.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go over so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Because the note was written in French, I could not read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is full.
I let her go.
Don't be silly about it.
I can't open this jar.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear you.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a high priority.
Take this.
What time is it now?
You know what I mean?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your pretty eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I will never surrender.
I hope you're up for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first swan I've seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom isn't very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
- Watch yourself!
Linda was nauseous and suspected she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know how to do.
I got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed himself.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't be shy.
I'm not safe here.
To my great dismay, Mary came to the party in a blue dress.
I'll say what you want.
I hope it's helpful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is an emotional hangover.
Let's get some sleep.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget that.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
- They work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary walked into the room.
I'm relieved to hear that.
Could you have helped us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be merciless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I still haven't solved that riddle.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom likes us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was moving his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got some serious problems.
This isn't blue. This is purple.
Who was he with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs are usually killed before they are a year old, and then eaten by humans.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you know how to be.
Can I see that?
He's spending his money on water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not sure.
Let's end this.
I've told you a million times not to overdo it.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
- What?
The book weighs.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The hotel rooms are obviously very poorly soundproofed.
- Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We're going to be fine.
Let's take a walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the lock.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels protect and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy didn't help.
My grammar is poor.
Tom was available.
Tom is going to town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is the javelin.
Who saw me.
Tom is getting closer.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did it come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That's done the trick.
These goats are bad.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second about trying to convince Mary to do that.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate this.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
May I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is sound asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about this!
He was standing in front of her.
There are multiple exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen towels.
I'm safe now.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven't found the time to write that report yet.
I can do without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
Get dressed.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I really like to walk by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off the ground.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in charge.
I'm thirty years old.
Whoa, look at this.
You know, you should hear it sometimes.
Do you know how to snore?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'm going to use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to study.
Hand in the reports.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was stained with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
We're having Italian cherries this afternoon.
Tom is from Boston, too.
Watch out, that's a tough bull.
I'm going to take Tom home.
I was gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on duty today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's a dead drunk.
I need some sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was antisocial.
I'm good with tonight.
They were traveling east.
Tom is quite strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The tiles that fell from the roof were shattered.
Who owns this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped clean the bathtub.
Come by anytime.
Tom was going to throw us out.
Tom is not ashamed.
I'm just finishing up my report.
Come on, hurry up, it's an emergency.
You better go.
Tom clogged the exit.
I have two cameras.
What are you up to?
Dan admitted to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game's not over.
Tom lowered his drink.
My wallet was stolen on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You're always having a hard time understanding what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
- Is anyone hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoeba are primitive.
You do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't have to mean that Tom is dead.
The waves are created by the wind.
Get a clean glass from the cupboard.
This is not a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for it myself.
I'd be happy to help.
There's a chance they'll kill.
I left a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French spell their word for "bubbamara".
The elevator can lift 20 tons of concrete.
You look beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
You good at that?
We're pretty good at this.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love to travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan has arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of you.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom is here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
It's actually pretty boring.
You're feeling guilty, aren't you?
I coughed up blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his beard?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a napkin, your nose is running.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you're gonna regret.
I'm upset about this.
Tom rarely goes out.
We set up a tent.
I thought it wasn't going to rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did this happen?
I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still in his pajamas and a bathing suit when I came in this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're behind the times.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
I was invited to their wedding.
Are there any more questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly see that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I tried.
A broken tree was blocking the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom has a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
Maths is his best.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
He put his head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in weird things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary that he saw John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me a jerk.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom is vain.
Some fish can change sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think you've been set up.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom is downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do this.
He's making us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and the funeral director at every funeral.
Tom is probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
You want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised to see Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Humid climates are not typical of the peninsula.
Tom knew that Mary would help him.
Tom is never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should this medicine be taken?
I don't need a bed.
- I'm not going to.
Did you get us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy don't write down their happiness.
I still don't know what we should do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm learning English.
What usually causes the pain?
We're addicted to work.
This box is made of tin.
She failed the test for a reason.
Trust your instincts.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.

Mix all the ingredients in the pot.
There was a lot of sperm.
Tom is very boring.
I got my flu shot.
Just try it.
I want to dance too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one-legged.
Is Tom interested?
Here you go.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom isn't famous.
I'm sure Tom will know how best to do it.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed before.
I'll find something.
We were eating turtle soup.
We can work outdoors, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where Tom hid the jewels.
That cake is high in calories.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm scared of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom is alive.
I'm hiding Tom.
We'll be able to seat you soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I'm told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's wrong with her?
It's not a regular pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
We'll be paid well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says that Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not a clown.
I may die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Shall we wait here?
You come out naked like that, you're gonna catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say something?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want the people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's make this simple.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should probably go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All the shops are closed.
You're making white again!
Stop beating on the dick.
Tom finished with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We're not playing games.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better be going.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom get along with his coworkers?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
Let me give you a little advice.
No matter what you do, always give your best.
Dan was encouraging Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You are a racist.
I already forgave you.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
I still can't believe it.
What's short for?
Thanks again for coming.
They're playing us.
The wounded soldier could barely walk.
The sun just came up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you give me a hug?
What's stopping Tom from doing that again?
Tom often takes movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
Light is reflected from water.
Tom swallowed the soup.
I'm not kicking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the items on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Get back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
You missing something?
A man sitting down to cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We were walking through the trees.
I'm going to do it anyway.
I knew you'd be on Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom was behaving like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You are so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going? - I'm going.
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been cultured.
Keep Tom entertained.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was pouring his bowel movements.
I'm sorry, but my answer was denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gifts.
Tom was a hard worker.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his arm around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the aisle.
- You want me to think of something?
I've got to put some water in the radiator.
I'll go with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's see.
The European likes wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's in a lot of debt.
She knows the major capitals.
What's under the covers?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom is giving everyone a drink.
You ready to go?
Tom obviously went crazy.
Tom came to them.
You think you can fool me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't mean that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her lily.
The teacher is teaching.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not good enough reason.
First, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece they talked about a lot.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk.
Did you buy the cure?
Did Tom drink?
It hurts to work.
The question is who will do it.
I'm leaving for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, all right?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's getting on my nerves.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would really like to see you.
I was wrong about nothing.
Please, just ask me anything.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom is under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
How you looking?
Tom is a child prodigy.
He walks to school.
It's getting into our heads that we can't ignore nature.
I don't understand why you won't help.
Tom seems very conceited.
Now the question is what should we do?
When was the last time you spoke to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
Don't make a sound.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl who lives across the street.
I think I can.
Tom is forgetting.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my quarters.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
She weaves a wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless they're killed.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never let you in that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is Tom looking for them?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't responded.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't call me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about that.
That can't be right.
Tom is ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has tremendous potential.
Dan's messages were outrageous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
We're overreacting.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better after he drinks a few beers.
You have lovely eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yes, it will be... when the willow bears grapes.
Tom is a counselor.
Can I talk to you for a second?
You insulted me by calling me a jackass.
Since when is there a fireworks?
Tom may be lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing as you do.
I didn't give anything away.
I was thinking about you just yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one has been able to answer, including me, despite 30 years of research into the female soul, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend to be something I wasn't.
The villagers are reaping the harvest.
Tom won't like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the gorge?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom is not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did he ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the subject?
Every time we part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is this too much for you?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's about to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that painting is.
Everybody is up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
What are you guys talking about?
Keep my luck!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not moving.
Wait a second.
I got things to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He was running as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I have no comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's plenty of air in here.
She married a nobody.
The wind's gone.
Nothing has changed.
You shouldn't wear anything that sucks.
The old man died before he could.
I don't like this book.
Luckily, I got him.
Why would Tom want that?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I got measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty common.
Did you Google that?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't count on me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, here's the explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's what I'm saying.
Are you sure we shouldn't make an appointment first?
He who can hear the butterflies laugh knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need a good one.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They were drawing lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There is no hope.
Iftar is not for you to eat like cattle!
But if I was in Brazil, I'd be a lot more scared.
You ever been a bartender before?
You forgot that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just got off work.
Where will the product be used?
I'm not a student.
I'm sick with the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food has cooled, heat it in the microwave.
The stream's to our right.
Tom isn't an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
The guy's a bandit.
It's possible that Tom saw it.
Tom is a little bit stuttering.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How do you find the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom isn't drunk, but he has been.
I enjoyed your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom stuck a fork in the plug.
Am I being replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a type of mammal.
Dan slapped Matt and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally understand.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
- Did you like his music? - No, did you?
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he doesn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our job a lot easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would I leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't want our fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm here on vacation.
He's got wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral procession.
We're probably lying to each other.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
- Fold your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles is it from here to Boston?
I'm good at that.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
It was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's running things here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's getting colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom is drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went on a pilgrimage.
Look ahead.
We've never done this before.
Here's what I think happened.
Did Tom piss you off?
This is my latest development.
I've been sick for two days.
The gut is a waste.
We don't think so.
I think Tom is rich.
I must have made it up.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a donkey and a mule.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Out in the rain is out of the question.
I'll tell them to leave right now.
Tom shouldn't have married Mary.
I got the assalone.
There was not a soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
Haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
- Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was throwing a boiled egg at Mary.
We're all safe.
Okay, I see the point.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take it from here.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
Nothing that happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't give up hope.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
Who are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure that John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was immediately worried.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
He's writing a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
The boy was unable to swim across the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
Try it.
The old lady has a certain charm.
This is a taboo subject.
We barely made it.
Did they hire you?
There's a gas leak.
Tom could see that Mary was texting.
You'll be all right.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
You can cruise in Hawaii all year long.
Tom was motivated.
You might have to help us.
Most people think computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just go up to a woman and slap her - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her I loved him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You lose.
We rolled up the rug.
Let's take a vote.
Tom is sitting.
You can't just do whatever you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was breathing a lot.
I'm a patient man, you know.
That's not what's happening here.
It's better to be an optimist and be wrong than a pessimist and be right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into several watertight sections.
Considering what you were cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's not talk about it.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your form.
He's got fake blinkers.
I'm not gonna wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I'm not waiting for them.
You don't have to be afraid.
Are you mad at me?
He's not the shy boy he used to be.
You got a count?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were groups of boys everywhere, some playing the jam, some playing the tile, some with the ball, some riding a wheel or riding a wooden horse.
Doubts can destroy friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was covered in snow.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in the bottle.
We both have to go.
The pain that love causes is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You need to go home.
Come on, this way.
I just had lunch.
Let's stay married.
We're going to find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You hit your head.
We're out of here.
Give me the seat back.
What's the purpose of it?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk about this tomorrow?
Tom is getting angry.
I can't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please, keep in touch.
Yes, I am upset.
It's less humid today than yesterday.
I'm having a hard time making new friends.
It's funny how people in the tropics eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell which one the baby wants because it's pointing both ways.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us are gonna do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't like to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a false lead.
Tom was struggling.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Somebody is singing.
Do you know how to fix clothes?
You go.
I forgot his address.
You hungry?
I'm gonna give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her stool has a splinter on one side.
We're running a little late.
I'll be out in a minute.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I'm doing all right.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Get in there.
Tom and I had an arrangement.
They're all waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very beautiful lips.
You're not a woman.
I think Tom is not breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom will get out of prison sometime.
The most precious thing is land.
Tom said he wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom is a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you object?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this one.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the darkroom.
How much is that?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they're on our side.
You're up at 6:00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had pneumonia, I just lay in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me now.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean. I'm not clean.
I had a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard me right.
Tom has a headache.
- No, not at all.
There's no one here.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
He did his best.
He's a cheapskate.
First, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs fixing.
I'm thrilled for you, Tom.
Tom is a runner.
Tom is listening to us.
They want everything you said you'd give them right away.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something about him.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are very different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is that really necessary?
Tom was behind.
I'll never cut you off.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dry.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
Maybe it's best if you call them.
Not some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I supposed to do with this?
Does your dog bark?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I like German doughnuts.
We were 18 years old then.
I make thirteen bucks an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get so upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Keep it up.
This is disgusting.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already told you, I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you.
Tom started complaining.
I think you should pick her.
Hold it right there.
You are great.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it up.
Tom looked at Mary harshly.
Tom was wearing a dux.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who started the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom is a joker.
I've been through a lot worse.
Tom learned to stay calm.
I use that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you here yet?
I only had one glass.
No one writes to me.
Tom has a broken heart.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You are a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom told his mother not to talk with her mouth full.
They all controlled themselves.
Every customer has their rights.
I only call you when I can hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they caught me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is false: I go shopping because my car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
We're surrounded.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom isn't exactly hot.
It was after midnight.
That is outrageous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom looked around, not expecting anything to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's hot in here, you can take your coat off.
I don't think I was followed.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a big pessimist.
You have the right to one phone call.
Skiing was actually more fun than I expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget about them.
Let's get you home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'm gonna tell you a secret that's gonna change your life.
Let's get this guy.
I'm doing the best I can.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get in trouble.
Their friendship quickly turned to love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'm going to stop.
I turned on the light.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine the party's like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga originated in India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom dipped his toast in butter.
We've got work to do.
I heard him snort.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on Riddon.
I'll take anything you want.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's almost Christmas.
You should be flattered.
Unfortunately, that's an inaccurate formulation of the question.
Tom was apparently used to these kinds of problems.
You're going to be fine.
It was all so easy.
I'm sorry, I spilled coffee on the fly.
He rarely went there.
Tom is stunned.
Let's sing and dance.
After a war, the winners are always right and the losers are always guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translating jokes is quite difficult, if it can even be said to be possible.
This was an arena day.
I have some bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome the weakness.
How many pills do you make a day?
I'm just going to sit here.
Do you have a key?
Let's be realistic about this.
Tea with lemon, please.
Tom has no job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came to find me, his whole body was full of alcohol.
Tom is gay.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small joint.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You're too tight when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come after you, Tom.
He won first place in the contest.
I just want you back.
Dan was smoking pot with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
She stayed late yesterday.
You are a pervert.
All of you shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
He's dropped the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How are we gonna find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can escape death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody get the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you to come back here to Boston.
Democracy is about freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You'll need a card to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that all we need?
He was desperate for health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has ear pains.
Dan was hit in the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of the night.
It's not a good time.
You're out of booze.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a couch.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do this.
Tom became famous.
I got a song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car just went over.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom got in mind?
Mother's advice would outweigh friend's.
We're not out of the woods yet.
Tom is furious.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a wig.
Dan is now wanted by the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is day one, Tuesday is day two, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom is waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I spilled it.
I like to hear Tom's stories.
Tom has seen worse.
We know everything.
It's easy to make pasta.
The hunter went deep into the woods and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay what I have to.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop yelling, my head hurts.
You're not gonna tell me what to do, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful view!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get too worked up.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'm going to get stronger.
This elephant is adored by little children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on a crimson.
She has a picture.
She swims well.
The flowers are withering.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is really annoying.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, urgently!
We're sorry about that.
Maybe Tom will get scared and give up.
Is this seat available?
Give him the attention of this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I'd like some tea.
I wouldn't want to get in trouble.
No one wants to sit with you?
It would be really nice if you kept quiet.
Tom thought Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the melody of the trumpet.
Unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom was fooling around.
I think Tom will be here on time.
Stick to the plan.
If you're hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check if the gas is off.
Would you like to participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy human company.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirted so aggressively that women ended up running away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, completely by accident.
Did Tom talk to you?
It's hard to understand self-harm if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is going to hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's night.
The pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom has been driving that car for three years.
Can Myrtle be used in dishes?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom started dreaming.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom is the leader.
You saved Tom.
You don't have a problem solved, do you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy right now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one will find me.
Tom was very angry.
What situations would you use it in?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you're gonna have to do this without help.
We are all in danger.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom is in awe.
Take Tom's gun away from him.
Look at the back.
Tom hasn't been back for three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you play any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
You study me a lot.
Tom played the piano for three hours straight.
I got a quality one.
Did you find someone to watch the baby?
I'm being quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an amazing experience.
Tom giggled in a loud voice.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I'm not saying anything.
That would be nice.
It's a quick walk.
Tom is very rusty.
That's all I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda out of there safely.
They're my cousins.
It's already eleven o'clock.
I'm gay. I'm not gay.
Tom thought about it.
We should never have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what gift Tom has prepared for me.
I saw him myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you want me to do.
Tom seems nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There is no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where there are none.
My sister does her hair in the freezer two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Rainwater evaporates when it's hot.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom is probably still at school.
I never say anything, even though it makes me nervous.
You're below his level.
I'm a little early for this.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom recruited Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you coming back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry up to catch the last train.
Please, just air the room.
Tom is still trying to get Mary to take the job.
How much of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please help me wait for Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay more than five minutes.
As time passed, the radioactivity decreased.
Are we supposed to believe that?
What are you so upset about?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary in French.
How can you help her?
Tom was set up.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for my computer.
You are a fag.
What are you up to?
Why are you being so mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping out.
No one did anything else.
Sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thanks for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not asleep anymore.
Tom made a nice statement.
They must be worried.
I moved it.
That gave me an idea.
The spring on the watch broke.
I asked around about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, follow me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his business.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do that somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to watch the baby.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
This is a problem.
Tom grabbed a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick of them.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's really good.
Let's go out on the sled.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always lifts my spirits.
I hear they pay pretty good.
Tom was a funny character.
Did you get anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me, man.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear is green.
Tom regretted what he said to Mary.
Go and find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom mumbled.
I see.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm going to scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't feel good walking around.
She seems a little young to be getting married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just about to start.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What are your hobbies?
So I'm being serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate as much as you want to.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
- Do you want me to give you a sign?
You're going to have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank-you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom has returned to Boston.
The light's gone out.
- What?
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan is walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the light on.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's really close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - it is acquired.
I like to believe that Tom was happy.
This fabric stretches a lot when washed.
Truth is an end, not a destination.
I'm hiding him.
You heard of him?
Tom started talking.
I skipped class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without a decoy, it's gonna be hard to fish.
Tom was napping.
I think she's a good dancer.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs two help.
I'll tell him to leave right now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
Everybody has drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you didn't forget something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold.
- That's not necessary.
I just wanted to clear the air.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away from the Himalayas.
Tom was stunned.
Please repeat.
You're being very dramatic.
Tom is licking himself.
Tom didn't know Mary was gone.
She was at school.
They say Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why don't you buy more of these?
We tried.
But he's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me make you something.
You've got too much to do.
Is it possible that it's Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
They voted him mayor of Boston.
Police found shoe prints at the scene.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm really hungry.
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who's gonna tell him.
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's all yours.
Can we come with you?
The more I eat, the more I get hungry.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a dick.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this on my own.
They sounded the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't diamond making?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I mention I'm finished?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm concerned about your health.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unstable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
I like it that way.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between Tom and me.
I'm not replaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich upside down.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
The boys and girls read.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.

You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come visit us next month?

The other girls taunted her about her clothes.
You'll get confused.
I'm not following you.

Don't you want to keep it?
Tom is well paid.
It was pathetic.
You obviously cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I already asked everyone.
Automated cars are now commonplace.
I can't make that decision.
I reported to the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem.
Tom carries chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to give it your best shot.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I slapped Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The organist was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you're gonna help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You are a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making the cake.
I like the blue.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed rabbit.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography in it, it'll be made.
I've been ringing the bell for hours.
He passed away a few years ago.
Can you teach me to play the harpsichord?
They picked her nicely.
What's all this?
I did what I could.
We have three kids.
I'll give you mine.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I felt like I was being owed the opportunity to spend the evening with a smart, witty, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little bit of a pain in the ass.
The girl ran away from home and broke free of parental control.
Tom is a wasteful man.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was conducted in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you were texting me the night before, but you lied to me, obviously.
Guess what.
She stripped to take a bath.
A river of sweat started pouring down my face.
Mary abandoned her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just kick it out.
I'm being taught math.
Pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How'd you move?
Movies are a great way to entertain.
I didn't see anything at first.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's only a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me like jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan on leaving.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I must have misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everybody was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to bad weather.
If the universe is the answer, what's the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world is illuminated by the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had become a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
The airport's close by.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom isn't scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The heel's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom likes to drink cold.
I gave a false address.
I'm coming around.
I'm not mad anymore.
Chances are Jane's coming.
I'm cold.
I think so.
I think you're freaking out.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom that I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
I care what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom is giggling.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really going to try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
He looked awful.
They're all liars.
How could anyone be that stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Get your shit together.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help you.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him!
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new person.
Get me a drink.
I think I might have a cold.
The question is, can he or can't he?
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls shorter than you.
I have to buckle up.
Tom almost hit Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom disobeyed his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I didn't expect you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker and weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did someone break your heart?
I feel the same way.
What's upsetting you?
We want to see Tom.
Where did Tom go?
Who won the prize?
Please be on time.
The Germans have a less than enthusiastic attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom won't be coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister is asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they laid his body in a large tomb.
Women like men with mustaches.
You forgot your wallet again.
Do you take a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, who will?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly, I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much do you think I can get for a kidney?
I said open the door.
I didn't see that coming.
Can you deliver this?
I didn't have any luck.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
A week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in there.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The islanders are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I always preferred mystery characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic. I'm not going to eat.
I voted for you.
I want pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most distinguished songwriters.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that really necessary?
Don't bother Tom.
Tom wished he'd never come back here.
Nobody likes a crybaby.
She was crying about a toy.
He tried to climb the distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would if I could.
Tom is really screwed.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got there first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
It's good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do better.
You learn fast.
We had a really good meal.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought stinking garbage bags.
I have asthma.
He is used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria while traveling in Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is it all there?
Tom's passport has expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How could you make such a mistake?
Your memory is good.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We have bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't speak French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom still isn't quite aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You already know the answer.
Can you give us a lift?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was very helpful.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'm coming to save you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I never lost hope for a moment.
Her long hair was bony brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, just give him a chance.
I never ask for a sleeve.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's the purpose of it?
I want someone else.
Don't talk to me.
They may need our help.
I got some doughnuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't look at you.
It was too late.
I live on the top floor.
The girls aren't playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was careless.
Mary broke off our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's sensitivity.
We need to call Tom.
They're going to hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear a suit.
The heater's broken.
He's gone. He was gone.
His clientele is mostly poor.
Neither of us was right.
Find the differences.
That's awful.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do that, too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname suits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
Pull out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom was reluctant to go.
Tom seems a little down this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom kicked his brains out.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't speak so loudly.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is repugnant.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more frequency.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom isn't very tidy.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a loser!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom is complex.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They were sneaking.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like some pickled fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks distraught.
Something is weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that's what's been stopping us?
Maybe we can find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's all right.
You're capable, but you're a mouthpiece.
He's been working at the embassy since three months ago.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom was furious.
It's work.
We'll get through this.
Praise encourages students to work harder.
Tom isn't very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order that.
We'll work it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself on a scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom lifted his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken.
He's fucked up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title dama was used only for nobles.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can a man choose just one?
I came to feed Tom's fish.
I'm actually here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My uncle was there, lying on the bloody bed, with a dagger driven deep into his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear your childish laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are up to something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom is quite thin.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Don't mix work and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll introduce you to her.
I'm glad you're all right.
Your patent is unsealed.
This is one of mine.
Nothing is stopping us.
Tom is sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't piss off Tom.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom is a very good writer.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking about this.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a bad headache.
As soon as he got bigger, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was riding in the back seat.
The bank loaned her a million dollars to the company.
I have so much more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Are you staying, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do everything I can to destroy it.
Play it cool.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom ringing.
I'll drive myself.
I must have had too much to drink last night, my head is killing me, I'm really hungover.
Tom was having fun.
Tom said he had no idea what the guy's name was.
I'm gonna get my hands on your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book I could borrow?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
He demands a sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and I went to the library yesterday.
I said my piece.
You are ridiculous.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose off.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is an only child.
The woman calls the man.
Tom really found something interesting.
They had a lot more than we did.
It's going to be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm really scared.
Dan was furious.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What is their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
Here are the rules.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me in front of the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom isn't very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
He blew a blood vessel in my eye.
He visited Mary there yesterday.
You're out of line!
He has a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What flavor do you like?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show's gonna be cancelled; they didn't sell a lot of tickets.
Tom is coming.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
I'm a reader. I like to read books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have lots of kids.
Tom seems stupid.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very hot.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their flaws.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What do you see here?
I feel like it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come in a car.
I'm grateful to you.
You already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one less suitcase than I did, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You are awful.
Somewhere in Eastern Europe.
Mary is a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hunchback named Cookie.
Tom is on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to water the nursery.
Do you know how that could have happened?

Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunder.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.

Can I come with Tom?

This show never ends!
The glasses are in the glass case.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to hang out with him.
If you'll excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet when you ride a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eva are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
What do you mean you're still up?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to do that again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were making love.
I burned the trash.
We both saw it.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
In the tropics, there are only two seasons.
I think I made a nice statement.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this great?
Tom said that Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are they on your mind?
Actually, I'm back with my ex-boyfriend.
Just finish this job.
I think Tom is beautiful.
Tom got a little pie.
What is Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't like it.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
- Have a seat.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
Her hair and the way she holds her head remind me of Maria.
Get out of my way.
Here we go looking for them.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would have returned.
She always works worthwhile.
What country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm going to meet Tom.
I like dogs better than cats.
There's still a little room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still can't swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
She can't stand the heat.
Looks like these two have settled down.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you right now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have a dime.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You got some nerve, don't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't mean it that way.
Did Tom do something?
I see you're awake.
Get back to work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to do a little better.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
Both are good.
What are you doing in Boston, Mom?
At first, I didn't understand a thing.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary calling out to John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to disturb him.
Tom never sits for long.
Go with the sticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
- You got it.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin condition.
She was repressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I may be ready to go soon.
Tom doesn't know how to empathize.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise was making me nervous.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm so excited we're going to Pluto soon.
"I see", said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned himself into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like this?
I'm having problems with my sinuses.
I had low expectations for him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom is out of water.
Esperanto does not belong to anyone.
She's a good hand at sawing.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
They screwed up the plan.
I don't want to lie.
Time is not money. Time is life.
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very nice.
The police are looking for me.
Tom isn't that tall.
It's been raining for a week or so.
She's recovering from her illness.
I want a spinning top.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom speak.
I know you still love Tom.
Get away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly's in the ceiling.
Her face was covered in semen.
Tom is fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
I'm not feeling anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
- Thank you. - Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating an apple.
Is that morally correct?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand anything from you.
Tom aspires to become a teacher.
Have a good week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, I can't even remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what just started.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaka got a flat tire.
We made a tree.
This is much better.
I'm gonna make her mow your lawn.
Tom is good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom was always stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a brown one.
Your sons are pretty handsome.
I know what that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We had lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They slammed the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think she's weird just because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda had been the night before.
That is so awful.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I'm not getting any benefit from that.
It still doesn't work.
Give me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
If this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The ivory jar was empty.
Don't say a word.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't back down.
They're close.
Mom and Dad aren't coming with me.
The vampire came back to life in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've finished my work.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in trouble.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom is wrong.
She hates running.
I couldn't get back to you.
- Is that true? - Yes.
I know you're angry.
When I passed this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom gets foggy.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was going to be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don't have enough money on me right now.
Are you a vegetarian? No, and you?
Lightning struck the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father was dead.
I got another raise.
I'm never going back there.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has work to do.
What are we doing today?
Do you believe in the horoscope?
I can walk.
I'm contributing to it.
It was a disaster!
Tom is good at his job.
I got it all figured out.
I'd like to know why they crossed my name off the list.
Tom arranged all this.
I'm not gonna give her up.
The flowers attract bees.
The water's lukewarm.
Before that, there was no plant life in this subsoil.
You're not capable.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's going to believe you?
Who are you seeing?
Who are we?
It was worth a shot.
I did the right thing.
Tom is too far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, what?
I'm very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not used to that.
She has tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom isn't telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
- Are they gonna arrest me?
Unfortunately, that's against all the rules.
What are you doing here, Mom?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Let's have a beer.
There's a Mr. Kimura on the line for you.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was leaking pus.
No, and it's not under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Tom couldn't help it.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be lonely.
What did you search for on the Internet?
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
Our solar system is constantly in motion.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's papers on the desk.
Tom did this.
I'm a student of art history.
I don't agree with that.
What's on the agenda?
There's more.
Looks like these two are back together.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're foreigners.
It is the translator's moral choice whether or not to translate something.
You suck.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you should ask Tom's permission.
You look so beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
Do I look normal to you?
You want to eat?
I need a box of claws.
I did it.
Take a look.
Give me the wrench.
Tom seems worried.
It was a setup.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom's courtesy.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'm gonna keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because their orbits are oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
Tom just told me.
Tom looked Mary deeply in the eye and smiled.
It was very stuffy in that room because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all right. It's all right.
The stars are shining.
- You did? - Yeah.
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom is white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I called you, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
You found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom came home.
You'll be famous in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom would be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
You shouldn't write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're a bum.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like John.
Tom is a schemer.
I just cut my finger.
I'm going to ask Tom.
I'm getting a headache.
I wouldn't recommend it.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a cure in the dust.
We were walking along the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
Depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom reacted badly.
Has Mike stopped drinking alcohol?
Tom was measuring you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
She was very happy to meet her great-granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
It smells like flowers.
Tom snapped.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started spraying.
It's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have fun as long as you can!
Who are these people?
Speak for yourself.
It resulted in great difficulties.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think they're cut out for it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
- Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help it.
I will never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer's stuck.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your bag!
And so conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom lifted the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
It's good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it is.
You're about to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom visited Boston.
The screen is giving off a green light.
English became my favorite subject.
Things happened fast.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up this morning, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee wound is rotting now.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom is a farmworker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered heavy losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, anyway?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They're gonna do that.
I'm gonna have to spend the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'll get off here.
We are paranoid.
This isn't silver.
He's got a blood vessel ruptured in his brain.
How many spare car keys do you have?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't an easy man to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a seafood.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom reread the note.
The children were drawing pictures on the sidewalk with chalk.
You're wondering what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I have to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I've been to Boston twice.
Tom got married at 26.
We already cleared that.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening to something.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom often doesn't seem to understand what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to show off the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's in the dish?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
She swims well.
You won't find us.
I've been in touch with her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me the time I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not following.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually pretty common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to make Tom angry?
Triangles don't have four angles.
There's not enough light to read.
Tom is counting on Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary opened the door.
Hey, guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I looked everywhere.
I'll speak.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom would be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your period is coming back.
Tom is wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a dubious answer.
Wake me when they split.
Mr. Gorbachev, knock down the wall!
Tom looks scared.
Tom got in.
That's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's going to be tough.
I don't feel good about retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll investigate that right away.
These shoes are hers.
Have him call me.
The rooms are empty.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should never have been sent.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks old?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.
I don't think Tom will have much to fight about.
What are you doing?
I'll get him right away.
It's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for a fact.
I've never felt so loved in my life.
I can't control her.
She drives me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I will be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't really like me.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will come.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom drives to school.
Did you see that?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'm going to get a calendar.
Everybody is talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
You write the proverbs?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing this for him.
She's a man to be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
You've only caused me pain.
What did Tom think now?
We stayed up all night trying to figure out a plan.
Tom is furious.
Tom will sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom is well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting starts.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I got a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom got there on time.
It's boring to watch TV today.
Oh, that's great.
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say goodbye.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing and you're nobody.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
That sounds perfectly valid.
It's the law!
The water pierces the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
You know, I like a challenge.
He's not sitting on the bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very much like Tom.
Tom isn't my cousin.
Watch out for the sparks flying from the fireplace.
It's just made up.
Tom was up all night yelling at Mary.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming about you.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not gonna tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam coming up.
We're headed for Boston.
Tom is a good father.
Stay here, all right?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately on the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three baskets of bug spray.
It was nasty.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my dad.
The kids love cakes.
He was pretty reserved.
I can handle Tom.
Tom got upset.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still love a horse.
I didn't even touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted he had to lie.
Mary collected all of Tom's money.
Enough of this shit.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom started to howl.
Butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom left work early.
We got it all.
I baked him these cookies.
When does the school year end?
You've been right all along.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say goodbye?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These are probably fakes.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is irresistible.
His girlfriend's weak.
Tom and I are done.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom is always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom wakes up screaming from a nightmare.
Tom has poor eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
- Is that it?
Everybody wants lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where are Tom's things?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom unblindfolded himself.
The tribe was not too happy to have a peacemaker come.
- Open up the door.
Put on your cape.
You could be wrong.
I also baked a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still at school?
It was an honor.
I've been talking to my advisors about what subjects to take.
I've already written everything that needs to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
There's no one in the classroom right now.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Does Dan know what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this one?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom is a nice guy.
I never change my sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Come on, people, get in here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a lift.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something in Tom's ear.
Tom can be very vindictive.
I saw it happen.
We're going to miss Tom very much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're being very bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or is it just me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom is probably in the kitchen.
Tom is back on his feet.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We are the mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I have to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom still plays golf, doesn't he?
I ate too much today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very nasty man!
They're camping on the beach.
I didn't like it at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one on the spot.
- What?
You want some cheese?
I'll call her for you.
He gets tired quickly.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are not smart.
That was very careless of Tom.
It's a hole.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I was angry.
Let them cut you.
Acknowledging is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll pay good money.
Tom probably went out.
We didn't fight.
Tom stared inside.
You're heavy and light and sweet and bitter at the same time; I can't live with or without you.
Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I knew.
Tom is a spineless man.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget about that.
We have to find them first.
I'm keeping score.
Tom hit Mary on the head with a plate.
Tom will kill you.
We both better get some sleep.
I always get those two names mixed up.
Tom is wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very phony.
You have to help them.
Tom didn't cry for us.
She wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom turned the knob.
I hope this is good.
If they were lying about that, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more pathetic than stupidity and indifference.
Everybody's pissed at them.
Tom didn't object.
What is the Web site's brake?
Vampires live forever, you know.
They both smiled.
What's that in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're very sensitive.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did that.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day clearing snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
You want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far from here?
I'm paid to help you.
My jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could have that ready by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with it later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train on his way to work.
You're being very direct.
Tom took the bottle out of the bottle.
Tom will be there, too.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't make me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that was hanging on the fireplace.
The roses symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
You little shit!
I will do anything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enya's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now that's over.
I'm going to fall asleep.
There's no scientific evidence that there's a link between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
He's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Avoid smoking excessively.
Tom is a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing a computer game.
You may be right.
What you got there?
This is a men's product.
We've been looking everywhere.
I really like your website.
I'll get you.
Push that button.
Tom really can fight.
What's really bothering her?
- You got the keys?
Tom broke his car.
You have to overcome the odds.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We'll take care of something.
I think Tom is tough.
You didn't answer my letter.
We calmed down.
You seem disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see where things stand.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a text from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventures.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions can't tell the difference between colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is fucked up.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look at this.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed that Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't try to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can picture you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary is doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm shorter than you.
I'll quote a passage from one of those letters.
Tom noticed that he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I'm getting pus from my right ear.
The cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We are in real danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
These guys didn't get names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging the calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone ever has.
We were packing their bags.
What kept you up all night?
They put a curse on us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary thanking her for her help.
I decided to go.
They're eating sandwiches.
The turkeys live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom is sleeping very soundly.
Are you helping him?
She looks drunk.
You can talk later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I think so. I know.
Did you drive all the way here?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over for us.
I'm sure you will.
Can you hold on a minute?
You're among friends.
You're a little weak.
I know you don't speak French.
Did he call?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer the eggs to the half-eaten.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for crazy people.
Why would I help him?
Tom lit his shoes.
We've lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I in your way?
End the violence; fight for peace.
Watch what I do.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
You hold on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna be very excited about that.
I'm a fag.
I'll see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
May I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to swim.
I should check.
Come on down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm running away.
He was driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax. I'm not going anywhere.
Tom had one daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sneaking up on the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in his mailbox.
- I'm not going anywhere.
Is there someone sitting here?
I have to cut back on my monthly expenses.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you paid yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What use am I to you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I get turned on when she wears that outfit.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
They live on the floor below this one now.
They believed.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to his wedding.
I tried to explain, but he wouldn't push the button.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a type of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom may be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom is laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to babysit his child.
I crossed out the word "Alice" to highlight it.
Third chance.
We should quit.
This is a hot paste that's popular in the Philippines.
No one said anything.
To pursue virtue and to forsake vice.
You're the smart one.
I'm against the project.
- You weren't tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie, you know that?
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is pretty harmless.
There are reports to be written.
It hurts here.
You're upsetting Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish tomorrow.
You just clicked a button.
Diseases often come at the most inopportune times.
This dog was staring at me like he wanted to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and not real people at all.
The man is hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the good memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What was Tom thinking?
It was really nice.
Everybody dies sometime.
I know how to stay calm.
We like beauty.
I think about her all day.
I suggest we concentrate on finding a way out of the cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, people!
This building is a monstrous structure.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats are bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love this!
Is that correct in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She's got ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't quite know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I'm not misunderstood.
Tom is harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom pulled out.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are wormy.
Maybe we can find something.
You look really good.
You made Tom unhappy.
Warm him up.
Tom looked like he was upset.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be stronger both physically and mentally.
She's a lively girl.
If I could stay, I would.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They started walking.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Just remember not to drop it.
I got a nine on my chemistry test.
You were lucky they survived the attack.
Tom didn't seem to be in a hurry.
Tom was handsome.
How was the dance?
I'm a student here.
I'm in the middle of it.
I don't understand why Tom wants to go to Boston.
I'm going to take Tom for a walk.
I don't feel good being alone.
I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your tire dirty.
He moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I was a fool to expect you to do anything.
You are my pride and joy.
What would you say?
Make two rows.
Headlines should catch the attention of readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than submit.
I actually work here.
Tom is suffering.
I don't have to invite anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I was watching a French movie with English subtitles.
Tom was mocking Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says the child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a turbulent relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us back.
Maybe Tom could sing for us at the wedding.
Which would Tom choose?
The hospital there isn't that big.
Most people have to work for a living.
Nothing ever changes.
Mary is pregnant.
We're going to stay.
I don't pet their dog.
I didn't sleep well.
I don't want to and I can't serve in a political party.
Girls enter puberty at the age of ten to eleven, and boys at the age of eleven to twelve.
It's off.
Tell Tom he can't forget to renew his passport.
The sky will clear up soon.
The wall is cold to the touch.
He thought someone put poison in his soup.
A lot of people do this.
I'm not allowed to tell you yet.
Mary decided to buy a blue dress.
She was a scholar.
It was cheap.
Marriage scares some people.
Was the door locked?
I have a big sail.
Why can't you come?
The inhabitants have risen up against the ruler.
Let's talk to Tom.
He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.
It's his first day at school.
Don't drag yourself home.
Tom taught me to sing.
What book are you reading? A novel.
Your car's on fire.
That gun is not a toy, boy!
Half the species are female.
They're staring at him.
It's for them.
Those are Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do community service to make up for everything I've done.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don't understand women.
Is Tom conscious?
Tom is gorgeous.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I had to take into account when translating.
He's a werewolf.
I knew you'd like that restaurant.
Are they poisonous wasps?
The kidnappers blindfolded them.
You're lying to me, Tom.
Who stole my keys?
Dan invited Linda to a student party.
Mary has been very supportive.
Tom is in danger now.
I give you my word.
Who's gonna pay the rent?
You're being a little rude.
Hey, put that back.
I wanted Tom to come.
Does Tom like Mary?
I was waiting for you outside.
I want my money back.
Tom is not interested.
Tom wanted Mary to take John to the library.
Let's find out who stabbed Tom.
Tom knows a lot.
You've seen what I can do.
We have a lot of money.
Is your appearance appropriate for your age?
Can I have a menu?
It's not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on the subject.
Tom nodded.
Do you understand the difference between right and wrong?
They're not stupid.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is poor.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I was preparing a speech.
Falcons have sharp eyes.
I wrote that to them.
I lived in Boston last year.
Tom rang the bell.
We need a new rug.
Let's share a cab.
I don't have to follow him.
Tom politely smiled.
The teapot is pretty dirty.
You need to get some sleep.
Tom took off his weight.
They went for a walk.
This is his grandfather on his mother's side.
I want specifics.
Friendships are magic.
The volcano has become active again.
Tom told me he had to take care of some things.
How's that gonna help?
Dan probably killed Linda by strangling her.
The little island looks like a turtle from a distance.
Do the trout bite?
What did Tom ask?
Stop looking at me like that.
I'm thirty years old.
His acting is by no means perfect.
It's definitely them.
Don't wait up.
You don't have who knows how much time.
The dog was barking.
Let's go to a movie.
Handsome women age much better than beautiful women.
Tom has sheep.
He hit him.
Mary felt her face warm.
I know what's bothering Tom so much.
I thought Tom retired.
Tom missed it.
Please, come with me.
I can't go anywhere.
Stop following them.
Tom is a little shy.
Tell me where Tom is.
I'm not bothered.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom is unnecessarily picking up the jacket.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking the figs.
You think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the words you make?
It hurts so bad here.
I hate carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'm gonna get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's not natural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wanted Mary and John to be nicer to each other.
Tom is replaceable.
I think I'd better help him.
You're a smart guy.
Tom said you could use my help.
You all seem so busy.
I was sure we could trust Tom.
Everybody's laughing at him.
Faith means to hope for what reason cannot hope for.
Tom was hanging out with me.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to help him.
You're wasting your whole life.
I couldn't imagine a world without music.
I live nearby.
There's a button on the inside of the door.
The two books are equivalent in value.
We rented a movie.
The darkness is returning.
Tom filled the bucket to the brim.
Pick your weapon.
They elected a new government.
I'll wash the dishes. Okay, I'll wipe them.
I would buy it.
He's the one that's crawling behind.
We value our customers.
We have to follow the rules.
It's a circus!
Tom is wet.
They asked for a raise.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was going to be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom isn't here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I would have loved to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He was gonna say something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop your weapons on the ground.
- See you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
That's entirely possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's all worked out.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's not working.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.
Tom doesn't think we want to go.
We believe in democracy.
You got that?
My day was filled with activity.
Is this yours, Tom?
My dad's got the flu.
I won't wait long.
Just look at you.
This is magnificent.
It's missing the empty space before the two dots.
Tom lives on this street.
You should see a dentist.
The soldiers were firing.
Tom can't stand that.
The store's closed.
They listened.
Tom went outside.
This is all I can do.
He sticks to his principles.
Tom is furious.
I'm just here to help him.
Their plan sounds interesting to me.
I still remember the first time I saw you.
They broke it.
Tom is a big shot.
May I put this here?
I didn't see anybody.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?
Tom doesn't believe in this at all.
I asked about them.
I'm asleep. I'm not asleep.
I'm planning on going to Boston for Christmas.
Is Tom in Boston?
It's like a snail.
You have to pay your rent up front.
Put all the garbage in the barrel.
I'd love to ride with Tom.
It's about time.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
- Will you think about it?
I don't own a guitar.
I teach Chinese.
Tom was sitting at his desk.
The ship had three decks.
Tom said he'd never see me again.
Don't talk too fast.
You go pick up Tom and come back.
I don't see any conspiracy here.
I'll give you the little money I have.
Tom wants me to throw him a birthday party next Monday night.
Take off the mask.
That's definitely one option.
You can go anywhere.
I'm going to be a fool.
I like the way you dance.
I need some of you.
We were outsmarted.
Tom is that right.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
Now point it out.
She's white.
- You sit down.
Iron is stronger than gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom became violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you for a second?
We're not gonna let you die.
The conductors are beating me.
Tom didn't say anything about that.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home in the rain.
I like being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but no friends.
Each color has a meaning.
The old house was in a bad state.
I just don't feel safe about it.
I was out of breath.
Can you reach those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I clap.
He's got me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in a city.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How am I supposed to find him?
The ice is melting.
I spit blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
That must be a relief.
I was never caught.
I love my country.
I never learned to write.
They stopped.
Tom can handle that.
Don't you lecture me.
Tom is comfortable.
Tom didn't answer my question.
The room was locked.
I can't justify it.
Tom was stealing from me.
Victory is bitter.
They look at each other in the mirror.
I'm not supposed to cry.
Tom wasn't tall enough to reach the top shelf.
Tom walked Mary to the door.
It looks delicious.
I need to understand.
You two are all up in arms against me!
I've never worn a nightgown in my life.
Don't sleep in the bathtub.
Tom tried everything.
Do you have a cigarette?
The kids are sleeping upstairs.
I'm a music major.
I didn't do that badly.
Why does Tom have to go to Boston?
I'm pretty proud of that.
Don't count on it.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers wore steel helmets.
I'm going to send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about anyway?
I guess you didn't get my message.
Tom assumed Mary had caught a fish.
It's boring to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're coming off.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
Probably not worth the wait.
I have to buy a new row for the room.
Tell Tom to write to me.
You want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What is it really about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us out with whatever you can.
Tom ran downstairs.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary were off on the first day.
Let's get out of here.
The girls are running and playing.
I'm not sure that's exactly what Tom did.
Aren't you going to eat the spinach? I'll eat it later.
This is my favorite subject.
Tom took off his weight.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are real leather and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.
Tom sang.
Tom isn't that tall.
She wears a leather belt around her waist.
They put out the fire.
They're finally gone.
Tom cried at Mary.
I'm going to go look for them.
Tom came even though it was raining.
I don't like using a dildo - I prefer real dicks.
I'm not cooking for him.
Why are you calling her?
You really need a shrink.
Tom gave a speech.
We're playing on Sunday.
Tom was surrounded.
You can only stay if you keep quiet.
I want to know what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.
Tom hit me.
I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
He's not fighting.
I expect your help.
Tom will go alone.
Tom only got straight A's in school.
Tom agreed with me.
I'm sure your intentions are pure.
Tom talked too much.
My brother's out.
It was great.
I wish I could tell people my real name.
The tooth has a temporary filling.
Tom actually smiled.
Tom is allergic to pollen.
They contacted local politicians.
Tom is taking notes.
They gave me this card.
We're going to have a discussion about the forecast.
Everyone has their own style.
That doesn't prove anything.
Can I eat this apple?
How long has it been since Tom died?
Tom is weird.
That was really nice.
My dad gives me a $10 a week allowance.
I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe. I'm glad you're not.
How long did you work for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom is scratching me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you pour wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with your elbow, right?
Men have about seven or eight times more testosterone than women.
What games do you want to play?
Tom wants to know when you can come over and help us move the piano.
Tom used to be shy.
It's getting cold.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I'm not going to lie.
I'm looking for you.
You want robots?
They're losing their minds.
He really turns me on.
I can go anywhere I want.
Tom was often bullied at school.
When does it start?
The bear is killing itself.
Tom crossed the field.
I put three teaspoons of sugar in your tea.
I like her dark eyes.
Is it time to go?
Tom calmed down.
The glove has a hole in the thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
I doubted it.
Tom isn't doing what he's supposed to be doing.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is neither your friend nor your enemy, it's just indifferent.
We did everything we could for her.
You should buy some sugar.
What's she cooking for dinner?
What did you do then?
Be careful with Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the market.
When she began to speak, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom doesn't want to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you lower the price a little?
I'm going to go first.
Tom is thirty years old now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a grandmother just days before her 99th birthday.
Did you look everywhere?
It's important to remember that no one is ever 100% anything.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit down next to me.
Tom is thrilled.
Tom never lends money to anyone.
I'm genuinely happy for Tom.
Galileo was sentenced to life in prison in 1633, but because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest.
Scientists claim that people who smile more often live longer than those who are hit by a truck.
I talk to her a lot.
Please don't ask me about them.
Tom chopped down the tree.
The land is still watered, so the sword will probably be abandoned.
I was taking a nap.
What a collection!
They all have names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog was following me.
Those were Tom's last words.
I think Tom has gone.
She aspires to be an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's work this out.
We're very sophisticated.
I threw my money in the water.
I think that's silly.
Tom is very careless.
The skyscraper is expected to sink into the swamp.
I can give her a message.
She's a little redder.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom drank too much.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom that I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood and was silent.
I collect stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
- You live here?
This room looks like a brake.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom is a fraud.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is the brother of one of the victims.
Peaches are soft.
It doesn't matter.
I like comics.
You have a really good handwriting.
The wind kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Was I talking to you?
Muscles falling from the tree.
You got a band?
You can wait here.
I got an A in French.
I want the classroom quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
Tom wants to go to the beach with us.
I voted for him last year.
The wind is blowing.
It's a risky plan.
How fast can you get from here to the post office?
I don't want Tom involved in this.
It's not a big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you should know this.
Are you wearing a costume this year?
I'll do as you say.
I'm not that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is the act of refusing to forgive.
The door is jammed.
Tom asked me for a glass of cold water.
How did you react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I'm dying for it.
He's out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember.
Tom noticed how Mary was looking at him.
You're pushing me too hard.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom is a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you get some rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk about this.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky is clear.
The noise will wake the baby.
Just look straight.
That's not exactly something a man should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play rummy.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'm going to call security.
Tom thinks he'd prefer a son.
How did you get here?
She picked up the book.
Don't take my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm going to do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will draw some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He's the one who told me about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's got it.
He's got an appetite from the long walk.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and a donut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how to do that, but Tom asked me not to.
They both smiled again.
My wedding has to be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Is it cold out?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed the danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That is just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest male in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in your journal today?
I just don't want this to ever happen again.
Can I do it alone?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peek through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I knew the deceased a long time.
We can't go into that now.
Why are you blaming me?
- What?
I'll try to make it in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
We're almost ready.
Tom has a keen ear.
I bought them.
I told you I can't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not nice to him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take your heel off.
I helped him set the table.
I had a potato schnitzel last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We sedated them.
Your religion is disgusting.
I'm sorry I ever said anything to them.
I wouldn't ask you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at 2:30.
Tom was drunk.
I slept in the pit.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He's got an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any Japanese horror movies?
Did you get them?
French was originally slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife match her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look it up in a dictionary.
Go and find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need directions.
It was ironic.
I made you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have a good time if we went to the party.
Saved by the bell.
He's got me all over the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems confused.
You're slowing down your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom seems lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat stinks.
So I should know you?
Tom skillfully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I'm guessing no matter what.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just rented Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell this dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son is a big fan of rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody is talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a bum.
We despise her.
You got there before them.
Here, brother, half of it.
Tom sent the new fly he had just bought to the table.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom is pissed.
The scenery is magnificent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of speech was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to keep it together.
Autumn has come.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You are drunk!
It was really magnificent.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
I can't answer that question.
I want to sign up for a class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat each other in a spirit of universal humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning rod.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
What's the best part?
I'm making a snowman.
You see how it works?
This soup is too salty.
Why don't you go pick it up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you a thing to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom stared into the tunnel.
How can you be my friend?
It looks familiar.
I envy you.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
There are limits to everything.
With all the noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, ginger, rosemary, thyme, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're in a hurry.
You're a shrewd man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound like enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I can keep a secret.
I don't want to run.
I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm working out.
She may have fooled you, but she won't fool me!
Let's just get some fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
It hurt.
Tom reached into his bag and took out a few coins.
The room was a buyer's room.
It's easy to solve this problem.
They need to remove the bullet that was lodged in his spine.
It's really fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know how that probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't know how much it hurts to get stung by a caterpillar.
We import grain from the United States.
This is how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan before.
They need paper, pencils, ink, and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom is not here because he is sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help with the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It doesn't seem to be a consideration to ask Tom.
My brother's arriving tomorrow morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorific?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the tail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go and ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This moron has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I like to make faces.
I was waiting for her outside.
You are impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little bit.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everybody knows about it.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad about Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They stood under a tree in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I can think of a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know that Mary had cancer.
It was my mistake.
I was hired to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't know what you mean.
Tom was stubborn.
He didn't go there.
I should break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket you got there.
I like your coffee.
Everyone was confused.
I still think about her.
I found out today that there's a movie called The Russians Are Coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary missed school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you. - Thank you.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom still can't write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying for it.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I'm not good at that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thanks for yesterday.
You got enough?
The rats are the carriers of the plague.
I'll call him back in a minute.
Tom is sketchy.
I start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The King did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm scared of Tom.
I like roasted bones.
What was Tom doing here?
He fell asleep at the wheel and caused a traffic accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was really beautiful.
Tom waves to Mary.
It's all right.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't go too far with it.
Tom is a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with something?
It's so wonderful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us approximately three hours to get down this mountain.
I'm just starving to death.
I was disqualified.
- Are you finished packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who's that with you?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You're too busy for him.
The president announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you that book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be cute.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
That sounds pretty cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
You want to stop?
Watch your step, Tom.
Tom tied his laces.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay up till 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I needed to talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom is dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom is a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom is wandering somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm went off.
I'm sorry I wasn't more supportive.
- Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'm going to stay here.
I wonder why they picked him.
That's an indisputable fact.
- Is that good?
Watch your step!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a very kind man.
Tom is a little wrinkled.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his fate.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is like Bogota, and Osaka is like Medellin.
You've stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are a type of mammal.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm cooking soup in a big pot.
If I met Jesus, I'd examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the will go?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
If a grown man lies to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You're going to be in danger.
Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom took a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan has decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the screen.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do what I can.
Tom moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I like life.
Tom isn't in his bed.
This whole thing was my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write well.
This area is in a valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
It's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston amongst me.
Please, air the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates laughed at her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd already seen Mary this morning.
I'm just making my toast with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom dumped his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one is thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was baking a cake.
Look at the countdown.
I'm impressed with your design.
You told me to call you anytime.
What's that noise?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn it off.
Tom drowned.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
- Hi, how are you? - Hi.
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the weight off.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have a theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
Tom can help you, too.
I wonder why we got married.
What good does that do us?
I'm with exactly who I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
How are you? Good, thank you.
Mary was a beautiful bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom. I'm not going to tell you.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a rhetorical exercise.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We did nothing wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't like spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were just confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom isn't good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt the need to make amends.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm going to say.
I'm not flat on you.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not seeing each other.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He slapped the dog with a rock.
Tom stared intently.
It's already 7:00.
I'm curious.
We can try.
So I wrote that book!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not get cocky.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must water it.
Tom isn't feeling well today.
We're not seeing.
Mahmoud can't stand to be banged up.
No one's listening to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for it now.
- That's not possible.
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hatred usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
I'm not wearing pants.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I said yes.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
You heard about us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom is a hopeless case.
It's a little further up.
I think about him every day.
I'll help look for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know?
I can't go into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come on in the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did this?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomaches a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come over here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You have very piercing eyes.
Isn't that what it means?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom into town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty good.
You going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Smoke and get in.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems confident.
You want some water?
Tom is not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little bit about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
He developed an addiction.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Get the shovel.
You have so many different kinds of people here.
Mary moved in with her mother.
Pick one of them.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the mass.
Tom wiped the blade of the knife from his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them came to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your nails bleeding?
Just have her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I spoke French.
He gives me a seductive look.
Don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My dad is very strict.
Maybe I should come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you get off?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom is lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda told Dan that he was a jerk.
Why would they mind?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
Here's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Is that why you bought these?
I want you to behave.
I need to get us out.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Is Tom hurt?
Who could have broken the tank?
It just came over my head.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression at various times in his life.
- Can I grab your pockets?
I'd trust it with my life.
I'm kind of hungry right now.
I'll give it a shot.
What's there to worry about?
I need some lunch.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
The class is wild.
There were penguin tracks in the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a knocker.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat all you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it out of the way.
I don't speak fast.
We need to talk in private.
Tom isn't thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a small town outside of Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did he mention the test results?
You want quality, you pay.
Tom was chewing something.
She's studying English.
With a dream like that, he'll either be a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They start beating her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We came to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom pulled the gum.
Let's have it my way.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easily bad habits are acquired!
She's been acting weird.
They probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she became interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think knows the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom ate meat at the time.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are just as strong.
The president looked strong.
What should I get?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad to see you.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do as he pleased.
I thought you played better chess than me.
Is the bridge secure?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said that Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn out the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tight town.
He was running as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stuck.
Seize the day.
What's that ringing Tom?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer beware.
Tom often skips classes.
Now it's time to make amends.
Most girls have a full hymen.
You can get out of this.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was late, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll be all right.
Does she have a dog?
I'm resting now.
Mary wore fake lashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke French better than he actually did.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria did not understand the lecture. The speaker should speak slowly.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
That medicine calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother's American.
Just relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help to find her.
The bread is moldy, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom did the job well.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked nervous.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I'm the one who decides, Tom.
Don't blindly listen to the boss.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works fine.
Tom got very sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got untied.
I like goat cheese better than beef.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't had dairy products in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was the plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everybody having fun?
I was up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters are cutting down the tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
- I'm going to kill you.
Same-sex couples shouldn't be allowed to marry.
The cow has forgotten that it was once a calf.
Give them a picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a manual job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister cut the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out that cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why should I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me, please.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk about this.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies breed more lies.
I don't have any more money.
The dining table is plastic.
Sunlight is supposedly the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I have to feed them.
She's always heartless.
They're all dead.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He lifted me up.
Did you call an ambulance yet?
After lunch, we plan to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light went on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Today, the first snow fell.
Her charm is indescribable.
I have to work tomorrow.
How much you got?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood circulates throughout the body.
I'm gonna make him go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
Lies won't help.
My right toe hurts.
The apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them presents.
What would the prince want?
Where did we come from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a scalpel?
Tom is a hotshot.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses are built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's going to bother you.
Tom didn't really think about things like that.
There's a wind.
I'm just messing with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a wristwatch.

I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom isn't much of a talker.
You were right, guys.
It's happening now.
No one else was hurt.
I decided to take the train.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
Are you eating at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat any more, I'll throw up.
Are you kidding me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't piss off Tom.
It's a grueling task.
You have to make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.

She didn't show.
I'll give you that.
I'll ask him for you.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems by keeping these tips in mind.

Tom wasn't very busy.
Tom told me he'd be back before the end of the week.
I want a room for one.
You don't need to be present for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
My headache is gone.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a little napkin.
The weather is very unpredictable here.
Is she really that beautiful?
Hey, don't hold it against me.
Isn't that unusual?
I was jumping off a wall.
The watch is broken.

Isn't that a little excessive?

It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom is still in bed.
What are you cooking?
This is your house now.
How about some sushi?
How do you manage?
I feel better.
What's the difference?

When's my turn?
Tom failed.
I'm a new student at the school.
The baby is asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It's not often someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
Are the police coming?
We have to find him first.
Dan made the assistants laugh with his comments.
You don't have to go.

I would be for it.
History is written by the victors.

It's for the heat.
Nothing is sacred.
Tom seems to be quite proud of himself.
No one really knows.
Give me the shovel.
She came.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're cleaning her up.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted like that.
I was three blocks away.
I came to talk about her.
We're having fish for dinner tonight.
I don't eat out very often.

Dan may have had a fight with Linda.
The room was quiet.
Everybody likes him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot in hell here.
I saw that coming.
This is your doing!
Please come back to me.
He's studying here.
I'm here to congratulate you on your wedding.
Kids, stay right here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Does your dog bark?
- That's great.
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
We're going to get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.

I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you just the way you are.
It's funny, you know?
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was in jeopardy.
I wish I hadn't.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why won't anyone help us?
The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
You enjoying this?
I had a great night.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the tram.
It's nice of him to bring you presents like this.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or you'll get thrown out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get this show on the road!
How long is the trip?
I'm good, thank you.
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.

I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a log.

That's it.
I can give you a lift.
Is Tom safe?
Still, there is a solution.
You're disorganized.
I'm trying to.
I'm sure Tom will get by just fine.
I don't think I've ever been this scared before.
Can you do the job?
We have to go back for him.

I swear.
We have three guards working shifts.
We can't stay together.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you describe it in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a little embarrassing.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I like crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took this picture.
Tom shut his mouth.
So you hate him, don't you?
Stop being such a child.
Tom is not down.
He never hired them.
I like cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom is a retired dentist.
That was very sweet.

Tom told me he was planning to go to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a whole other story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm out of here.
I'm going to change.
Put the phone down.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom that I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom kept working.
Please find my head.
Why did you choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom disagrees.
They turned down our first offer.
Sooner or later, my film will break.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, ever, ever could that happen here.
Tom was warming up in front of the fire.
I don't want to talk about this.

Tom waited for us.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom is an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.

The toy is made of wood.
Thank you in advance.
The question is what are you gonna do?
Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom looked a little surprised.
We haven't found him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
It was two days ago.
It's not a shame.
You bite me, I'll bite you back.
You really should have let me call a cab.
I made apple pie.
The heat from the horse's hoof calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the subject completely.
I think this is over.
Linda wore modest dresses all the time.
- Are you smoking?

I'm late for school.
Tom contacted Mary.
You cook for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure you will.
We're going to have to ask Tom for permission.
His joke made everyone laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen all you need to.
This is pointless.
They're out.
How many cups of coffee a day is too much?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue this conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
You're going?
I'm happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop fooling around.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I flushed one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are as good as those.
She seemed excited.
We're wasting our time.
Tom said that he and Mary couldn't come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom hung his coat in the closet.
I think Tom is a petty person.
Can you tell the difference?
Come and see us tomorrow.
Tom visited Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn't actually do that.
Is this your bag?
Sleeping will help her most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'll move the dishes.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
Dolkun's been working really hard lately, but he's not seeing the slightest result.
Dan found out that Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to my place next Saturday if you want.
I'm not convinced.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Will you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We saw aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom is sound asleep.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom will go to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She dreamed of becoming a nurse.
Tom has OCD.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate.
You have a rash.
It's written all over his face.
Thanks for coming by.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom wouldn't have made it without Mary's help.
So that's where Tom is?
Dan spent last night drinking at a meat locker.
I'm in the house.
You need a ride?
Sal is gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
That's a classic.
Tom is already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really nice.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
I wouldn't trust Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I don't think we were followed.
I feel free.
Just keep smiling.
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that's no argument at all!
Tom got a pie.
What am I gonna tell the kids now?
Let Tom go.
I'm over the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom being this tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew that Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How was your vacation?
We were just a few of us in a group of gorillas.

I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?

Do you travel a lot?
Did you tell Tom about the back pain you're having?
Everybody does that.
Tom is often unpredictable.
They loved each other.

I want you to find her.
The water glows in the sun.
A is a set that consists of the elements C, B, and A.
Tom is free.
Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You are a fraud.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
I'd be happier if you three got back out there.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom practices the violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's really fun.
Let's do that tonight.
I felt their pain and suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I'm dying for it.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a great shock.
Your car's on fire.
She managed to learn to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom's.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room is noisy.
At your service.
I like watching football on TV.
I'd still like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my place.
Tom and Mary seem perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more stuff I have, the more I'll have to clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to apply some sunscreen.
Was it hard for you?
Tom's voice was barely audible.
Don't be such a dick.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reorder.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom is guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom is good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love looking for words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will wait.
I'm starving to death to bend over.
The real story is a little different from what you said.
It was your mistake.
The balloon was coming down slowly.
Who likes bugs?
It's a piece of shit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted as if he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew immediately that something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm completely naked.
Her gestures mean nothing to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are eating pizza.
It's not a big surprise.
We need something to take our minds off our problems.
I called yesterday.
Let me focus.
She sells marine schools.
Ward the prisoner.
We all like you.
The baby cried and cried for hours.
I'll go and ask them.
Tom doesn't look anything like his brother.
Tom was different.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
There's no way Tom could have done that alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know what time it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might be needed.
I have chest pains.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.
You have to show yourself first.
My father is a quiet man.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional drummer.
He stole my new watch.
It doesn't look much different.
He's out of control.
Tom made room for Mary on the bench.
We're going to dump him.
It's all right.
Let's go to the zoo.
I don't know whether to be happy or not.
Did you get it?
Tom writes to me and tells me about his trip.
Your pronunciation is more or less correct.
I don't know anybody like that.
Keep looking for Tom.
We're still warming up.
Tom and Mary left the room, leaving John alone.
It's so complicated.
I thought you were funny.
The thief stole the gems last night.
Green light... red light!
Tom is your teacher.
I already packed.
Since when do you feel the fetal movements?
I can't do this alone.
You better let me do that.
This house is better than that one.
Tom must have done that.
Let me see it.
What's in it?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost finished.
Marry me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom caught a fog.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
He who pays the bills has the right to be master.
You are very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I hear you.
Give me those sheets.
You can have mine.
Tom won't like that.
All comments are superfluous.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them to help?
Tom broke his mouth.
That smells like cheese.
Tom is not deluded.
The patient is suffering from hallucinations.
Why is it so important to be there today?
Valor without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom looks offended.
We know him.
I've been napping there for hours.
Tom was holding a drink.
What a couple!
Did Tom get up early this morning?
Your complaints have upset me.
I'm naked, you know.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy in here.
What can be done?
I assume you found it.
Don't take that too literally.
Tom is quite talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom is crazy.
I'm going and that's it.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what happens.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom is cooperating.
The snow is a foot deep.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom has been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby is licking the weasel.
I'm going to go find Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This should do it for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not that you weren't right.
Tom obeyed right away.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
There is no life without burdens.
You've got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom do that.
Don't call me a dick.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open to page nine.
Tom unbuttoned his jacket.
Tom was beaten up.
Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We were arguing.
Does Tom eat grapes?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't swear or I'll rinse your mouth out with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a present.
I'm not entirely satisfied with Tom's explanation.
You seem to be right.
He ran away to avoid capture.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom hasn't come back yet.
It has sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?

It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The weekend home was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, grill, soccer field and pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We are all pawns.
I'll see you around.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been asking about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was bothering his sister.
We should have given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been in vain.
Why are you doing this? I can do anything.
You're such a pig.
Lock the door.
Tom turns on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be there for you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You can come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my mistake.
This sounds perfectly acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trusting and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to kneel.
What were you and Tom doing yesterday?
I'm not gonna hold back.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two genders in Irish.

Who are you living with?
So what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom is in bed and talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was excited.
I'm eating some pasta.
Can you translate it?
We are lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need more time to move them.
The noise has the whole town in a frenzy.
A man who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This is not a joke.

That's not good.
There may be discussions about that.
The women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This is not your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom may be wrong.
They might need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom is acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I figured out what time we're supposed to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternity.
First, you have no right to jump to conclusions, and second, your argument was based on a false premise.
Who could blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I raise cattle.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you around.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
Tom has a mustache.

We'll let Tom try.
That would make sense.
I'm going to wash my hands.
Pick one of them.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and disgusting.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom is no longer in sight.
I think we're ready.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I drove by it, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all he has?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's only fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
We won this time.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave him a sedative.
This is not relevant.
I'll be back in a little while.
She looked as if she were deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing can happen to us.
I'm right here.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting a divorce from you.
That dinner.
My bottle is leaking.
You're going to get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser spews a jet of hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
Belkim, you're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I have no home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone to help me.
They don't want that.
Tom takes over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said that if he won the lottery, he would buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Gemstones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother's permission first.
I'm going to take Tom's place.
What made you come to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You're getting a little chicken-y.
It was a beautiful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I was in a hurry to eat.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else remembered.
You can tell the difference easily.
I'm going to go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, French was the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I counted to 200.
Keep this.
Should I go?
Boy, he looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We have fried goose and potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Make your point specific.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm going to lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed at Mary.
We're not drinking enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's awful.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do what I want.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'm going to be fine.
I ran into something weird.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a lovely ring.
Go see if Tom is in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom was yelling at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He blackmailed her out of a large sum of money.
Can you help me solve this?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter one last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'll go find another one.
I'm starving to death.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make a spider web.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.

Long live the Soviet Union!
Eptane is strong.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's a simple question of where.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was affected.
I feel guilty.
How did you know Tom was going to lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk on tequila.
My grandmother is deaf, in other words, a little deaf.

We need more money.
It doesn't get lost.
Do you agree with your parents?
Tom is doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you believe us?
I pay my respects.
Be merciful.

I think we should hire him.
Where did you get that?
Tom is a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else am I getting?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We tried to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept going up.
Tom might be able to light your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
He lied to my face.
I'm going to find her.
I wanted to get married.
They listen.
I wasn't aware that Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll walk away.
They'd only bother Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Do not touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found a secluded beach and spent the day there.
Nothing has changed.
They were all on the clock.
It's a little blunt, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's your business.
That's a very contradictory explanation.
Walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
Wasn't that awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.

We're not safe here.

When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was delicious!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm getting high.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.

Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what's in the papers today?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six cups of coffee a day.
Tom squealed loudly.
It was better.
Tom started running.
I'm gonna ask you to stay a little longer.
We're keeping two goats.
I see Tom every day.
They all pointed at her.
Tom may be dead by dawn.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be there in time.
Tom was insane.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why are you asking me?
Why did you pretend to be the first to hear about Tom?
Tom let go of his hand.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam has stained my glasses.
So it wasn't a no.
I didn't mean it like that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the lead flag?
Get ready to move!
I told you it was gonna be hard to pull off.
I think I found one of those.
You're going to try, aren't you?
Tom went without food for a week.
I don't understand you.
Though I am a godly man, I am still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I should know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so mad at me.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the award.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing the same thing Mary is doing.
We need to investigate something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your breast?
Tom drank quietly.
I'm shot!
Who said anything?
Tom started to say something, but Mary silenced him.
We met at the fair.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I didn't have anything to drink.
I've been all over town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
The nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
The medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom is not a member.
I guess our job is to keep that from happening.

- Will you help?
Don't pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I got back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Let's do it once.
Better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at 11:00.
You can ask me anything you want.
He used to really like Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a better salary.
He found someone to talk to.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human because it's from another dimension.
They're boring me.
What's the weather like?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they've invented a cure for it yet.
Every member must be present.
He didn't get the joke.
This is the ugliest snowflake I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
It doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me give Tom a message.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Flour is made from wheat.
Don't you touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on that subject.
You're right.
I'm going to go.
Today is my 16th birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's get back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You are beautiful.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
I could be wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog. He was in the car.
He scraped his collarbone playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show is over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is going blind.
You really think this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was cocky.
This is not an easy decision.
The prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please inform them.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I was cooking.
Watch the road.
We'll stop along the way.
I heard Tom cry.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves on that.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
So you could play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave it to me.
The rock was scratching down the hill.
She went to the freezer.
Tom is absolutely crazy.
Let's do it again!
It's not his heart.
It's not for comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom isn't that young.
At the time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin is very cute.
You are such a freak.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was okay here.
They look like they're stuck.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I would never leave the house with a toenail.
I think Tom is a pussy.
She got a terrible infection and her ovaries are leaking.
I don't need advice.
This is not costing us.
It's out of the question.
Tom headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's a little weird sometimes.
We were going to hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a second.
I have a list of her.
That was really stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're a powerful man.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cake of cabbage?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the subject.
She really wants to talk.
I have tons of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
- This way. - Okay.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom would want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, alive?
This was on top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we made our confession.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's a little hot for a demekvr?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm all wet.
Are you into him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm on the phone.
I've lost track of time.
This island is U.S. territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in this room?
I've thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You've cut your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little introverted.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy this stuff.
Not here, not there.
The phone books are fascinating.
There's no need to be defensive.
This is the best pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things never change.
