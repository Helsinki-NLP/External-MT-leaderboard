The city of Juankoska will join the city of Kuopio in the beginning of 2017.
The city council approved the association unanimously on Monday.
The city council approved the association last week.
The municipality of Tuusniemi was also involved in the dissolution of the municipality, but its authority decided that Tuusniemi would continue to be independent.
Coupi and Juankoski decide on the implementation of the following municipalities separately.
Local elections will be held next time in 2016.
After joining the Juankoska, the population of Kuopio is approximately 111,000.
Japan and India meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet with his Japanese colleague Shinzo Aben in Tokyo to discuss economic and security relations, on his first major foreign visit after the May election victory.
Mod's five-day visit to Japan is intended to strengthen economic relations with the world's third-largest economy.
The top of the discussions is the plans for extended nuclear cooperation.
India has also said it is interested in the defence cooperation agreement with Japan.
Putin: Ukrainian troops shoot civilians
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday accused the Kiev leadership of refusing to conduct direct political talks with eastern Ukrainian separatists.
The current Kiev leadership does not want to conduct a significant political discussion with the eastern part of its country, Putin said news agency Itar-Tass.
He also said that Russian-minded separatists, whose Kiev and the West say they are supported by the Russian army, tried to push Ukrainian troops further from their current places where Putin said Ukrainian army troops are shooting civilians.
The goal of the militants is to remove these armed forces and their districts so that they do not have the opportunity to shoot the inhabitants of the region, Putin said.
The event was held on Friday and Saturday at Ryrmikorjaam.
It was surprising that the crowd arrived early in the morning.
The visitors were expected in two days, promoter Tom Kangas says.
The Hiphop Festival was held for the third time.
Again next year.
We are going to continue to be hip-hop festivals, that is, poppie is not allowed, Kangas assures.
In Finland, a law enters into force on Tuesday that restricts the procurement of materials suitable for the manufacture of explosives.
In the future, individuals must seek authorisation from the Police Administration to purchase or keep in their possession substances or mixtures that could be used as the so-called source of explosives.
Such substances include hydrogen peroxide, nitrometane, nitric acid, potassium chlorate, potassium perchlorate, sodium chlorate and sodium perchlorate, as well as the mixture containing them, if the prescribed concentration values are exceeded.
Water peroxide is found, for example, in cleaning and washing materials, but the concentrations in them usually do not exceed the limit values.
Nitrometane is used for example in the acceleration period.
However, the originals acquired before the entry into force of the law may be held in possession and used until 2 March 2016.
George Webster accused of hotel crashes in Nairn and Pitlochry
The suspect for two rape cases in a hotel is being prosecuted.
George Webster, 28, heard the accusations at Glasgow’s Supreme Court during the session.
He is accused of the rape that occurred at Pitlochry Scotland’s Hotel in Perthshire on June 7, 2013.
Webster is accused of attacking a woman “in an unconscious state, while sleeping, and thus being unable to make a decision by itself.”
Webster is also accused of another rape at the Golf View hotel in Nairobi on May 4, 2014.
In accordance with Judge Lady Rae's decision, the trial will be held at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on 17 November.
Super Raheem brilliant - Mario stayed in the shadow - Super Raheem brilliant - Super Raheem brilliant - Super Raheem brilliant - Super Raheem brilliant
Only 19-year-old Raheem Sterling once again showed why he is considered a hope for the future of English football.
White Hart Lanella had an electric atmosphere on Sunday when Mario Balotelli's strengthening Liverpool arrived to Tottenham as a guest.
Super Mario's first appearance was promising: experienced English journalists saw a 24-year-old Italian working on the field in a completely different attitude than Manchester City's time.
Balotelli was still far from his top.
The Italian man lost three high-quality matches and only eaten half of his sixteen matches for his own team.
Players who have already taken the player in favour are expecting better in the future.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers placed Balotell in the role of Luis Suarez who travelled to Barcelona as the team's second attacker alongside Daniel Sturridge.
As a star of the team, instead of Balotell, the middle-field diamond top was raised by Raheem Sterling, who scored 3-0 victory over the important opening goal of Hugo Lloris.
Sterling, 19, is not just brilliant.
The English is 20 centimeters shorter than the Balotelli is between the lines of the opponent than the fish in the water.
The feature is not common for a player who is grateful for the grid at the best at about 34 km/h speed.
Rodgers also deserves a great gratitude for Sterling’s development.
After the match, the Northern Irish team told us how Liverpool has systematically developed a more comprehensive player from the northern island that has grown along Wembley.
Susanna Mälkki was elected supernatural master of the Helsinki City Orchestra - "I'm happy and proud"
The city government of Helsinki has decided to appoint Susanna Mälki to be the next supernatural master of the Helsinki City Orchestra from autumn 2016.
The Los Angeles Times also asked what orchestra he would take next.
Susanna Mälkki says she begins her new job with joy and pride.
The Helsinki City Orchestra has played a key role in the music life of our country for more than a hundred years, including the presentation of a large number of Sibelius music.
The orchestra is led by the best Finnish chapel masters and I have worked with many members of the orchestra earlier.
I look forward to our future cooperation with enthusiasm,” he says.
The Government of the Employer Organizations gathers in the Pension negotiation case - Home - Regions - News - Karjalainen
The pension negotiations are now calling for a new pace from the social organizations’ own meetings.
The governments of SAK, Akava and STTK will discuss the negotiation issue in the morning.
The real pension negotiations will continue.
Employment organisations have blamed for, among other things, the dispute about the bonding of the pension age to the life expectancy.
Organizations have promised a job solution by autumn, but according to the latest estimates it would occur during this week.
by Pihtipudas.
Rovaniemi's women's airball league team Woman Volley compassed the league to the Vampire Athletes in the final of the Pihtiputa training tournament on Sunday.
Vampula scored five of the last matches for 3-2 victory.
In the last part, WoVo lost 15-11.
The neighbor was a step ahead.
The battle was good, but in the defense and pass game Vampula was a bit better, WoVo's coach Teemu Mäkikyrö saw.
WoV's sixth was so scary that 190-cent American secretary Jennifer Keddy had his back stuck on the side.
The game was played by Sara Niemi.
Karolina Kyllönen, despite her fingership, was playable and formed with Johanna Pekkarisen the most powerful combination of WoV.
Jenna Keskimäki was able to make room for Jana Jaudzem for the last 1.5 part time.
The best part of the vampire was the skilled Russians and the libero Hillaelina Hämäläinen, whom WoVo had driven as much as possible.
WoVo’s preparation for the league will continue next weekend as Hämeenlinnan HPK arrives in the training camp for Rovaniem.
The team will meet on Saturday at 18 a.m. in the official training game.
On Sunday, we will meet at the school for a repetition.

Ovary cancer dies more often in rare areas due to delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in honor of her mother who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural areas in Australia are more likely to die from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers looked through the patient data of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35 percent of women, or more than five years after the diagnosis.
Susan Jordan from QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute confirms that women living in rare and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
New drugs may slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers went through the seven-year history of women’s health.
According to Dr. Susan Jordan, the age of the woman at the time of the diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, previous diseases and socio-economic status also affected survival.
In older women and when cancer was widely diagnosed, the likelihood of survival was the lowest.
Women living in rare and remote areas were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women living in urban areas.
The study did not aim to find out why women living outside the cities are less likely to cope with ovarian cancer, but Jordan considers the possible causes of delayed diagnosis and difficult access to treatment.
“Gynecological oncology specialists are best treating this disease, and their receptions are mainly located in large cities,” Jordan says.
Though remote therapies are being generalized and the importance of distance is decreasing, the researchers also propose to increase the mobility of doctors so that specialists can treat patients closer to these homes, as well as programs to support remote-home patients.
According to Dr. Jordan’s study, the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is poor regardless of their geographical location, which emphasizes the need for better treatment and better cancer prevention programs.
The research funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer charitable organization will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, a 33-year-old family mother living in Gold Coast, Elisha Neava, was diagnosed with malignant ovarian cancer.
The city of Rovaniemi wants to strengthen the station-stable car park operations in the Friendship Park, which is located next to the hotel in Pohjanhov.
The city government decided on Monday that the proposal for the station plan of the Friendship Park and its neighborhood will be placed on the publicly visible service point in Osviita.
The draft proposal is requested by the Environmental Council and the Life Centre of Lap.
Through the design change, the city wants to enable tourism-related motorcycle activities to continue in the area.
The place is intended to form a park area that contains the area between the present Friendship Park and the river.
During the period between November 15 and April 30 there will be a maximum of 200 motorcycles.
In the area may also be placed tank points on a specified part.
Transportation is also allowed in the new park area.
The city of Rovaniemi has rented the Friendship Park area for safari companies for motorcycle cycling during the winter.
The rental agreement was last renewed in the spring of 2014 and the agreement is in force until the spring of 2018.
The change in the design and design has caused strong opposition.
The residents of the neighboring countryside have been intimidated with both the voice and concerns about emissions.
However, the emissions in the area have been examined and no observations exceeding the indicative values have been shown in the reports.
The new equipment is less emissions than the old.
The Friendship Park as a parking area is also supported by the fact that if the departure place was moved further, the safari customers of the hotel should be transported to the departure places of the safari by buses, which would be estimated to be 15 departure per day.
The area of the Friendship Park and the nearby environment, according to the city, is also sufficiently wide for the villages, better than the places presented as replacing outputs, such as, for example, the eastern side of the Ounas River bridges of the sea tour.
The Friendship Park is good for its location so that the activities can be expanded in the future, for example, to the area of Ounaspaviljong.
Establishment of parking is part of the city strategy approved by the Municipality of Rovaniemi, according to which the city’s objective is, among other things, to create a good framework for business activities by reserving sufficiently high-quality areas for logistically and functionally affordable places.
The Friendship Park has also been marked as the starting point of motorcycle cycling in the center’s part-playing scheme, which has not yet received legal force.
The decline in property houses is seen in garden shops
The decrease in the number of housing owners, especially in the group of people under the age of 35, may lead to a decrease in the turnover of garden stores by tens of millions as today’s young consumers reach the “main target group” of garden sales for their age.
According to the Financial Times report, housing renters spend only 55 percent of the money they spend on gardening.
The study also showed that more and more people live in highly urbanized apartments with no gardens. In addition, the size of the garden decreases as the front edge is increasingly covered as a parking place. Also these factors threaten the garden sector, the estimated value of which is about 5 billion pounds per year.
In London’s large area, housing ownership has decreased from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in six years, and there the least money per household is spent on garden products throughout the country.
According to the HTA and the British Garden Association (RHS), increasing housing rental or decreasing garden size does not mean that people can’t grow plants.
Guy Barter, RHS’s chief gardening officer, says that “for example, plants that are grown in transferable crops are popular among housing renters, because such crops can be taken with change if necessary.”
According to the HTA report, the years 1997-2005 were a prosperous period in the garden sector, as the ownership and wealth of houses increased from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
The report also predicts that the trade will rise this year thanks to better weather conditions, worse than the weather in March and April last year.
Turkey interrogates U.S. diplomat for spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has called on the country’s most experienced U.S. diplomat to issue a report on the U.S. and British spy in Turkey.
Vice-President Bulent said the U.S. ambassador and Turkish authorities discussed the report on Monday.
The German newspaper Der Spiegel and the internet reader The Intercept have written that the documents leaked by former analyst Edward Snowden by the National Security Agency (NSA) reveal that Turkey was the main spyware of the U.S. and the UK intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan undermined the importance of the report by saying that all major states have spy each other.
The previous report on the spy targeted by the German main intelligence service in Ankara caused a more angry reaction in the Turkish government.
Cannes winner Croze appears in a new Finnish film
In several successful films, Canadian actress Marie-Josée Croze has been attached to the female role in a new Finnish film.
Croze will play director Mikko Kuparisen in the movie 2 nights in the morning, whose footage will start this week in Lithuania.
Croze won the Cannes Film Festival’s Best Actress Award for her role in the 2003 film The Invasion of the Barbarians.
He has appeared, among other things, in Steven Spielberg’s film Munich and Julian Schnabel’s film Perhonen’s glass picture.
Two nights in the morning is a movie by Mikko Nousiainen.
The film will be released in Finland in September 2015.
Major police officer in Mallorca accused of corruption
The case revealers presented evidence of the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia's executions at the Mallorca Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The Calvian police chief, located in the resort island of Mallorca, has been arrested for a wet celebration as a result of corrupt accusations made by the business and bar owners of the well-known Magaluf region.
Supreme Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested after several Punta Ballena Street owners filed corrupt charges against him. Punta Ballena Street has most of the Magaluf bars and nightclubs.
According to the online daily magazine Mallorca Diarion, the reporters presented evidence of the police and officials of the municipality of Calvia's anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
The Spanish National Guard has arrested two other local police officers in connection with the corruption charges, and they are being interrogated by the judge together with Navarro.
The country-wide daily ABC wrote the nightclub owners angry about the authority’s partiality, which significantly compromised their business.
“It’s no longer a matter of money, it’s a matter of survival,” one shareholder told the court.
You will not destroy our business.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf was in several countries in the titles of the newspapers this summer when a YouTube video was broadcast on the internet in which a 18-year-old British holidaymaker had sex with 24 men during the so-called pub crawl.
Since then, the island’s authorities have been trying to prevent the humiliated and uncontrolled use of the Magaluf vacationers by reducing the number of participants in malignant, alcoholic pub crawls.
Additionally, the Playhouse nightclub, where the sketch video was recorded, was sentenced to be closed for a year, and the nightclub owner and the pub crawl organizer, Carnag, was sentenced to be sentenced to a total fine of €55,000.
Particularly among young British tourists in the recommended Magaluf tourist destination has also become popular the so-called balcony trend, which has caused several accidents caused by alcohol use when people have jumped from the balcony to the other or from the balcony to the hotel's swimming pool.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after a summer bombing after rocket and cranate bombers bombed their communities during a 50-day Israeli-Hamas war and schools remained closed in the region's recovery from struggles.
The opening of schools caused joy and excitement in the southern Israeli communities bombed by missiles, but the traces of the battles are still visible.
In the southern city of Ashdod, in the Pashosh dayhouse, workers removed the traces of scraps from the walls and slides before children arrived in the dayhouse by a rocket shot.
“We’re a little scared but also excited,” says Ronit Bart, who lives in the Saad kibbuts, a Israeli community, and works as an English teacher at the city school.
Many children living in this area need painful routines.
Bart’s 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that returning to school in a long time would be “very strange.”
“We’ve had difficult times when we didn’t leave home anywhere,” he says.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbuts near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Before the start of a ceasefire last week, thousands of inhabitants of the Saad-like border communities had stayed inside or left their homes to safer areas beyond Gaza to flee the fire of missiles and cranates.
Many inhabitants of the Nahal Oz community near the Gaza Strip are suspicious of the return of a Palestinian cranate killed in the community of a 4-year-old boy.
According to the Ministry of Education, a total of 10 families had not yet returned.
The children of these families are currently placed in alternative schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, near the Gaza border, which was the subject of a heavy Palestinian attack.
She encouraged the children to study hard and promised that “the education and safety of the children will be cared for.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on a ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire immediately stopped the struggles, but it did not bring a solution to many key issues, such as Hamas’ demands to remove the island of Israel and Egypt, and to reopen the air and sea routes in Gaza.
Israel wants to withdraw from Hamas’ weapons and to restore the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who have fallen in the war.
Egypt is expected to start a new round of indirect negotiations later this month.
According to the Palestinian and United Nations estimates, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of which were civilians and at least 494 children.
According to the report, at least half of the dead were soldiers, although it had no good evidence of this.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza soldiers shot 4,591 missiles and cranates into Israeli cities mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 missions and other attacks.
Israel's attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of houses in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people fled for protection to more than 100 schools held by the United Nations, which had been converted into temporary protection.
While tens of thousands of people were still protected and the struggles continued, the school authorities moved the school to the beginning last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon and we will get back to the school, just like the other children in the world and just like the Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old man who lives in a school in Gaza.
According to the commonly used meter, the prices of apartments have risen the highest for seven years in the Australian winter months.
The price index for RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, which measured the prices of housing in the Australian capital, rose by 1.1 percent in August, the RP’s data were revealed on Monday.
With the rise during the summer, July and August, prices increased by a total of 4.2 percent, which is more than in the same months since 2007.
The annual rise of prices was 10.9 percent, more than twice as much as in the 12 months preceding August 2013, but prices have not risen uniformly across the country.
According to Tim Lawless, RP Data’s research director, Sydney and Melbourne are at the top of the price rise.
The results of RP Data show that the prices of apartments rose in Sydney by 16.1 per cent and in Melbourne by 11.7 per cent in the previous year.
The housing markets in Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin are the next most vibrant; the average price rise is from five to six percent.
The weakest housing market is in Canberra, where prices rose only 1.4 percent per year as a result of government expenses.
According to Lawless, the spring in Australia begins to increase the number of apartments in sale over the coming months, which is a real test for the housing market.
“Given the rise in the sales of auctioned apartments, the generally vibrant sales rate and the continuous low interest rates, it is likely that the rise in the prices of apartments will continue in the next three months,” says Lawless.
The new Museum of Gösta has drawn record audience to Mänta
The new museum and image art have attracted a record audience this summer.
More than 70,000 visitors have visited the Serlachius Art Museum by the end of August.
The new Gösta Museum was opened in June and has been presented, among other things, pop art classics by Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein.
On Monday, the photo week said they made a record of visitors when the Momentan event had visited 14,500 people this summer.
These numbers are not used to.
People have been throwing out of the doors and windows,” said Pauli Sivonen, director of the Serlachius Museum.
Sivonen estimates that the total number of visitors to the Serlachius museums this year will approximately a hundred thousand.
Over the past few years there have been about 40,000 visitors.
Mänttä-Vilppula, located in the middle of Tampere and Jyväskylä, has about 11,000 inhabitants.
The museum director Sivonen reminds that new museums are always when phenomena are opened.
“The challenge is to make the phenomenon permanent,” he says.
We hope that the art season will continue over the summer.
In the autumn, new exhibitions will be opened.
Police are investigating four theft in the last few days.
On Sunday afternoon, a window was broken into a business property.
He had received a small amount of money from the cash.
Between Thursday and Monday, a car tank fuel was stolen.
The ship was taken from the port between Sunday and Monday with the trailers.
It was a fish mark from the outside and cellered from the inside.
In the interior, the text "OIVA" was read at the bottom of the point.
A couple of suspects have been arrested by the police.
On Sunday afternoon, the property was destroyed.
The police dog got traces and a twenty-year-old man was found hiding under a hole in the forest.
On Monday, the police attacked another man from Paltamo, who is suspected to have committed the same crash.
Amphetamine Disappeared in Cairo
The disappearance of just ten grams of amphetamine led to the murder of a Caian man born in 1977.
According to the prosecutor, the man had gone to the apartment with his partner and another man and shot the suspected drug exporter of the apartment owner, a 34-year-old Caian woman.
The respondent denied the accusation and claimed that another man was with him as a shooter.
The incident came to the police when the police stopped a person car where the group was burning the clothes used in the bloodwork.
In addition to the burned clothes, a broken hole was found in the car.
The Court of Appeal will make a judgment later.
In many places it was very warm.
According to the Meteorological Institute, the same warm August repeats on average once every ten years.
The statistics of the Meteorological Institute show that the average temperature in the whole country was higher than usual.
In most countries, the deviation was one to two degrees.
Because of the holidays in July and August, the whole summer became warmer than usual.
The highest temperature of the whole summer was measured in the first week of August in Por, where the meter showed 32.8 degrees.
Lenny Henry says: My father never wanted me.
He never said he loved me.
Henry was born in a seven-born Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, Britain, in 1958.
Henry's father worked in the factory and died when Henry was 19 years old.
Henry is currently training for the Rudy’s Rare Records comedy show, partly based on a imaginary conversation with his father and developed on the basis of the Radio 4 channel series.
The sound is a mixture of reggaeta and rap in upbeat.
Henry has had to go through the painful childhood memories.
She has been frequently in therapy after her mother’s death, and she thinks a lot about her relationship with her father.
My father was very difficult to read.
His face was never seen, only the voice said, “Stop the melt.”
Leave your sister in peace.
Go to!
I look at the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were already adults when I was a child, went to the pub with my father and discussed, for example, the form of a beer lesson or the beauty of a cricket lesson.
I never talked to him about such things.
Most of my life he was for me the smile-free man in the corner, reading his newspaper.
Henry recently opened a metal insulating plant in Dudley and thus got the idea of how his father’s life had to be, although the working conditions are better today than at that time.
The slopes are a little brighter today, but they are practically dark, smoking, labyrinth depths, where flames, smoke, and nock are shining, and which remind you of the darkness.
His father used to go to the bathroom and just go to the ground, and slowly he began singing himself while washing the dirt of the dirt out of himself.
As I walked around the slurry, I realized that he had done that work for years to get us food to the table, and I began to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry's childhood lacked the proximity offered by the parents.
My father never wanted and never said he loved me.
Only when my mother began to get sick a little before her death we began to repeat to each other that we loved each other.
Henry has a daughter of Billie with Dawn French, and through his own child, he has been able to share the love he lacked from himself as a child.
Do you have to repeat “I love you?”
Stop the hunt now!
I am 22!
with Dawn French.
Why are we not friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry is still a good friend with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why don’t Dawn and I be friends?
She is a great mother.
Her mother had diabetes.
It was also one of the reasons that led to the mother's death.
When I began to suffer from a lot of overweight and diabetes symptoms, my doctor ordered me to make a full prescription.
After that I started fitness a lot, and I also had to start a hard diet to reduce my symptoms.
It is very difficult –
and boring.
No one enjoys eating carrots.
Henry's well-known, short track may describe his change during his career development.
After receiving a lot of good feedback from critics about his role as Othellon, he’s immersed in making theater.
The next turn was the Comedy of Erehdyst and August Wilson’s Fences (“Aidat”).
Making theatre offers a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that Henry has done throughout his busy career.
Henry started the industry as a 16-year-old factory worker.
One prince found him on the stage making imitation and contacted the New Faces skills competition.
Henry’s television career began in the mid-1970s. “I’ve been the only black imitator and comedian of the television for a long time,” he says.
Henry learns when he works.
I had to grow up in public lighting, I had to learn how to produce jokes from the slide lighting between 1975 and 1985, while I lived the starlight and was on television.
Lenny New Faces Competition in 1975
Henry's manager was entitled to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment show where people appeared in black shades make-up, so Henry ended up a comic for the show for five years.
My family didn’t like it.
On the other hand, I wish I’d never participated in it, but I don’t regret it.
Although my position was strange and annoying, I got to work on huge events and learned how the audience is treated.
Nevertheless, “British TV’s award-winning, multiannual favourite and light entertainment show” was at the same time “a brilliant parody of black people.”
Henry worked in the 80s in a second comedy series, where both the black British culture was destroyed and admired.
The Lenny Henry Show's first episode was shown in 1984, and in the 1990s Henry was known for his character, including the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Henry spent the next decade on advertising, documentation, television series, and films, but after his LennyHenry.tv series showed on the BBC in 2008, he said to himself, “What are you going to do next, Len – now it seems like you’re just on your place or you’re going on the side routes.”
The next turn was Radio 4's documentary series "What's So Great About...?".
The first part was about Shakespeare.
I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.
It was not really taught to us in school properly, and I think it belonged to a white middle class who was wearing socks and had money.
That’s why Shakespeare’s issue raised me fear.
All the people we interviewed in the program – Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench – said to me: “Experience.
Don’t give up the whole thought until you know what you’re talking about.
Meet the words and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry spoke 20 rays of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was sold.
I felt I could do that.
It was almost as if some part of me had been missing before, and now it was placed on its place.
“This is about it, this is important, so take it seriously, teach your bag, do a small background research.
The training process was thus hard, and I read the show months before it was implemented.
The show was a success.
It seemed to have failed, but it did not happen.
Shortly after that, Henry played the main role in the Erehdyst comedy.
Suddenly I appeared at the British National Theatre, and I couldn’t really believe it was true.
At one point, I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
Once the show had technical problems, and Henry clearly felt that it was his job to entertain the audience.
“A small voice in my mind told me, ‘You have to spend 10 minutes alone until the computer works again.’”
Instead, the director’s assistant announced that the presentation will be continued as soon as the problem has been fixed.
I walked out of the stage, and some of me was feeling relieved.
This is not my duty.
I can leave it to others.
“You are a part of the show, stay in your role.”
Henry “Fences” at the Duchess Theatre
The teaching of the mountainous words to the “Fences” show was challenging.
Panic is a good thing, it makes a person more sustainable.
This show was also well accepted, so it was like a sign from gods; “This is what you have to do.”
This is what Henry says, of course, with a good voice.
So I decided to stay here.
I sincerely love this work.
I love training rooms.
However, Henry is still basically a comedian: the little humorous boys constantly interrupt our conversations as he changes from imitation to another.
Abstaining from stand-up comics is a matter of will, as receiving immediate gratitude from an unknown audience seems dangerous.
If you’re thirsting it constantly, it can lead to swelling.
Sometimes I spend a lot of time at the Apollo Theatre when it feels, but in general it no longer inspires me the same way as before.
I ask Henry if he plans to go on a new stand-up tour.
It produces me a real pleasure to sit with a guide who helps to modify the beginning, middle and end of the whole journey, and I don’t think I will never want to give up that feeling.
Is this his new birth?
I think so.
I like to play –
It is really fun.
There is a story in the show and I am pleased with it.
I love stories.

Kenya to set up a register of officials to remove ‘traffic workers’
Kenya has begun to set up a biometric register of officials in an attempt to remove “traffic workers” from government wages lists.
Employees who did not register within the next two weeks would no longer receive salary, the government's statement was.
The government suspects that thousands will continue to be paid salary after they leave their officials.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to overthrow public sector corruption after his post in 2013.
According to an audit earlier this year, the salary and other financial abuses of the “hunting workers” amounted to at least a million dollars a month.
The government suspects that the salaries will be paid to the account even after the person has died or left the office, BBC’s Wanyama Chebusiri reports of the capital of Nairobi.
All officials must enter the register within the next weeks at the identification centers in order to ensure that their data is stored in a biometric registration form, the government said in a statement.
According to the notice, anyone who does not do this without a reasonable reason will be removed from the salary list.
“This measure will significantly racionalize the public sector because it defines how many people actually work in their functions. In addition, it will clean up the salaries at both levels of the government. It will solve the problem of ‘traffickers’,” says Anne Waiguru, a ministry official responsible for decentralization and planning.
The result for the 2015 financial year may remain a deficit of EUR 25,5 million unless the city adjusts its activities and expenditure in a stressful economic situation.
According to the current budget preparation, the annual deficit remains approximately 9.4 million.
Possible means of enhancement include the extent and level of services, the purchases of services, the sale and subsidies of assets, and the increase in tax and payment revenues.
The investment target of 10 million euros is 8.5 million.
There is no relief to the municipality.
The new obligations imposed on the municipalities, the insufficient increase in tax revenues, the increased unemployment and the reduction of 5% of state shares further weaken the prospects.
The aim of the Economic Seminar is to look for new ways to balance the economy.
The City Government has agreed that savings should be achieved.
The ship must be converted to a strategy target, said City Government Chairman Kimmo Heinonen.
The City Government has returned the proposals to the management group.
The proposals of the City Government will be the basis for the budget preparation at the committee’s financial seminar in Fram on Monday, September 8.
After the delegation seminar, the budget proposal will be submitted through the council processing to the municipal administration and the municipal board.
Tens of Turkish policemen arrested for suspicion of a “fake” government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey for suspicion of “anti-government strikes,” local media sources say.
Police did not comment immediately.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 high-level police officers were among the arrested.
Some of the police were linked to corruption investigations in December, which were targeted by government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, a number of police officers were arrested in Turkey, accused of organizing a large criminal mass and tracking telephones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who served as Prime Minister during that time) said the police actions are part of the Islamist leader Fethullah Gullen's planned action against him and other in power.
Not all children come back to school in Ukraine
Most Ukrainian schools opened their doors on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This is traditionally a significant day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
At the same time, he told the waiting journalists that not all schools have been reopened, but he said he is committed to defending the country for future generations:
The ceremonies of the first day of September were not held in every school.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the whole of the enormous Ukrainian border, must fight for peace.
Aleksan Pastukhov, who served as a leading teacher in the Slavic school where Yatsenyuk’s daughter goes, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally come back here and that children will be able to learn something that will benefit them in the future.
The first school day celebrations traditionally include children's recorded shorts, airballs and giving flowers to teachers.
Texas's Perry says the tweet was unloved
Texas Governor Rick Perry's confirmed Twitter account posted a shocking picture of a Democratic District Attorney during hearing of accusations of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, and followed by a new tweet where Perry swear that he had nothing to do with the picture.
The tweet was sent unlawfully from my account.
“I don’t accept the tweet and I’ve removed it,” it said in a subsequent post.
Perry's background teams did not immediately respond to the clarification requests.
Although the tweet was sent from Perry’s confirmed Twitter account, it’s unclear who posted the picture.
The first tweet included a crazy picture of Travis' district lawyer Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk in April 2013.
Perry stopped the funding of Lehmberg's office as he refused to resign, leading to a large parliamentary meeting in Austin this month when Perry was accused Perry is a potential candidate for the 2016 presidential election.
The title of the tweet was: “I don’t always drive in humble, three times as much as permissible, but when that happens, I accuse Governor Perry of showing the finger.”
I am Texas’s most humble Democrat.
The Lehmberg agency did not lead the investigation of a large jury team against Perry.
The investigation was carried out by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor in San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry has said he is innocent and called the charges a political run.
His influential law enforcement team has asked the judge to reject the accusations and said that the law on the basis of which the Texas's longest-stay governor is accused is unclear against the Constitution.
Perry sparked $7.5 million in state aid to the State Public Innocence Unit operating in Travis County and addressing public sector accusations when Lehmberg refused to leave.
Perry's decision received an official complaint from the left-wing monitoring group.
Perry’s confirmed Twitter account is updated regularly – and sometimes also famously.
As he reached the fifth place in the 2012 Iowa election campaign, Perry threatened to end the balance by posting on Twitter a picture of himself running on the lake with the text “Here we come, South Carolina!”
Berkeley says the housing market is again “normal”
One of the main builders in London has warned that the housing market in Southeast England has “falled” to the normal level of activity.
The capital London’s housing has been treated by a huge demand and a sharp rise in prices while being scared by the widespread credit, which led the British bank to set limits on housing loans in June.
Berkeley’s founder and chairman Tony Pidgley said on Monday that “from the beginning of this financial year, markets and trade numbers have returned to normal since 2013” and added that this has enabled a “stable operating environment”.
The London housing market went well during the recession with foreign investors struggling to the capital.
According to the Sea Register, the prices of apartments in the city rose by 18.5 percent from just the previous year and thus clearly exceeded the average in England and Wales, which was 6.7 percent.
The average price for private, affordable and student buildings in Berkeley increased by about a fifth of the previous year, reaching a price rise of £423,000 by the end of April.
However, a stronger point has made London’s real estate a less attractive spot in the past few months – part of the interest has also been influenced by the new real estate tax laws and the political rhetoric of the possible “carton tax” before the general elections in May.
The London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April housing loan report, in which the stricter loan regulations were, would lead to a lower level of market growth both in relation to real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England showed on Monday that the amount of approved loans fell in July, indicating the cooling of the housing market.
Property broker Hamptons International has calculated its 2015 forecast of London's real estate prices. According to it, prices will fall by three percent because the indice that meets the prices of housing owners has already begun to weaken.
The number of shops made in London’s most expensive areas in Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has dropped by a quarter of the year ago, real estate broker WA Ellis says.
However, the demand for home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley, who increased the revenue from the property sold to over £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added that “the demand for a well-designed, right product in the best locations has remained stable, and thus sales have remained vibrant.”
In June, the company it sold 3,742 new houses in the year before April, which is a third more than in the time of the peak before the economic crisis in 2007.
The annual earnings calculated before taxes increased by 40 percent to the previous year, thus 380 million pounds and turnover increased by 18 percent to 1.6 billion pounds.
Pidgley said on Monday before the company’s annual meeting that the Berkeley year’s revenue meets the current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the entire year's tax-pre-profit is £450 million.
Berkeley’s stock sold at the London Stock Exchange at a price of £23.96.
The hacker scored Jennifer Lawrence's naked pictures on the internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards award ceremony.
The hacker, who claims to hold a hundred other stars pictures, dropped the Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence's pictures on the internet.
A spokesman for the Hunger Games Star confirmed that the images were genuine and condemned the hacker for “small violation of privacy.”
The authorities have been contacted, and everyone who publishes the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will receive accusations.
The images that were originally posted on the 4chan image page had apparently ended in the wrong hands due to the weakness of Apple’s iCloud storage system. Hundreds of other stars on the list are alleged to have dozens of other female stars, such as Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed said.
It is not known how much of the images are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim against the World star Winstead condemned the hacking on Twitter.
“For those who look at the pictures taken years ago in my and my husband’s private home: I hope you have a good mind,” Winstead tweeted.
Nickolodeon’s “iCarly” and “Victorious” series Victoria Justice, however, denied the authenticity of the images and tweeted that “these so-called naked images of me are DESTINATED, don’t you understand.”
Let me make this end right in the beginning.
BuzzFeed announced late Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande's representative denied the authenticity of the stars' images.
Only we appear extract from Howard Jacobson's rewarded new novel that tells about love and j-writing
They dissolved, it described the best of what happened, and gradually they dissolved each other like a box of potatoes left out in the rain.
Only at times he heard from the woman that he was too serious, troubled, intense, distracted, and a little crazy.
Then he shed his hand.
He recognized the puppy.
Yes, he was thick like a silk.
The last victim of his bite was in the early stages a relationship that was promising; it had seemed that this relationship could have relieved his lonely boredness, and it could have even brought some content to his life.
The village of Solomons had untouchable hair, and she was a delicate dancing beauty with a pleasant heart, from the northern village that was even harder and far away from everything than Port Reuben.
He had come to the south with a older traveler, whom Kevern thought to be his aunt. The aunt had inherited a house located in a wet but paradise valley, and the valley was properly named Paradise valley.
There was no one in the house for years.
The tubes flooded, all the bathrooms had spiders, the paths had left their traces on the windows, keeping the whole place in their own, in the garden grown roses that resembled the giant grapes.
The house was like a children's garden, at the same time threatening and magical, a garden full of secrets.
Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” was nominated for the Booker Prize in 2014.
The candidates will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting hand in hand with Ailin's broken terrace chairs in the middle of a long hine, enjoying the surprisingly warm spring afternoon, both listening divertedly to the receptor, through which the whole country heard calming music and calming news, when Ailin's crossed, sun-rushed legs brought Kevern to the mind of a song that had been singed long ago by a forgotten black speaker and that his father had often listened to the mock speakers below.
Your feet are too big.
These songs were initially too aggressive and were no longer recorded at the receiver.
They were not prohibited – nothing was actually prohibited – they were simply not called.
They were forgotten, as the word was forgotten.
The general opinion produced what was not achieved by law and placed by declaration: just as in the field of literature people chose to read the memories of heroes, cookbooks and romance, in terms of music they prefer ballads.
During the day, Kevern began to touch the imaginary piano and sing a serenade on Ailin's big legs with a furious comic voice.
She didn’t understand.
“It was the famous song of jazz pianist Fats Waller,” Kevern told him, and at the same time he lifted two fingers in front of his mouth.
This was what his father had always done before the “J” book came out on his lips.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was small.
His father said he played the same game with his father.
If you release the word starting with j from your mouth, and you don’t remember to lift two fingers in front of your mouth, you’ll have to pay a penny.
It was not a fun game at the time, and it was not that even now.
He knew that it was expected from him, that’s all.
He had to explain what jazz is.
Alain had never heard of that.
Jazz was not prohibited, it was not just called.
Improvisation was no longer in fashion.
There was room for just one word.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The point was the same.
Its unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was a musical show.
Although Kevern had not heard Sammy Davis Junior at the age of 10, jazz music had become known to her through her father's married CD collection.
Well, at least she didn’t have to tell Ailin that Fats Waller was black.
Given the age of Ailin, it was likely that he didn’t remember the time when the popular singers were not black.
There were no laws and no compulsions.
A listening society meant that each of its parts accepted the principle, thanksgiving – thanksgiving, that they were as if they were saved by the trade of happiness – that each group did things that were natural to it.
Based on their temperament and physical characteristics, people with African-Caribbean genetic roots are best suited for entertainment and sports, so they sing and run.
Originally, people from the Indian continent were as naturally talented with electrical equipment, so their task was to ensure that every family had a functional phone that was used to deal with things.
Those who were left of the Polish community worked as pipelines; the latter Greeks broke the tables.
When THAT HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS
Each act according to their gifts.
Ailinn had only heard ballads, and it was hard for her to understand how the insulting words that Kevern just sang had ever been able to wear as music.
Music expressed love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except for the big people.
My father never offended anyone, but this song made him happy.
He had already said too much, but the abandoned garden created an illusion of safety.
None of the words would pass through the sounding of the giant sheet leaves.
But the city didn’t understand.
Why did your father love something like that?
He intended to say that the whole thing was just a joke, but he did not want to raise two fingers to his lips along with Ailin.
She has seen her strange already.
“It was fun for my father,” he said instead.
Ailinn dropped his head unbelievably, and his hair covered the field of view of Kevern.
There is nothing else to see in the whole world than Ailin's enormous, varicose hairstyles.
He did not want to see anything else.
“If you once say that,” he said but didn’t sound convinced.
But it doesn’t explain why you sing it for me.
The house seemed really confused.
Are my legs so big?
He looked again.
Your feet are not big.
You thought, maybe, a bit...
And you hate me because my necks are too thick?
I hate you?
Of course I don’t hate you.
It was just a stupid song.
She could have said “I love you,” but it was too early to do it.
“You’re charming for me because of your thick nails,” he tried to fix the situation.
I’m shaken in that sense.
There was no help for that.
He wanted it to sound funny.
Often, when he wanted to have fun, the effect was completely different, because he, like his father, lacked the convincing charm with which the cruelty of jokes can be controlled.
Per his father had intended to be cruel.
Per he, Kevern, wanted the same.
Despite their gentle eyes.
Ailinn Solomons reddened and rose up on his terrace seat and at the same time dropped the recipient and flushed the wine they had just drunk.
The wine was made only from the back, so he could not use it as a cause of collision.
In her nervousness, she looked trembling like palm leaves in a storm.
“And your thick head is what attracts me in you,” he said.
Except that I don’t feel like that.
Kevern was regretted for Ailin, both for his own, unnecessary cruel words and for the fear that appeared in his eyes at the moment that Ailin decided to stand against him.
Did he think he was hit?
He had never told Kevern about life in the beautiful northern island where he had grown up, but Kevern was sure that it was basically the same as life here too.
The same enormous, brilliant sea that flooded against them.
The same confusing men, even after the murder, even more gentle and cheerful than their deceiters and deceiters, walked from the pub to the pub, ready to beat any woman who would dare to resist or tempt them.
The thick head?
He would still see a thick neck, unless he was cautious!
Smoking first – smoking has become the most common word that describes the erotic encounter between a man and a woman; the recipient’s outpumping meaningless love ballads are a contraceptive – smoking first and then attack.
Kevern also thought it was too much, because absorption in itself was hostile.
Ailinn Solomon's body language urged him to leave.
He pulled himself up from the terrace seat like an old man.
Ailinn also felt exhausted, but the depth of Kever's sadness surprised him.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
Ailinn followed her walk – just as her traveler looked at Kevern’s walk from the upper window – a man who was the cause of his heavy life.
When Adam went out of the garden, he thought.
He felt disappointment with Keverna and men in general, although some of them had raised their hands against him to attack him.
He turned his back, a crazy, shameful, shattered man, who had lost all the fighting – why did he feel that view was so familiar to him, even though he didn’t remember that he had ever seen it before that moment?
When Ailinn Solomons was alone again, he looked at his feet.
A few years before the event just described, the intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher Esme Nussbaum, who worked at the General Opinion Measurement Private Institute in Ofnow, made a short study of the continuation of minor and medium-sized violence in the countries where the decrease of violence, or even the end, was most likely, taking into account the money and energy used to pull it out.
“Many has already been achieved, and much has not yet been done,” he wrote, “to balance the natural aggression of the people who have struggled for thousands of years and mostly defeated, especially in the rejected and remote corners, where, despite the ecclesiastical offices that spread over the past, the humankind is rarely known in the end of time.
However, some things could not be completely eliminated.
The higher the tower, the lower the pleasures it generates.
The people are crying with the sentimental ballads, struggling with the stories of victorious contradictions, and swearing in the name of the goods of marriage and family life, but at the same time the old cruelty keeps both rural communities and urban communities unhappy, and there are also evidence of a new, more evil dispute in homes, workplaces, our streets and even the playgrounds.
“You have a sad tendency to dramatize,” his director commented after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum looked down to the ground.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“To believe I don’t have to answer that,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
We continue to draw up their right to not answer personal questions.
the feminist?
Again the silence.
“I’m not asking,” Luther Rabinowitz said, “because I oppose atheism, lesbianism and feminism.
There are no prejudices in this workplace.
We are servants of an unprecedented society.
Although a certain type of over-sensitivity in itself is completely acceptable and respectable, it can sometimes lead to distorted outcomes, such as what you just presented to me.
You obviously have something against the church – and what you call cruelty or misfortune, others usually call natural energy and physical strength.
Hoking THAT HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS
Esme Nussbaum looked around when Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind Rabinowitz's head, a flamingon pink LED light announced the direction that Ofnow had distributed to the land for a quarter of the previous century or longer.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, and the singed word is better than written, but nothing wins love.
“I understand what you want to say,” Esme Nussbaum answered with a quiet voice when he was sure that his instructors had stopped, “and I just want to say that we are not as effectively healed as we imagine ourselves.
I am worried that if we are not warned, we will find that we repeat the same errors that originally led to THAT HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS HAS.
This time, however, we don’t go out of our hatred and uncertainty to others.
Luther Rabinowitz formed the pyramid.
This act meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “when you’re imagining ‘feil’ the things our grandparents may have done or have not done.
You will also go too far when you say that they’ve throwed ‘their hatred and disconfidence in others’.”
One who is in a position like you should not have to remind that when it comes to understanding the past, or to defend the present, we are not talking about ‘we’ or ‘they’.
There was neither ‘we’ nor ‘other’.
It was a chaos, all we know about it.
“If we are completely honest, in that chaos,” Esme dared to continue, “no group of society can say that they behave well.
I do not blame anyone.
What was done, was done, whether it was good or bad.
It was then.
There is no need to say more about this, we agree.
And just as it is unnecessary to share accusations, there is also no need to make corrections, whether they are appropriate or not, and even if there is a way to do them.
But what does the past exist if it is not taught of it?
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I can add one more...
Luther Rabinowitz broke his pyramid.
“I’m going through your report,” he said and stated that Esmen was time to leave.
The next day, when he went to work as usual, a motorcyclist riding on a walkway hit him, who was described by passengers as “badly and angry.”
The coincidence happens.
Lesotho army rejects planed attack: Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the Lesotho Army have denied the launch of an attack aimed at overthrowing the government and said they are acting against a police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country saying that the army had surrounded his official housing and conquered government buildings in the capital, Maserou.
The head of state travelled with his family to the neighboring country in South Africa after saying he had a deadly threat.
The army’s representative Major Ntlele Ntoi banned the attack and said the army responded to a threat that came from “political fanatics.”
“Lesotho defence forces have taken action after receiving a number of intelligence reports that some police forces are trying to arm young party fanatics while they are ready to cause problems,” he told Voice of America.
South African government president Clayson Monyela said the military’s actions seemed to be a revolutionary initiative.
“Al no entity has claimed to have revoked the government by means of force, the actions of Lesotho’s defence forces appear all over the way corresponding to the characteristics of a revolutionary initiative,” he says.
According to the officials of the Lesotho Army, the soldiers will return to their shelters on Sunday, and the capital was in a quiet atmosphere.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing leads the government while Thaban is absent.
Thabane says he believes he is the subject of action because he has tried to fight corruption.
Tensions have emerged in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended the parliamentary sessions due to disputes in the major coalition government.
He denies that he has reduced the power of the government, although it is claimed otherwise.
Microsoft establishes a data center for New Zealand
The IT company Microsoft has established a large data center for New Zealand in a location that the company does not agree to specify.
In a statement to the media, Microsoft said it did not report the location of all its datacenters for security reasons.
The center, according to Microsoft, is already fully equipped and connected to the network.
It is an investment of several hundred million dollars for Microsoft.
In public, the place of the center was previously covered by Oulu or Kajaani.
Microsoft will completely terminate its office in Oulu, bringing around 500 people to work.
In total, Microsoft has announced that it will dismiss a maximum of 1,050 jobs in Finland.
Microsoft’s communication chief Camilla Lindfors told STT that the company doesn’t comment on how many people the new data center employs.
The data center was established on Monday by the Commercial Journal.
A man accused of driving a girl in a traffic shooting
A 78-year-old man is accused of driving a three-year-old girl in a traffic checkpoint in Fif.
Gordon Stewart is accused of driving a girl on a crossroads in Pittenween, Neuk.
According to the prosecutors, Stewart driven an Audi Q3 car uncertainly and caused the girl injury.
The 78-year-old Stewart, from Anstruther, banned the charges at Dundee's Sheriff's session.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC ordered the trial to be held in January.
4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you want to take pictures or videos under the water, you have to complain about a number of different device options.
The cheapest option is waterproof, compact point-and-shoot camera, such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or action camera, such as GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which both cost about $300.
I took these photos on a family party using a number of different cameras, each of which cost less than $350.
Regardless of the device, there are a few rules that should be followed.
Check your device twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera’s battery and other parts are waterproof closed.
Additionally, set the camera’s image settings to match the images or videos to be taken.
Some cameras or combinations of a camera and a video camera have a setting that allows you to optimize the imaging conditions under the water.
Furthermore – before you jump into the water, make sure how deep your device can take.
Some cameras stand only 5 feet deep, others up to 50-60 feet deep.
Find out both the usual and waterproof models in our purchase guide and digital cameras reviews.
Take a number of pictures – many of them fail in some way.
Compact cameras have an LCD display that allows you to summit the image, while action cameras often do not have this feature.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to see under the water, and the imaging can either succeed or fail.
Take a number of pictures.
In addition, if your camera allows haircuting, which means taking multiple images at a time with different settings, take advantage of this feature.
Stay near the surface.
The light decreases significantly deeper.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you photograph in a swimming pool, lake or sea.
This will also bring more colors to your images; the deeper you go, the less colors will appear.
Try to get close to the point to be described.
This is an important advice on the ground when described, but even more important under the water because the light conditions are scarce.
It is very important when using an action camera: these devices often have a fixed lens with a wide angle of image, i.e. the photographer must be close to the object so that the object fills the entire frame of the image.
China does not allow Hong Kong to choose its leaders – protesters swear to reject
The Chinese parliament decided on Sunday that Hong Kong voters should not be allowed to choose candidates for the 2017 election despite the growing unrest that demands a democratic reform.
The decision is likely to give a curve to Hong Kong’s business world for long-awaited protests after the activists started planning and implementing protests just hours after the decision was published.
The decision of the People's Congress in practice gives the communists the power to dismiss all candidates who do not obey Beijing.
“This was expected, but it’s still annoying,” said Democratic Party’s chairman and legislator Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lie to the people of Hong Kong.
It is clear that we are working with a self-government.
Li Fei, the Vice-Secretary of the People's Congress Committee, defended the Chinese government, saying that being a general candidate to elect Hong Kong's leader would be too "caotic."
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom has surrendered Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised to the residents of the region that it will be allowed to choose its leader from 2017.
According to Chinese leaders, Sunday’s decision was a democratic breakthrough because it would allow Hong Kong to vote in direct elections, but the decision also makes it clear that China wants to strictly control the election process through the appointment committee, which is managed by Beijing.
According to the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be accepted.
In the summer ahead of the decision, Hong Kong held some of the region’s largest and most attracted protests in the years.
The campaign for democracy was largely behind the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to block the action of the business card if Beijing does not grant Hong Kong a genuine public voting right.
On Sunday night, just hours after the decision was published, hundreds of Occupy Central’s supporters gathered in the rain in front of Hong Kong’s main administrative buildings.
In the protests, the organizers announced that the movement would move into a new era of immobility, and they would be able to trigger protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not explain the details apparently, fearing that it would lead to problems with the authorities.
In a statement published online, the organizers said that the movement “vises Occupy Central as the last means that will be introduced only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way.”
We are very sorry to announce that today the last opportunity for dialogue has been broken out and the center overtaking will take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security measures were severe near government main buildings.
In Hong Kong, the unrest is fed by many the feeling that the inhabitants are slowly losing power over their city.
The wave of arrivals from the continent has caused competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is a fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of expression, are going to disappear under Beijing’s increasing pressure.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement because its demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s living conditions – the business world.
“The protests they’re talking about can lead to major financial losses, depending on how many people will take part in it and how long it will last,” says Legislative Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want you to be worried that Hong Kong is getting out of our stake.
This would be a bad idea for investing.
China’s state media has also revealed stories that Hong Kong’s Democracy activists are the subjects of the western powers that flee the revolution.”
This summer, the activists held an informal referendum on voting rights, which attended 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands of people participated in one of the largest demonstrations in the region in favor of democracy.
U.S. Prom Tradition Strikes British Universities: New Students Private Travel
We respond with enthusiasm to our demand by establishing the UK’s first-class luxury travel form for today’s students.
In addition to the private aircraft, the company also offers other carriers such as Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1, so that the customer can ensure the most memorable arrival to the university.
According to Stewart, there is also a security point in the service.
The service is the best possible option for students who would otherwise raise their property across the country in the extreme and loaded cars.
With this combined with many VIF features (VIP friends), we are ready to provide today’s students with the most easy and high-quality transport to the university.
According to the company’s representative, reservations have not yet arrived because the service has just been established, but added that “students will start making orders in the coming weeks.”
The company believes that there is a demand for the service, although most students pay 9,000 pounds of academic fees.
Today’s students are very different in terms of their expectations and desires than 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago they started their studies. Now it’s more important than ever to create a memorable first impression, and VIF is exactly the right way to do it.
However, the national student organization criticizes a service that is not realistic.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Higher Education Division, said that “this service plan seems to be really far from the lives of the majority of students.”
Many of their studies in this month will begin to be shocked by the level of living costs, as the available financial support in the form of loans and scholarships has remained after the dramatic rise in the basic income costs.

The sale of the house has raised interest on social media, where it is asked whether the pig is included in the price of the house.

Basketball: Fans encourage almost too much: Sasu Salin had turned to the field
Basketball Sasu Salin was today the bodybuilding of the Finnish victory.
He was able to forget the silence of his U.S. match and explained the blood of the second half of Ukraine with his standing solutions.
But Salin transferred all honour to the sushi - and did it in the style:
I thought to turn there to the field at the end, that encouragement was so great.
In my eyes, I couldn’t do anything.
The white and white audience was almost too much for me.
The strengths of Salin contained nine surfaces in a fast pace, balls, plates and thumbs wherever it occurred.
I don't know how it went, but I got into a flow state that everything succeeded.
They’re going to go somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere, somewhere.
That is my role.
Do all that.
It was great to see that the other people were getting rid of it.
It caught the whole group.
Salin is the team's thriller and spirit creator, so it's no wonder that his example raised the entire team to the flight, which was too much for the big and hard-course Ukrainian five.
Finland in the World Cup after 32 years of break: The previous one was reminded of a striking judge game
Heikki Montonen was the main coach of Finland at the 1982 World Cup in Argentina.
It has been 32 years since the Finnish men's airball team played the World Cup for the first time.
Seppo Sirkka was the only Finnish photographer in the 1982 tournament in Argentina, where the legendary Reino Kosonen was Finnish double coach and current player agent Jouni Parkkali as general player.
Kosonen and Parkkali remember one thing about the tournament as yesterday: it was in the beginning of the fireful match against France.
“In that match, the judge’s game was striking,” Kosonen remembered.
We had already won, and both teams had already set back.
Suddenly the game continued.
We lost it 2-3, and after that the passes broke even more," Parkkali said.
Finland played with head coach Heikki Montosen and finally ranked 17th.
Finland is now one of the world’s top matches when the World Cup in Poland will start on Saturday.
A lot of things have changed drastically in the international airball over the past 32 years.
Players’ strength values are approximately the same class as before, but quality and skill are now more.
The player’s average length has also increased.
The game is faster,” he said.
How is it in Poland?
The Finnish gaming material has expanded, and the burden can be shared.
I am hoping that Finland will continue to reach the start point.
Then it can become strict,” says Kosonen.
The Cirkus
Olli Nenonen, Jouko Juvonen and Jukka Savio were in a win match against Tunisia.
The current player agent Jouni Parkkali was a general player in the World Cup.
We are hoping to get on the 17th place.
South Korea and Tunisia should go to the corner,” Parkali said.
Regno Kosonen was the national team’s second coach in Argentina.
Jukka Savio, Mauri Leppänen and Kari Körkkö winded in the Tunisia match.
Sauna and dinner at the Maritime District of Buenos Aires were part of the national team’s program at the 1982 World Cup.
Kary Kalin (Oik) sparked with his team members.

Finnish tourists rescued a dog from the mountain Cita in Norway: "These men deserve all thanks"
When the Norwegian Merethe Mikkelsen and her dogs were killed on Thursday in the mountains, Antti and Tuomo Soini were boldly offered help.
On the weekend, Mikkelsen searched for "international heroes" on Facebook to thank their assistants once more.
Mikkelsen said in a public Facebook update that the dog Cita, who was with him on the mountains on Thursday, wounded his neck.
The wounded dog was no longer able to walk in the rough landscape.
I tried to put it down myself, but I failed, so I had to let it be.
I tried many times to attract and pull it a little forward, but its legs didn’t just wear, Mikkelsen writes in his update.
According to Mikkelsen, no assistance came from the police, the nearby hotel, or the passengers.
In the darkness of the night, the situation began to seem threatening.
Fortunately, there were two passengers who were ready to help: the tamper Antti Soini and his father Tuomo.
The men had visited the highest mountain in Norway at Galdhøpiggen and went to their camp where they saw a woman and a dog in the middle of the mountain.
(Mikkelsen) was relatively calm in terms of the situation.
We offered to help him with the dog, Antti Soini says in his message to Ilta-Sanom.
Soon there was a German man who had a trip with him.
From the patch to Cital, a couple of similarities were brought to which the wounded dog was attached.
The German man arrived a moment after us, when we thought what to do with the dog and put the dog in the shell for a moment down from the plate, Soini tells us.
Photo by: Tuomo Soini
The dog was carried down by means of an excursion.
According to Soin, the performance was not physically heavy, but carrying in a difficult ground went slowly.
After about an hour and a half, however, Cita was happy to get down.
After the event, Mikkelsen was still looking for "international heroes" on Facebook to be able to thank them again.
Sounds responded to him on Sunday, but the German man is apparently still unacceptable.
I don’t know what I would have done without these heroes, Mikkelsen is glad.
If they didn’t help me, we’t have returned.
I would like to find these people because I feel I haven’t thanked them enough.
They don’t know how much this means to me.
These men deserve all gratitude and honor, I’m forever grateful to them.
On Monday night, Soini was already home.
They had gotten a pleasant membership from Mikkelsen: - Cita says it can be better!

Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A British woman has been afraid of death for years due to a false diagnosis.
Karin Rodgers thought most of her youth that she had only a few years of life left because she had been diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, he suffered from the Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT). It means a series of hereditary diseases that damage the brain and the extra-spinal nerve.
According to Charity CMT UK, misdiagnosis is a common problem in CMT cases, because so little of them is known.
It is estimated that around 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which causes symptoms in motorcycle, such as muscle weakness, difficulty walking and swelling in the fingers.
The disease can also cause discomfort or pain, and it is irreparable and progressive, meaning that the symptoms will worsen over time.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he thought he was suffering from Friedreich's ataksia (FA), with a really poor survival rate.
Rodgers believed he would fall on a wheelchair before he was 18 and die before he reached the age of 30.
Today, the 51-year-old mother of two children says, “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as others.
I fell down every day and it lasted me longer than everyone else.
I was never able to roll or roll with other children, and I was tempted at school because I was walking and running differently than others.
When Rodgers was 13 years old, he was undergoing several acillosclerosis cuts to redirect his legs. In the course of the cuts from the doctor's room, he quickly looked at his research papers saying he was suffering from FA disease.
“I felt guilty because I was so curious, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I checked the information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA association,” she says.
When I received information from them, I was shocked and in a panic condition.
I thought I would fall on a bicycle chair at the age of 18 and die before I reached 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my ability to operate.
I went through this for myself and designed my own funerals.
Rodgers tells you that at the age of 17, she said that her walking had not worsened as much as she had thought and asked her doctor about it.
The doctor just caught me and said, “Golden boy, I don’t think you have this illness because otherwise you’d already be on a wheelchair.”
I think you suffer from some significantly less dangerous illness.
Based on some genetic tests, he was diagnosed with CMT disease.
“When I was explained what the CMT disease was, I thought I was delayed,” she says.
Charity CMT UK organizes a CMT month to pay attention to the disease.

The municipality of Nastola donated a formulakuski to Valtteri Bottaks a 1.4 hectare coastline from the Kärkjärve beach from Villähte.
The local government demonstrated fairness in the sport and was unanimous in its decision.

Russian Space Shuttle Failed: Sex Travels Kekoes Killed
Five small kicks sent to the Russian space are dead, the Russian Federation’s space agency Roscosmos said in a statement.
Gekos travelled in the photon-M4 satellite for more than a half month.
The satellite returned to the country on Monday morning.
The purpose of the experiment was to investigate the reproductive capacity and use of kicks in a weight-free state.
The test included one male and four women.
Although the experiment sounds strange, its purpose was serious.
About the effects of insufficiency on the development of eggs, for example, is little known.
Through the effects on the gems, it is possible to try to predict what the effects of negligence would have on a person if he stayed in an equivalent condition for longer periods of time, the New Statesman observed in July.
According to Roscosmoks, the deadline and the cause or cause of the death of the kicks are determined.
According to the news agency Interfax, the passengers who were crossed as "sexuals" were frozen.

France arrested terrorist at Nice airport
A suspect was arrested on Saturday at the airport in Nice.
A 22-year-old man is suspected of acting as a recruiter of a jihadist group in Syria.
The French authorities this on Sunday.
The police found the man after he had raised a 16-year-old girl to go to Syria.

The man is from Chechnya, but he is currently living in France.
The French intelligence authorities had been monitoring the man's actions earlier.
In France, the authorities have been concerned that the radicalized youth attracted to the war in Iraq or Syria is a security risk for France as well.
The authorities estimate that about 800 French citizens or French citizens have traveled to Syria during the last conflict, returned from there or are currently planning to leave in Syria.
We have good chances of winning.
The hopes of the basketball team for the next place are in play when Finland faces Ukraine in its second match of the World Cup today.
If the opening gap for the United States was expected, Ukraine will again be one of the countries from which Finland should take the necessary profits for its continuation.
Ukraine is a good team, but I think we have good chances of winning, Peter Koponen predicts.
On Saturday, Ukraine defeated the Dominican Republic 72-62 in its first match.
The team is trained by NBA veteran Mike Fratello, under the command of which Ukraine plays aggressive basketball.
The key player of Ukraine is the game director Eugene "Pooh" Jeter, whose sister Carmelita Jeter is the world champion of a hundred meters for three years.
Jeter scored 16 points against the Dominican Republic.
Pooh Jeter fast left, but yes we have been played against such before and we have to get our standard maintenance in order, Koponen said.
Hanno Möttölä promised that Finland will play better than the United States lost yesterday.
We need to find our strengths again.
I can guarantee that there will be a normal sushi on the field, Möttölä said.
Hollywood stars' alleged naked appearances spread on the internet - part assured true
There are a series of naked images on the Internet that are alleged to represent famous public figures.
Among other things, actress Jennifer Lawrence has been the victim of a "make-up campaign".
The entertainment site TMZ has published a angry comment by Lawrence’s representatives that seems to confirm the authenticity of the images.
This is a violation of privacy.
The authorities have been contacted, and anyone who publishes (online) the stolen images of Jennifer Lawrence will be prosecuted, the representatives threaten.
According to TMZ, actress Mary Elizabeth Winstead has confirmed that the images of her are genuine.
She had taken these pictures years ago with her husband.
When I know that these images were destroyed a long time ago, I can only imagine what hard work for this was seen.
I feel sympathy to everyone who was the victim of the hacking, he writes according to the site.
Instead, the actress Victoria Justice says the pictures passing by her own name are fake.
True or false naked images are also in motion at least of Kate Upton, Kirsten Dunst, Ariana Grand, Hope Sol, Krysten Ritter, Yvonne Strahovsky and Teresa Palmer.
Honka-malivahti criticized his own: "They don't do enough work to get out of here"
The football team FC Honka is currently in the last place in the Veikkaus League.
Painter Walter Viitala's comments after Sunday's VPS match clearly describe the confusing current situation of the team.
I have not been a coach for four months.
But everything needs to be adapted," Viitala said after the 1-2-tape match ended.
Honka made a lot of defensive mistakes in the game, especially in the first half.
The player was not a bad defence game.
Players’ traffic in Hong Kong has been vibrant this summer, and that’s why the defenders in front of Viitala have changed to a strict rate.
With the player's roulette, many young players have also received opportunities that they't even deserve.
“Some people don’t do enough work to get out of here at some point,” Viitala sparked without naming any individual player.
Hongo's chief coach Shefki Kuqi was somewhat in agreement with Viitalan.
"I told certain players after the game that if you come to the training and games to have fun and you think you're a basketball player and you don't have to work, then you're probably in the wrong team," Kuqi said.
I have given a lot of time to young people.
If they don’t want to take that place and use the opportunity for good, then it’s not my fault.
However, Kuqi also reminded that players can’t expect immediate success when the players are constantly changing.
There has not been the same composition twice in a row.
Especially in the field of defence, the group has changed.
That’s the main reason we’re in this place,” Kuqi said.
Honka is after VPS as a series bump, on the second level with the last TPS.
There are still seven rounds left for the Circuit League, so the Espools still have time to avoid falling into the One.
I’ve never played a team, and I’m not going to play now either.
We’re not going to really fall out of this series,” the painter Viitala threatened.
Lars von Trier to make a television series after decades of break
Film director Lars von Trier plans to return as the author of TV series.

Manufacturing company Zentropa that the series’ descriptions should begin in 2016.
Trier is expected to take part in the scripting series from this autumn.
The series is in English.
The mysterious project is also by Trier’s long-term partner, producer Peter Aalbæk Jensen, known for his hard sales speeches.
According to him, the similar series "was never seen and will never come to be seen."
“Stay your breath,” Aalbæk Jensen says in a statement.
Lars von Trier, 58, has been famous over the past few years for his horrible media appearances and films such as Antichrist and Nymphomaniac.
In the 1990s he directed a television series.
01.09.2014 15:20 The Lidl trading chain seems to have taken the Finnish side, at least if there is a belief in the outcome numbers.
The turnover of the Lidl Finland Kommandiittifirmen, which operates in the Commercial Group Lidlin Finland, continued to grow in the financial year that ended in late February.
The company also increased its outcome.
The earnings before taxation exceeded EUR 79.6 million, compared to EUR 56.4 million a year earlier.

The growth was 25%.
The company, which increased its market share, also increased its turnover from 61 million euros to 84 million euros.
The profit rate was 7.1.
The accounting period of the German-owned Lidl will last from the beginning of March to the end of February.
The company said it paid a tax of 13.7 million euros to Finland for the financial year that ended in February.
The company, which has continuously expanded its store chain, has announced that it will invest 100 million euros in Finland this year.
There are currently 142 Lidl shops in Finland and it employs more than 4,000 employees.
The first store was opened in 2002.
The Ice Bucket Challenge takes place
The British Isabelle Roberts cried so hard when she was thrown on a ice cream water that she damaged the bone of her face.
This Ice Bucket challenge ended painfully badly.
The woman was taken to the treatment after she screamed the Ice Bucket challenge when she performed so hard that her leucemia went on her place.
Isabelle Roberts cried so hard when she was throwing ice water on her that she damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I was just crying, but when I was crying, I felt that my lungs began to harden,” he told The Mirror.
The ice water is filled at the age of 20.
Isabelle Roberts a minute before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but I couldn’t, my liver was locked, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister noticed the same thing, and they started laughing, but I had to thank for first aid.
A 20-year-old British, who took part in the supernatural challenge on Tuesday, was taken to a hospital where the leak was placed back to his place.
The video has become a Internet-sensation and has been shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Perspective of the puppy's ulvonta (kin): How can you explain the growth of the fan number?
It was a great fiil today.
This was said by basketball player Sakari Pehkonen in 1995, when Finland had played in the EM final tournament against France at the Athens Marouss Ball Hall.
Not exaggerated.
I remember the game when I was there.
So were also those about a hundred Finns who screamed 20,000 viewers to draw, otherwise empty holy metals.
What would Pehkonen say 19 years later after the World Cup Finland-Ukraine match?
In Bilba, a hundred Finnish firms are eighty-fold.
The 1995 World Cup was a search time for Finnish basketball.
The men raised their way to the final tournament by winning, among other things, the Russian basketball match at the Helsinki Sports Hall.
The victory would open the doors to Europe.
Everything looked good.
There were promising young people, like Hanno Möttölä.
Head coach Henrik Dettmann raised Möttölé to the final tournament team.
A solution that many people disagree.
Now I can say that Dettmann was far wise, even if it wasn’t all going according to the script.
After Athens, the basketball team dropped deep.
At the Athens competition there were more than a hundred Finns.
It included journalists, players' relatives, Finnish basketball coaches and a few fans.
Bilbaos also has journalists, relatives and coaches, but there are also fans.
And there are a lot of them.
The phenomenon has grown to unimaginable proportions.
No one can say the exact number of tourists.
The estimates are between 7,500 and 10,000.
Whatever the number is between, it is an unimaginable number.
Here is an explanation for sports sociologists.
In the global economy, companies are moving across borders.
We still have the opportunity to see how we are going internationally.
With increased mobility, we can go to see how our daughters and sons succeed in the world, says Hannu Itkonen, a professor of sports sociology.
Certainly, both in Spain and in the World Cup, there are Finns in Poland who are looking for experience.
of common experience.
But it does not explain everything.
The sport itself has to be attractive.
It makes the sport a part of the popular culture.
There is a lower threshold to go to the sports competitions than to go to Berlin to watch art.
Without success, the masses cannot move.
Let’s go back to 1995.
At that time, head coach Dettmann challenged the basketball union and the players also got to go to top sports professionally.
It took almost ten years.
Then the direction changed and the country’s business was raised.
The airball team did the same move a little earlier.
Now both enjoy the fruit of work.
As Itkonen says, both species have succeeded in producing their top sports, where the holy Trinity works: sports-media sponsors.
The public is also interested.
And the media has taught what such carnival support is, Itkonen reminds.
Can the ball species transfer this massive interest to domestic series as well?
The basketball and airball are played for an average of hundreds or a little more than a thousand spectators.
The cry sees the question as good, and does not necessarily give a answer that promises very good to species.
The second school believes that the interest will move.
The other is the one who doesn’t want a sweet stomach full.
This group is ready for a lifetime to the World Cup, but in their basic thinking, the homeland series do not interest each other.
It is a challenge for the companions in the middle of the drug.
Insurance for the Bottas Land - almost 1.5 hectares from the lake beach
Nastola will be awarded to the formula driver Valtteri Bottakse with the beach carrier.
The municipal government unanimously approved the delivery of a 1.4 hectare land in its meeting on Monday.
In the future there will be a vacation room.
Nastola has followed the success of Bottas from this karting time.
He is seen as a good ambassador to market in Lahte, the region of Lahte and Nastola.
It is located in Koiskala, on the shore of Kärkjärve.
It has become the property of the municipality of Nastola as part of a larger real estate trade.
There are seven buildings in the district, six of which will be dismantled by the expenditure by the end of this year.
Bottas reached its fourth prize winner this year in the Formula 1 Belgian competition.
He is fifth in the World Cup.
Bottas is a Nostolian native and lived in his childhood.
She lives in England today but goes to Nastola whenever she is free of formulas.
Bottas has visited higher schools and youth halls.
Design smart clothes come - but hardly for the poor
It is presenting and testing them at the U.S. Open tennis competition in New York.
Ralph Lauren’s smart shorts are the balls of the field, but Marcus Giron, an amateur from the top of university players, also believes that.
According to him, the shirt will help him monitor his own development and regulate his recovery.
The nails are weated with silver sensors, from which the information is transmitted to the mock in the shirt and from there further to the smartphone or tablet.
Antors measure the heart rate, breathing rhythm, stress and steps.
The mock that works as a central unit is removed before throwing the shirt into the washing machine.
The fashion house has not stated the exact time for the sale of the shirt and has not even indicated its price, Tech Times.
Raph Lauren is not the only company investing in smart clothing.
The Californian Athos has brought for sale smart shorts and smart shorts.
They measure the heart rate, breath and muscle work.
The clothes cost a hundred dollars per piece, and the central unit of the size of the shirt they require will cost two hundred dollars.
It was also written by Red Orbit.
Intelligent ways to save in books
The cost of university bills in America exceeds $1,000 for many students, so Matt Schroeder, who soon begins his second year of study, invented a smart way to save on costs.
He developed a system in which subsequent year courses students borrow their books for a nominal compensation instead of selling the books forward in the same way.
“My book of mathematics would normally cost $180; I paid $10 for its use for the whole semester and a thousand snacks,” says 19-year-old Schroeder, who studies Covenant College in Georgia.
Schroeder says that his last semester books would normally cost $430.
Instead, he spent $120 on them.
According to the University’s board of directors, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on books and school accessories, but students have a lot of ways to reduce these costs.
Students are becoming more and more likely to use creative approaches such as online stores and the Schroeder idea.
More and more students rent books, allowing them to use the book throughout the semester and pay for it clearly less than students buy the book.
According to Neebo Inc, which holds more than 250 campus libraries, the lease of books has doubled since 2011.
The industry statistics reveal that about a quarter of the books in the university libraries last spring were lease books, Neebo’s chairman Trevor Meyer says.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all books are purchased from campus libraries.
Here are the easiest ways to save clear money.
The online shop
In online stores, a new book can only be obtained at a third of the price it would pay in the campus bookstore.
The recommended price of Ron Larson, Bruce Edward and Robert Hosteller’s ninth edition of the book “Calculus” is almost $290, but from the special books online store Chegg.com the book gets the price of $239.99.
Buy Used
Used books are a good option if the reader is not disturbed by the notes of others and the past appearance.
For example, the “Calculus” book comes from Chegg.com for $93.49.
Brigham Young University’s last year student Matt Casaday, 25 years old, says he bought the book “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” used from the Amazon.com online store for just $0.42.
The new book would cost $48.
Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts' Amherst's College Without Walls, and other academics recommend that students ask their professors if previous pressures can be used on the course.
Sometimes new press reforms are not essential for education.
In this case, the old pressure can only be found at a break-part of the price that should be paid for the new.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon bookstores, eBay Inc’s Half.com is a popular place to buy used books.
Rental
The lease of books is worth considering if you take good care of them, you remember to return them and do not need them for the course you have completed.
By renting you can save more than 80% of the price of the new book.
For example, renting a "Calculus" book for a whole semester costs about $20.
Find out the rules of the rental company, such as notes, the use of the emphasis and the following fees.
The tenant, be cautious: if you forget to return the book, the delay fee may be greater than the book purchase price.
The E-books
Buying e-books instead of ordinary paperbooks can also become a question.
Sometimes these books are rented, paying for the e-book access to its holder, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg or Barnes & Noble Inc.
In the Chegg store, you will get the book “Calculus” as an e-book for six months for about $61.
According to Bracey, many literature students save the most, as many classics can be downloaded for free today, while books in the field of science and technology can be very expensive.
You should compare the different vendors, which option you choose.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon begins Pepperdine in Law, recommends using a good book ISBN number to clarify the price because it can help you make sure you are looking for the right book.
Before you order online, make sure the book is in stock, Gault says.
He himself learns through this way.
The delivery of the book he bought was in ice for four weeks, and he eventually had to purchase the book at a full price from the university bookstore.
The Legion Theatre celebrates 20 years
Founded in 1994, the theater is against unemployment, exclusion and passivity.
Everyone who wants to perform art is welcome.
Organizing entertainment activities for long-term unemployed people aged 17-35 years.
The proposals often take a view on society.
In recent years there has been presented, among other things, the depressive Depression Moderate, I am! - humoristic stories about narcissism as well as classical recommendations.
He believes that every person can change his life.
More than twice the number of people killed in fires than last year.
The number of people killed in the fires this year is double compared to last year.
According to the media surveillance of the Central Organization of the Finnish Rescue Industry (Spek), 55 people have been killed in the fires in 49 different fires.
Last year, the number of firefighters was 31.
The majority of the dead, 36, were men.
The age of 65 is 11.
According to the Organization’s fire death statistics, the worst situation was last in 2009, when 64 people were killed in the fires by the end of August.
Most of the fires occur in apartments.
There have been 17 firefighters, 21 in private houses, and seven in line and other small houses.
Spek reminds us of the fire safety of the house.
At least the functionality of all home fire alarms should be guaranteed by Spek.
Furthermore, everyone should check that the initial removal tools are easily enabled.
All of the premises of the house must also have an unhindered exit route.
Children should also be told what electrical equipment they can use when alone at home.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
NATO opponents protested in Newport last weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the city centre of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in the Cardiff City Hall for the so-called counter-top.
Stephen Fairclough followed the events on the weekend and spoke with the protesters who had arrived even from Belgium.
Young people rescued from the Blue Mountains in Australia
Two teenagers were saved after they were stuck on the Blue Mountains in New South Wales, Australia.
A 16-year-old girl and a 18-year-old man went on a walk after midday to Govetts Leap to Blackheath on Sunday.
Parents worried about the young people who had not returned home, and called the police at eight in the evening.
A local police and assistant search party was sent to search for the young, and the twin was found around 23 a.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had broken her knee, and the man had fallen and hit her head.
The police spent the night with the couple, and they were brought to safety on Monday morning.
The passengers were taken with an ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital, and their condition was stable.
Ukrainian soldiers withdraw from Luhansk airport
Ukrainian troops have withdrawn from Luhansk airport.
The Ukrainian army said the soldiers had been sentenced to retreat.
According to the Ukrainian news agency, the U.S. Air Force has strictly joined Russian tanks on the ground.
According to a military representative, the opponent's shooting was so accurate that the shooter is likely to be Russian professional soldiers.
Seven Ukrainian soldiers have been killed.
The Ukrainian ships drowned in the Asovan Sea in the south-eastern part of Ukraine in the morning, the border guard said.
Eight sailors have been rescued and two are still missing.
The police did not know where the ship was shot.
Separatists on social media that they shot the ship.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia will not attack Ukraine.
However, Lavrov urged the Ukrainian forces to immediately withdraw to stations from which they cannot shoot civilians.
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in the Minsk negotiations today between Russia, Ukraine and the EU, an immediate ceasefire should be carried out without conditions.
Lavrov also said that Russia will respond to possible new economic sanctions.
First, we will protect our own interests, our economy, our social sector, our.
At the same time, we will also draw conclusions about the actions of our partners, Lavrov threatened.
Heavy rain flooded in Malmö and Copenhagen
The streets flooded on Sunday in Malmö and Copenhagen, as heavy rainfall stormed southern Sweden and Denmark.
Floods broke several roads, mixed traffic and buried cars alone.
On Sunday, the authorities estimated that the flood relief could last, although the rain was forecast to cease on Monday.
Heavy rains were surprised by the Swedish authorities and no weather warning was given in advance.
The meteorologist Ari Mustala of the Finnish Meteorological Institute estimates that the sadding was very local.
The rain area looks narrow and stable.
No wonder it was hard to predict.
The French socialists should “be silent and help France,” Francois Hollande said.
Valls urged the deeply divided left to “show their feelings” toward a difficult socialist president whose new government was not approved by the French majority.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, our support.
“Our task is to stay with him,” Valls said and deserved the applodes.
As a calming gesture, the Prime Minister called on the government to leave peace despite the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite the discussion that the new economic minister Emmanuel Macron gave earlier this week on the proposal that the rule should be revoked.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to cooperate with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christiane Taubira caused disagreement by appearing at the meeting of the Socialist Parliament and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing “France to give up the hope for the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the extreme right-wing national front, blamed the continued mutual distinction between the socialists and said that he did not believe the new Valls government will last a few months longer.
Francois Hollande may have gone calling for war, but so was Manuel Valls, whose duty was to form a new government after the previous one did not last even for the summer.
“And the new government will not last until autumn or winter,” Le Pen told reporters.
He repeated his party's proposal to dissolve the parliament and held sure his party would win in early elections and he himself would be ready to lead the party.
The ruling party in France suffered a breakdown in March’s municipal elections and the extreme right holds a list key in May’s EU elections.
According to a survey by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party may split into several competing groups before the end of the Dutch season in 2017.
The post-university political researcher Pascal Perrineau warned that the French would soon lose their patience unless the new socialist government succeeded in improving the economy and record high unemployment.
“There is a small chance of success, but the public must quickly realize that the change is happening,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get worse.
At the end of the year, Finnish drillers Kirsi Alm-Siira, Nina Rahkolan and meteorologist Pekka Pouda's pokka deceived the program's recorded part.
Tomenta Suomi on Thursday posted a fun video on its Facebook page about the recordings made on Thursday.
In the video, the shooters Kirsi Alm-Siira and Nina Rahkola and the meteorologist Pekka Pouta try to record Huomenta Finland's advertising poff from the next day's broadcast, but the recording doesn't go exactly into the tube.
Alm-Siira confuses with his words when he tries to speak the word budgetary, and his shock also makes Pouda and Rahkolan lose their pockets once after once.
And these heroes should be allowed to pull the direct broadcast even tomorrow, according to Huomenta Finland's Facebook update.
The video has become very popular on Facebook and has been both liked and shared on Facebook more than 10,000 times.
Jorma K. Pouta, 68, who worked at the photo office of the newspaper, ranked third in the series in 1972.
Israel's Prime Minister Golda Meir.
The Socialist International Meeting was held in the Building Masters House in Helsinki in May 1971.
There were a lot of people at the meeting and the security measures were huge.
When Golda Meir went to the bathroom, seven life guards were accompanied.
At the beginning of the meeting, however, we had a lot of five minutes of time to photograph.
I took this picture 4 meters away.
The light and the background were together.
Soon I realized that this time I succeeded.
Meir appears to see that the leaders of the Middle East have had a difficult time before.
In this event, you will be able to compete with images taken from known persons or events.
It is great that today you can succeed with other images as long as there is an idea and a visual curve.
This is the second best picture I’ve taken.
The best is Lasse Virén's falling picture from the Munich Olympics.
I didn’t send it to the competition.
The Aarnio study has already paid more than 5 million euros.
The investigation of the legality of the activity of the Helsinki police drug unit has already cost more than five million euros and required 30-50 years of work.
This is what Jyri Rajamäki assessed in his dissertation on information technology to the University of Jyväskylä.
Rajamäki suggests that the monitoring of the legality of police activities and the fight against crime in general could be significantly improved by combining the information technology systems for investigation and justice.
According to the limits, modern technology enables multiple use of criminal technical materials.
It states that it is possible to build a system where the information collected to investigate a criminal offence is automatically the electronic evidence that fills the proof chain and at the same time enables comprehensive legal control.
The claim will be reviewed on Saturday.
Overview: The 1999 concept of vegetable food was forgotten on the school wall: "Fish and chicken foods belong to the vegetable diet"
The photo of a special report on the wall of the Okkalan Women's Journey School caused a food store on social media, Yle says on its website.
The vegetarian!
The plant diet includes fish and chicken foods.
Only when the list has meat, we prepare a plant option!
This is stated in a forgotten, 15 year old report on the school wall.
You can see the picture here.
The image spread on social media has led people to send an annoying feedback to the municipality of Pirkkala.
The head of food and cleaning services, Arja Vaarma, tells Ylelle that the fold that was forgotten on the wall is not true and should have been removed a long time ago.
Obviously, before my arrival, there was sometimes such an idea that was discussed in time with health care.
Every student receives a meal according to his wishes, he says.
Today, in the Pirkkala schools, students are offered a plant diet option only with the permission of the parents and with a doctor or health care provider’s certificate of the plant diet.
The danger justifies the solution to the above by the fact that youth’s plant-food tests may leave nutrition in a shortage and the lack of meat or chicken can raise wonder from the parents of the students.
Norwegian Cruise Close to $3 Billion Prestige Cruise Contract
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise company, is negotiating to buy its competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for $3 billion.
The Norwegian Cruise, which has a market value of $6.8 billion, will take advantage of Prestige Cruises’ luxury cruises and wealthy customers as it continues to compete against the larger Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
According to the sources, information about the possible agreement may be published already this week, although it is also possible that negotiations will not bring results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private capital investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of the Norwegian Cruise company.
The sources did not want their names to be published because negotiations are not held in public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to the requests for comments and the representative of Apollo refused to comment.
The Norwegian Cruise company operating in Miami has 13 cruise vessels covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its turnover increased by 13 percent from 2012 to 2013, with a turnover of $2.57 billion.
Prestige Cruises, which operates as well as Miami, runs under the Oceania and Regent brand names, including a total of eight cruise vessels, and the route map covers Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
Its turnover in 2013 was $1.2 billion, which is six percent more than the previous year.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of developing economies in the coming years, such as China and India’s middle classes.
Companies are competing to become the first option for these new customers when they choose a crossroads.
Prestige Cruises registered its first stock release on the U.S. stock market in January 2014.
Apollo has owned most of the company’s shares after the 2007 trade, worth $850 million.
Norwegian Cruise was founded in its current composition in 2000 with its association with the cruise company Genting Bhd (GENT.KL). the latter is the entertainment and casino company of the Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested a billion dollars in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise was listed as a public company in January 2013.
According to the information published, Genting’s share of the company was 28 percent, Apollo’s 20 percent, and private capital company TPG Capital LP’s 8 percent from the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise share 82 per cent of North American cruise capacity, according to the registration document published in the context of the Prestige Cruise shares.
The City Council is discussing the issue today.
The House of Representatives wishes the City Government to support the initiative.
According to Animalia’s executive director, Salla Tuomivaara, who is preparing a dissertation to the University of Tampere, the time of the delfinaries in Finland and around the world should be terminated promptly.
Fortunately, in recent years around the world, there has been a widespread view that the pot of advanced mammals like dolphins in the dolphinaries is neither animal protection nor ethically sustainable.
This is expected to apply to Turkey as well.
The termination of the delphinarium is not only a question of animal rights, but also a question of Tampere’s image as a tourist destination, Tuomivaara notes.
According to the judge, the death of Näsi-delphin confirms the demands for the delphinary operations.
Näs's death is a sad continuation to the dark history of the Särkänniemen delfinarium.
It is time to put a point to death, to close the delphin prison, and to begin to find out how the delphins of Tampere could be transferred to a bordered sea area, to a kind of delphin shelter.
It was unlikely to experience the return to the original habitat of the dolphins, but hopefully the rest of the dolphins living in the Sharkman could experience more life than their untouched concrete.
Animal Conservation Union (Animalia) aims to prohibit the use of all species of wild animals in circles in the preparations of the Animal Conservation Act.
There are also delfinaries.
To support the request, Animalia’s operating director Tuomivaara will participate in the demonstration on behalf of the dolphins that will be held today on 1.9.
The Japanese Embassy in Helsinki held a demonstration against the beginning of the delphin hunting year in Japan.
During the hunting period, approximately 2,300 dolphins are captured or brutally killed annually, either for delphinary purposes or for food.
Putin calls on Kiev to open negotiations with Eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday demanded that the Ukrainian government stop the struggles against separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state” of the region, Russian news sources say.
His representative, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine territory would become part of Russia, but that its position within Ukraine should be re-examined in order to give the population of the Russian-speaking region the power to defend their own rights and interests.
Putin's demand to the Kiev government to negotiate with the Russian-minded rebels as equal negotiating partners corresponds to his obvious strategy that he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he seeks to help separatists take over the territory and thus force the Ukrainian government in practice to grant the soon proclaimed Novorossi independence, allowing it to turn to Russia rather than to the West.
In an interview with the State Channel 1 television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian army’s efforts to regain the separatist-controlled eastern Donetsk and Luhansk territory, which separatists occupied in March and April by joining Moscow to the Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently buried the region as a “Novorossija”, a “New Russia” – this term reminds the days of glory before the revolutions of the great power of Russia.
According to the Russian news agency Itar-Tass, Putin said the planned peace talks are a “illusion” as long as Ukrainian politicians carry out campaigns for the parliamentary elections on 26 October and government troops attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
“We need to immediately begin broad negotiations, not only on technical aspects, but also on the organization of society and the status of the state of Southeast Ukraine.
Putin’s reference to “state” is related to a broader independence, which has been discussed for months with the leadership of Kiev in an attempt to dismantle the fears of the Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights will be threatened.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the independence they need, Peskov says.
“There cannot be discussions between Ukraine and Russia, because it’s not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict between Ukraine.”
The Kremlin representative’s interim comment, intended to correct the “fake interpretation” of Putin’s comments, emphasized that the Russian government is treating the separatist rebellion in the eastern regions in a different way than in the case of Crimea, when it practically dominated a region with a majority of ethnic Russians in the population of 2 million.
Moscow would be much more difficult to connect even to the Donetsk or Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, because the majority of the 6.5 million people in the region are ethnically non-Russian and because the majority of the population, according to pre-conflict opinions, supported the stay in Ukraine.
The independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed on international forums, would give the local governments of Ukraine the right to agree on their own trade agreements and foreign relations, giving the Kremlin practically the power in the territory that connects Russia with the Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, which was attached to Russia five months ago, the main fleet of Russia, as well as commercial maritime port areas and historic coastal sites are located.
The area between Russia’s Rostov and Crimea also has mines, factories and metal insulating plants that produce vital products for the Russian army.
On 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that the Ukrainian legislators – after the new elections – consider constitutional amendments in order to increase the decision-making power of the regions apart from the Ukrainian nuclear area on their own economy and the status of languages.
However, his vision of independence seems to be strictly different from the view of the Kremlin and Moscow’s possibly armed and floating separatists.
Putin presented his latest demands to the Kiev government for negotiations with the Russian-minded rebels as equal partners after the rebels advanced more last week after Russian tanks and troops invaded eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful area on the Azov Sea coast.
The Ukrainian security authorities are afraid that the occupation of the Russian-backed separatist city of Novoazovsky will be the beginning of a greater effort to conquer the entire strategically significant coastal area up to Crimea.
It has led to the massive strengthening of the city of Mariupol by civilians and military personnel. Half-million inhabitants, Mariupol is known as a steel-produced port city, located between the narrow land area that leads to the Novoazovsky and the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke to the EU leaders on Saturday in Brussels, calling for further measures to prevent Russia's future violations in Ukraine, the former Soviet Republic, which has been independent for 23 years.
“We will soon reach a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko warned.
There are thousands of foreign soldiers and tanks in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not make direct action decisions; the leaders proposed the preparation of additional sanctions to be implemented if the crisis in Ukraine reappears under unclear circumstances.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their stations in the Ilovaisk region after two Russian pansary offices and 1,000 soldiers moved to the Donetsk region last week to strengthen the troubled separatists, General Andriy Lysenko, representative of the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters on Saturday in Kiev.
According to Lysenko, the first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers invaded by Russia in Ilovaisk was exchanged to 10 Russian aircraft helicopters who were arrested on the territory of Ukraine a week ago.
The opening goal was made by the Japanese Keisuke Honda in the seventh minute of the game.
In the second half, first Sulley Muntari and a little later Jeremy Menez hit the punishment.
Laziok got a hardback at the end of the game, but Diego Lopez refused to shoot Antonio Candreva.
Lopez moved to Milan for a time from Real Madrid.
At the training debut of the former attacker in Inzaghi in Milan, the San Siro stadium was just on its side.
A total of 39,000 spectators were announced.
Australian journalists and Gabi Grecko in the round of the naked picture scandal
Geoffrey Edelsten has announced that he has been stumbled by hackers who may have stolen the naked images of his bride and Hollywood A-list star Gabi Greck.
The entertainment world has fallen down after a series of naked photographs of Jennifer Lawrence were published on the internet as a result of a widespread celebrity scandal.
The hackers have said they have a total of 60 naked images of the Hunger Games star Lawrence and other superstars, including the top model Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grand and Lea Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Also the images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovsky and Greck, who live in Melbourne, are apparently stolen in the context of the iCloud shooting.
The list contains the names of 101 celebrities.
Edelsten, who touched Greece last month, told the Confidential newspaper, “this is imaginative.”
All personal contacts and images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread.
Greckon, who is in New York, said the incident was “horrible” and said the victims “feelded.”
The hackers are believed to have 30 images of Palmer with this former boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two images of Palmer on the upper edge of the pool.
Palmer’s films include the film “Love and Honor” with counteracting Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and Sucker Punch actor Browning did not comment on the hacked images yesterday.
A representative of Lawrence told TMZ that “there is a brutal violation of privacy.”
Actress Seth Rogen was angry with the hackers on Twitter: “Publishing stolen images does not differ in any way from selling stolen products.”
The publication of the stolen images should not be made possible, only from a legal perspective.
Finland played almost as at home and rose to a sensational victory from Cuba in the World Cup.
Look at the pictures of the fan room.
Polish Katowice was white on Monday: not Polish red and white but Finnish blue and white.
The Finnish win was followed by 2,000 Finnish fans on the Spodek Arena, according to STT.
It felt like he was playing at home.
So great influence the fans had on our games, the Finnish captain Antti Siltala told STT.
Finland was in the match with a loss of 0-2, but rose to victory with a loss of 3-2.
In the fourth round, Finland made the miracle behind six points.
Cuba led the race already 16-10, but after that the Finnish got the hurricane over.
However, hundreds of Finnish fans were disappointed when an on the field, the charter was unable to land because of the hard battle in Katowice.
Thus, the fans who ended in Warsaw delayed the match.
The Finnish football fans have conquered Europe at a heavy pace in recent days.
At the World Cup in Bilbao, Spain, there are more than 8,000 Finnish fans.
As if every Finnish basket was a winning basket, the U.S. star Stephen Curry cried the Finnish basketball fans after the match on Saturday.
