Members of the National Assembly for Wales worried they'd be compared to Muppets
There is a stir among the Members of the National Assembly of Wales over a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal follows plans to change the current name of the Welsh Assembly to Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly from various political parties are concerned that the new name will be seen as ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly for Wales from the Labour Party said that MWP rhyme with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for poop.
A member of the National Assembly for Wales from the Plaid party said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was open to the name change, but noted that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context the Welsh letter W is pronounced as a short u.
The National Assembly for Wales Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to implement the name change, said: It is of course the members of the National Assembly for Wales themselves who make the final decision on their new title.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave members of the National Assembly for Wales the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be renamed Parliament.
As regards the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Committee proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation.
At present, the members of the National Assembly are proposing alternatives, but Chairman Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, as she must table a bill on the changes in a few weeks.
The legislation on the reforms also includes other changes to the way the National Assembly operates, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
The members of the National Assembly will be able to vote definitively on their new title when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing their country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular referendum was organized in an attempt to resolve a lingering dispute with neighboring Greece, which has a province of its own called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor means that it would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's applications to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who is against the referendum on the name change, has said he will not take into account the result of the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent, those of Harlem are having a hard time
"The older people I spoke to said that there used to be a cafe and a church on every corner here", Mr. Adams said.
Today, there is no café or church.
He said it's understandable that cafes are gone.
People now have a different way of social contact, he said.
Cafés are no longer the neighborhood living room where people regularly stop by.
He is concerned, however, that the proceeds from the sale of the churches' assets will not last as long as the leaders expect, let alone go back to where they started.
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by apartment buildings with flats housing the kind of people who won't help in the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white, he says, which will lead to these churches closing even faster, as the people who move into these flats are unlikely to become members of the church community.
Both churches were built by a white congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original congregation of white Methodists left in the 1930's.
A black church congregation in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the shopkeepers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem where blacks could rarely get jobs or get promotions.
In 1939 the building was severely damaged by fire, but when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the church, they also purchased a porch.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Reverend Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell "the bell of the poor".
The expert who played the harpsichord in July referred to the instrument in a different way: a cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first chorus ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger chorus of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that Saint Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some hired by the lay leaders of the church, others by the diocese.
The consistory (the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay leaders) wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would want to pass on the costs to the consistory, although the consistory had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dived for lobsters in California
On Saturday, the first day of lobster season, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy diving for lobsters in California.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. today near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving for about half an hour with friends on Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming because he had caught a crab, but then he realized that the boy was screaming: "I've been bitten!
I was bitten!
His collarbone was all open, Hammel saw as he approached the boy.
I yelled for everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"
The boy was flown by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reportedly in life-threatening condition.
It is not known which shark species is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted nearby a few weeks earlier, but that it was then concluded that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was severely injured in the upper body.
Authorities closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is looking to break into the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and sets up beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in department stores.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the UK beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods continue to fall.The larger beauty departments are being tested in 11 stores across the country.If they prove successful, they will be introduced in even more stores next year.
The investment in the beauty market is also a consequence of the fact that supermarkets want to replace the shelves of TVs, microwave ovens and interior products with other products.
Sainsbury's plans to double its beauty offerings to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be expanded, with showroom per brand, as in shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique make-up, now that most products are vegan-friendly, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, the fragrance will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, south London, the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
As more people shop online and buy small amounts of food at local supermarkets on a daily basis, supermarkets have to do more to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain competes with discount retailers Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos outlets into hundreds of stores and has also opened a number of Habitats since the acquisition of both chains two years ago.
Last time the supermarket tried to make over its Beauty and Pharmacy departments, it flopped.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership was terminated when a conflict arose over the distribution of revenues from the pharmacy division in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacy departments in the stores three years ago for a sum of 125 million British pounds to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding a comprehensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely redesigned our beauty department to make it more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialised training of our staff, who will be ready to give advice.
With our range of brands, we offer something for everyone, and thanks to the attractive environment and convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products from us, and no longer shop the old way.
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby backs out of £11m deal
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is "angry" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has pulled out of an £11m deal with his lifestyle company to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for Truly, their brand of homewear and accessories.
The Jones and Willoughby company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones of Dragons Den is furious at Holly Willoughby for withdrawing at the last minute from their lucrative lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "angry" when Willoughby announced during a tough meeting at the company's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday that her new contracts (worth up to £1.5 million) would not allow her enough time for Truly, their homewear and accessories brand.
The company is sometimes compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune of an estimated £11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left for one of his holiday homes abroad.
A source said "Truly" was one of Holly's top priorities.
It would secure its future in the long run, and provide enough for the next decades.
Everyone was stunned when she decided to retire.
No one could believe their ears last Tuesday, because the launch was scheduled for soon.
The warehouse at the headquarters in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the presenter, one of Britain's most profitable stars, could cost the company millions, due to the large investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear, and because the launch could now face further delays.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, became the company's president in March.
The two couples often go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will soon be M&S's brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of the British channel ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We have no comment on his business dealings".
Harsh language  And then it was love between us'
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media for a remark he made that some people would find "inappropriate for a president", and for his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a news anchor when he said:
I didn't give up anything.
He added that Kim is interested in a second meeting, and Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore as a major step toward dismantling North Korea's nuclear weapons.
But negotiations on eliminating nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told United Nations General Assembly leaders that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after North Korea's first disarmament initiatives.
Meanwhile, the United States is continuing its sanctions to keep the pressure on, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech at the election rally.
"We're doing very well in North Korea", he said.
We were close to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, with missile tests ended, hostages released and the remains of American soldiers returned to their homeland.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island, killing hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was left homeless, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for international aid to be launched.
In many cases, unfortunately, it is clear that they are not seeking international help, which is difficult for us, said Ms Sumbung.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not certain that the foreign aid workers will be able to work on site.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said Indonesian officials were still evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly plagued by earthquakes, the country is still particularly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh, shelters were built to protect against tsunamis, but these are rare along other coasts.
The absence of a tsunami warning in Palu, even though a tsunami warning was in effect, probably contributed to the death toll.
Even under ideal conditions, traveling from one Indonesian island to another can be difficult.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the disaster site.
Improving Indonesia's poor infrastructure was a focus of President Joko Widodo's election campaign, and he has already spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But President Joko's government is facing a funding shortfall, and that's while he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority now follow a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes an impressive equaliser against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a loss to Chelsea in the Premier League last Saturday, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri as he stood about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, at the moment his team were 1-0 down.
He tapped left on the ball and then kicked in the direction of the far pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty area, towards the upper right corner of the net.
He evaded Kepa Arrizabalaga's jump and fell into the net.
"It was very difficult to get to that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq always play as far forward as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching and I took a chance, I didn't really think about it, I just kicked the ball.
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kovacic, then he rushed through midfield to the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle of the field.
Then he gave a nice punch pass, which allowed Hazard to reach the penalty area.
Hazard was faster than the defence and kicked the ball with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker into the net, next to the back post.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 3pm, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the national disaster relief agency said Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that had collapsed as a result of last Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake, which also produced waves 20 feet high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, is littered with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after wife stabbed to death
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, after which a murder investigation was opened.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street with stab wounds, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking local residents to report if they've seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation has only just begun, but I would like to ask anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, to contact us if they have any footage from a dash cam, as they may have information that is essential to our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found inside a building.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have confirmed that they are currently notifying the victim's family.
A cab driver who lives in Grayson Mews tried to enter his apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what happened.
Residents are now being told that it will be hours before they can return home.
A police officer would have told someone that the area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene, crying.
She keeps saying, "Oh, that's too bad".
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the detention center and a third was just outside.
Inside the compound, a number of officers were watching the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, with log 247 dated September 30.
Statue of Cromwell in the British Parliament is latest victim of the 'rewriting history' riot
The ban of the statue would be poetic justice for the Taliban-like destruction of the many cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: It was inevitable that the current debate over the removal of statues would lead to the targeting of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses of Parliament.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion prevailing in the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure many still consider to be deserving of recognition.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more so at the end of the 19th century than today, to be the defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether that is a completely correct representation is still debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and commemorated.
Murder-sucking pig kills Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, whose last name is only known as Yuan, was found dead at a stable in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, his artery punctured and he was covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inoculate pigs at a pigsty in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, May 30, 2005.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his nephew found him dead and found a door to a neighboring pigsty open.
According to the cousin, there was a large male pig with blood on his mouth in the pigsty.
A forensic investigation revealed that the 250-kilogram pig killed the farmer, the report said.
My nephew's legs were bloody and mutilated, said the nephew, whose last name is Wu, according to the Guiyang Evening News newspaper.
CCTV footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
A market official told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking others while police gathered evidence on the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and the market authorities are currently negotiating compensation for his death.
It's rare, but there have been cases of pigs attacking humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba testified to CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can provoke aggression.
They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious, not out to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.
The tail of Hurricane Rosa brings heavy rain to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it reaches the cooler waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring heavy rains to northern Mexico and the southwest in the coming days.
With winds of 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. local time Sunday morning, and was located 400 miles (620 km) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, tropical moisture is being pushed northward, toward the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring 10 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture reacting with the approaching trough will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause two to three inches of rainfall per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
We're expecting two to three inches of rain in parts of the southwest, especially over most of Arizona.
Sudden floods are possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions, because tropical rainfall can be very spread out.
It is strongly discouraged to go into the desert on foot when the threat of tropical rain is imminent.
The heavy rainfall can turn ravines into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will produce local gusty winds and dust.
The approaching trough is bringing some heavy rain to parts of the Southern California coastline.
There's a chance of an inch of rain, which could lead to small debris flows and slippery roads.
This would be the region's first rainfall in the rainy season.
Scattered tropical rains will approach Arizona Sunday night through Monday morning, after which the rain will spread more on Monday afternoon and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, temperatures in the United States can fluctuate greatly as the Arctic gets cooler, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to large temperature differences over short distances.
There's a nice example of impressive temperature differences in the central United States on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is nearly 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the lingering summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, October is expected to start warm, with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] everywhere from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
In New York, Tuesday can be 27 degrees, which is about 10 degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States until mid-October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh hearing.
More than 20 million people watched on Thursday on one of six television networks the poignant testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an alleged assault in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political impasse continued as broadcasters interrupted regular programming for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the indictment for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she's 100 percent sure that a drunk Kavanaugh groped her and tried to strip her during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in an impassioned testimony that he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
Probably more than the 20.4 million people Nielsen reported watching on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures were not immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people looking in an office.
For comparison, that's about the same as a play-off of a football game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, which supports Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership on the day of the hearing, averaging 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
The public remained very interested after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the events of Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his vote, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters yelling at him as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood there for a few minutes with his eyes downcast as he was being reviled, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
Someone shouted, "You have power, whereas so many women are powerless".
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various networks were broadcasting everything live as the Judiciary Committee was voting hours later on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only vote in favor on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee by next week, something the minority Democrats are insisting on.
Flake was persuaded by his friend Chris Coons, a senator and Democrat.
Flake made his decision after talking to Coons and several senators.
Flake's choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political game' over Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing a political game" with Britain's future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview on the same front page, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson highlighted his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying her proposal that Britain and the EU collect each other's taxes was "absurd".
Police arrest Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of the death of the LSU quarterback
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting that killed Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is in jail on suspicion of manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, reports WAFB, a CBS television station.
The police questioned Simpson and later stated that he had confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
His bail has been set at $350,000, reports The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge County coroner released a preliminary report Friday that stated the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The report states that the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation that led to an arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "effort and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6'2" and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "broken" and "in shock" by Waydes' death.
This is an event you always hope will never happen, says Wade.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City
Ash spewed by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded in a 24-hour period.
The center detected multiple rumbling and vibrations.
Photos of a thin layer of ash appeared on the windows of Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco, on social media.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, the first time since September 2017, when a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists clashed with riot police as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia's independence vote that split the region into two factions.
A group of masked pro-separatists, stopped by riot police, shot the officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, clashes broke out with the police, and the officers pulled out their batons to stop the fighting.
For more than an hour pro-independence groups chanted: Don't forget, don't forgive, while their opponents chanted Long live Spain.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions continue to rise in the pro-independence region, a year after the referendum on 1 October, which Madrid considers illegal but is being celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent, although turnout was low and people who are against secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region, leading to violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups had camped on the site overnight from Friday to Saturday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's prospects for independence.
Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck", he said.
Although the pro-independence parties in Catalonia won a crucial victory in the regional elections in December, even if it was a narrow one, it has been difficult for them to build on their success this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are absent, either in self-imposed exile or in prison awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"Tensions are rising", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he will contest the European Parliament elections next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government, he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after house was hit by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car was repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston gave them the win
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and handed Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a run of 18 games since he has been manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came on equal footing with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have failed to win a Premiership game this season and face leader Hearts on Sunday, who have an eight-point lead.
But first, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, remains undefeated, the team now has six straight wins in their division, and Coach Holt hasn't suffered a single defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston is missing chances against strong visitors.
Holt's team could have gotten a head start long before the first goal, because their direct style of play was causing all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish with a goal, then Alan Lithgow, who took Craig Halkett's header, kicked the ball over the goal.
The home team let the Rangers play with great pleasure, waiting for their chances calmly and confidently.
And that led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free kick and Livingston opened the scoring, but Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create an opportunity for Menga, who scored from the penalty area.
By this point, the Rangers had already had possession of the ball for quite some time, but the home team's defense was unassailable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to do.
That pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure Kelly avoided a goal.
Scott Pittman kicked the ball into Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow missed the goal after a pass from his teammates from Livingston.
Continuing to reach the penalty area of Livingston, they were denied a penalty kick twice, once after Halkett's attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and once for handball.
Livingston's "phenomenon" - the analysis of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal achievement and result for Livingston.
They played exceptionally well and continue to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their squad has barely changed since their return to the top regions, but Holt especially deserves much credit for the way he has whipped the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic, with a superbly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes the entire game.
The Rangers, however, were unable to break through.
Although they have played very well under Gerrard many times, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final stage was not good enough (they only managed to beat the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they need to play better.
Erdogan receives mixed feelings in Cologne
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany had breakfast together in Berlin on Saturday.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aims to restore relations between the NATO allies.
They disagree on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then left for Cologne for the opening of a gigantic new mosque.
Cologne is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security concerns when they prevented the crowd of 25,000 from gathering outside the mosque, but many sympathizers came close to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurds, also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The rival protests reflect the division over a visitor who is hailed by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Motorcyclist dies after colliding with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance staff was present, but the man died at the scene.
A few months ago another cyclist died in a hit-and-run on Childers Street, about a mile from the accident on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and will notify his immediate family.
The road has been closed in several places, buses are being diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in disorderly conduct
Six guards were injured in a disturbance at a high-security men's prison, according to the prison department.
The riots broke out at around 9.30am local time on Sunday at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialist Tornado sweepers have been deployed to deal with a situation involving eight prisoners in one ward.
The guards were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with a recent incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and those responsible will at least be referred to the police and may have to stay behind bars for longer.
HMP Long Lartin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison's director had been treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the riot police were called to jail for a serious disorderly conduct that involved attacking staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (with potential positive effects on drought areas)
It's rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, because the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa is moving southwest across the desert region, posing flood risks.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to be over Phoenix on Tuesday, but it's expected to rain Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict two to three inches of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to six inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the southwest desert region, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to get 3 to 5 centimeters of rain, and here and there 10 centimeters are possible.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, since the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a matter of great concern, some of this rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map of current drought areas, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa's path reaches the mainland via the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still at hurricane strength with maximum winds of 140 km/h on Sunday morning, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is hitting cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean, weakening it.
So it is expected to make landfall in Mexico Monday afternoon or evening with the force of a tropical storm.
Heavy rainfall may fall in parts of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
A total of 8 to 15 centimeters of precipitation is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with up to 25 centimeters possible, weather.com reported.
Rosa will move northward over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then moving through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger expected from Rosa or her tail is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert area", said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and debris flows in the deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace neighborhood of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Police are asking anyone who may have filmed anything of what happened to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has constantly "suffered from the meanness, the anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified Thursday before Congress and strongly and emotionally denied Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her allegation.
The president said on Saturday that the "American people" saw the "bright and incredible character, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to recognize Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to recognize one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record", he told the crowd in West Virginia.
The president made an indirect reference to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections in our lives will take place.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part, he said.
That's why I'm always up for great candidates.
Trump declared that the Democrats are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a top GOP official told CNN.
Hundreds dead from Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and toll rising
A major earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, with many swept away from the ground when giant waves washed up on the beach, authorities said Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves as high as 20 feet (6 meters) hit the land as darkness fell, crushing many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami threat started yesterday, there were still people on the beach, they didn't run away immediately and became victims of the tsunami", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency, during a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami also led to other dangers: it swept away cars, tree trunks, houses, it hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had travelled at 800 km/h across the open sea before reaching the coastline.
Some people climbed a tree to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos released by the disaster relief agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges warped and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city continued to be shaken by aftershocks.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the force of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said some of the dead were trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, while some 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be even higher along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala is completely down, we have no information at all", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement.Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse", the Red Cross said.
The organization was widely criticized on Saturday for not saying a tsunami had hit Palu, although staff said the waves had reached the country within the time the warning was given.
Amateur footage shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building in panic yelling at people on the street below to warn them of an approaching tsunami.
Minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with relief supplies from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but evacuees still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami death toll rises to over 800.
It's very bad.
While World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the courtyard of their office are sheltering in canopy tents, they passed scenes of destruction along the way, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups began the difficult task of getting the relief effort under way, some complained that some foreign aid workers with extensive expertise could not travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, goods and personnel can only be admitted if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
It is still a provincial-level disaster, said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, O.K., this is a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been declared.
As the second night after Friday's earthquake and tsunami hit Palu, friends and family of the missing kept hoping that they would find their loved ones alive, as in the miracles that people love to hear about in terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days with her mother's body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which took place in Indonesia earlier this month.
His students were also trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi.
As a veteran of the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional burden, he said.
Mr. Gendon said that news that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed had spread throughout the paragliding community and that in the hours following, he had been sending desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages only showed one gray checkmark instead of two blue ones.
"I think that means the messages haven't been delivered", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver had just emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was trying to fill it with cash, said Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was doing so, another man ran after Brink's employee and stole a bag of cash that was ready to be delivered.
Witnesses saw multiple suspects flee, the press release said, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information regarding the identities of the perpetrators is requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: The being formally known as Kanye West.
The 41-year-old West has been known as Ye for a while and used this nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to introduce his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her performance during the show for "emotional reasons", the show's creator says.
Ye is not just an abbreviation of his current stage name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
I think ye is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you, West said earlier this year, when he was talking about the title of his album to radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, we are it.
I've gone from Kanye, which means "the only", to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.
He's not the only famous rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs was formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced this year his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has worked with West before, has also worked with and without the hyphen and the capital letters.
Mexican President vows not to use force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country marks the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use military force to oppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, military forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young Mexicans by giving monthly student grants and opening more free public universities.
He said that youths often join criminal gangs because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double its funding of AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on AI research, says investor and AI specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
He says this in response to the announcements about AI coming from various departments of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China announced last year its plan to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chance that the next big achievement for AI will happen in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading A.I. companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat the best player in American Othello, and later he was a manager at Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese division.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organized by the U.S. government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would take place, as it would help to discover the next visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"China does not take our best academics, the companies do", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting the best minds from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the U.S. effort in the field of A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
Anyone who gets a PhD in AI should automatically be offered a green card, he said.
The Chinese National Council released its next-generation artificial intelligence development plan in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to academic staff, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia in the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it would be investing $2 billion in its AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing over $100 million in AI research.
However, the US legislation that should have led to the creation of a national security commission on artificial intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible name change
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country to Republic of North Macedonia, which would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and would no longer hinder Greece's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says that the name of its northern neighbor implies that the country claims Greek territory.
The two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name in June, but nationalists say the name change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign is not certain to achieve the required turnout of at least 50 percent, which may make the referendum invalid.
The question on the ballot is as follows: Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us, said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MEPs have indicated that they will respect the result, making it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Electoral Commission said that as of 1 p.m. there had been no reports of irregularities.
However, turnout was only 16 percent at the time, compared to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters turned out to vote.
"I am here to vote because it is important for my children, our place is in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 during the referendum on the country's name change that would pave the way for membership of NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and set up chairs for tents set up by people boycotting the referendum.
We are in favour of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as full members, not through a backdoor, Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
He said that a "yes" would be "a confirmation of our future" as a result.
An opinion poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of that, 70 percent would vote yes.
If the referendum is to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes Brighton's full defence and scores
Last Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took down Brighton's defence at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and Manchester City won the game 2-0.
It was a piece of cake, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got the ball first in the midfield.
He raced through three Brighton defenders, right into the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He was able to pass a defender and was also too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he made a left-hand pass, where Sterling was waiting.
The England striker used his first action in the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to beat goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
Aguero suffers from foot problems, Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told the press.
We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at that moment.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues their first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's field.
He sent a beautiful left-footed pass to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball for a moment and then sent Sterling to the second post.
The Sky Blues player just hit the ball just before he was too far.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12.55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play ball and not make it easy for the Rockies to make the playoffs .
Now that the Washington Nationals have been eliminated from playoff contention, there wasn't much reason to force a fresh start.
Still, the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to play the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if there are consequences for the Rockies' play-offs.
The Rockies have at least secured a wild card berth in the playoffs thanks to their 5-2 win over the Nationals last Friday, but they're now looking to do everything they can to secure their first division title.
Although there's nothing left for us, at least we can pitch knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with this crowd will be optimal and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I'd encounter this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be a part of that?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will be on Sunday's pitch, but are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, who was scheduled to make his 34th start, was in the infield Thursday and was still pitching next Sunday, although that's normally his day off.
The right-handed pitcher from Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court, while speaking about the importance of the Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
Everything we have already achieved is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections of our lives will take place.
This is one of the really big elections. I'm not running, but I'm actually running. That's why I'm standing up for great candidates everywhere", he said.
Trump continued: "We're seeing a terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, we're seeing it happening now.
And they're determined to take back power, no matter what they have to do to do it.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control, because that's what they want: power and control, but we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "resist and hinder us".
"And we've seen that over the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "angry and mean and false and lying".
He mentioned the name of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to loud cheers from the audience.
Do you remember what she said?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting on one... that was really bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
I am, after all, the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told we are not welcome simply because we say what we think.
My colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar way because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the censorship motion because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, similar issues like this one where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.
And that was true for most of the GC meetings on Friday nights during the eight years that I have been a local Labour MP.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today and the promise of a kinder, softer politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a dissenting opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the leadership or not.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who, as far as I knew, had similar political views to me, suddenly expected me to make a turnaround and take a position that I would never have otherwise agreed to, from issues like national security to the European single market.
Every time I speak to an audience, whatever I say, there are social media scoldings calling for me to be rejected as an MP for the next election, denouncing the politics of the centre and telling me that I should not be a Labour member.
And that's just what I'm going through.
I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments made to me are generally political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist reactions every day, but who do not allow themselves to be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that severe verbal abuse seems to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every "motion of no confidence" or change in selection rules the party gets smaller.
I have often been advised over the last two years to keep quiet, not to speak out and I would not get in trouble.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since joining Labour 32 years ago as a schoolboy, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect of my classroom, I have always advocated better public services for those who need them most, both in my role as a councillor and in my role as a minister.
I've never kept my politics a secret, not even during the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East was clear about my policy positions and my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who pushed the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country is being dragged into a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But I actually have only one message, and it is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy for the next election or political opportunities will not deter me from acting in what I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38-17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr on the way to the top
Two late tries may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt Ayr will rightfully triumph in this delightful match of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They're now at the top of the standings, the only undefeated team in the Big Ten.
In the end, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that brought home the win, and coach Peter Murchie was allowed to be satisfied.
We've had a tough time in our games so far and we're still unbeaten, so I'm a lucky man, he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose: All credit to Ayr, they have used their chances better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, completed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a lead, but a yellow card from Rory Hughes of the Scottish national team (which he received during the Warriors game) allowed Melrose to make the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to break a try.
Climo scored a penalty to give Ayr an extra lead and converted after a solo before halftime, making it 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
The match was abandoned for a long time due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off on a stretcher, and once the match was restarted Ayr could be eliminated by a try from Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion from Climo.
Then captain Blair Macpherson of Ayr was given a yellow card, and again Melrose took out the extra man when no conversion followed a try from Bruce Colvine at the end of a very high pressure match.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, MacPherson, behind the advancing Ayr mound, scored a touchdown on the penalty line-out.
Climo made the conversion, and did so almost immediately after the restart again, after Kyle Rowe took the box kick from David Armstrong and sent halfback Gregor Henry away for the home team's fifth try.
Star of Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It looks like actor Ford Kieran from Still Game is going into the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in alongside his comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was looking for a way to join the "flourishing restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a Navy outfit in La Paz.
The flag is ocean blue.
On all the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto reads: "The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back.
Throughout Bolivia, which is surrounded by land, the memory of the coastline that the country had to cede to Chile after a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean again.
That hope may have reached its highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, due on 1 October after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the outcome with positive prospects, said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the court's ruling on big screens, hoping that the Hague tribunal will argue in favor of Bolivia that Chile, after decades of heated talks, is obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial re-election bid next year, much is at stake with Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor, and even if it did, little would change.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant Chilean territory and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the ruling by the International Court of Justice comes just six months after the closing arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result for Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, the situation may have worsened over the past four years.
The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian government, said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has completely undermined any goodwill that Chile might have had, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point resume their talks, but it will be extremely difficult to continue talking afterwards.
The two countries have not had an ambassador in each other's country since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, he said, Bolivia would have "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of international relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of differences, with mutual benefits".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, is using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean, he added.
The ruling is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove its nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He was speaking at a time when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a "utopia" that the continued sanctions and U.S. objection to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking important steps in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is skepticism and doubts that Pyongyang is serious when it says it would give up an arsenal that the country probably sees as its only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge headgear, soon to be on sale near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or to keep the sun out of your eyes completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a range of crazy oversized headgear for their SS19 collection on the runway, a standout move during Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats were on Instagram this summer and these designers have been putting their dazzling creations on the runway.
Valentino's signature piece was a giant beige hat with a feathery, wide brim that hung over the models' eyes.
Other oversized accessories were watermelons filled with gems, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had their lips sewn shut, more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One creation looked like scuba gear, complete with snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a melted ice cube.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion watchers predict that the huge hats will find their way to the clothing stores near you.
The giant hats may have been inspired by "La Bomba", the straw hat with a two-meter-wide rim that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical hat that popped up everywhere on social media also led to another great creation on the runway: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the bathing suit model that was carrying the bag.
The red-orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and finished with a white leather stud, was the most striking piece in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, and with the designer having made such a huge impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for extra-large accessories".
John Edward: Language skills essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland have an outstanding record of academic excellence, and this has continued in 2018 with a series of further excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community-wide initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their pupils for secondary and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailored school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable subjects of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you hit their head.
When you talk to him in his own language, you reach his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and bonds of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent exam results this year, we can conclude that languages are at the top of the ranking, with the highest pass rates among independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages scored highly.
Data collected from 74 SCIS-affiliated schools showed that 72 percent of students scored high (A) in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French and 63 percent of students in Spanish also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given as much importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the barriers to filling jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with such a skill for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an edge over the competition.
According to a YouGov poll of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to engage in conversation, with French the only language that stood above 10 percent, with a total of 15 percent.
This is why investing in language education is important for today's children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those of emerging economies, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, schools choose which languages they teach.
Some schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that are most important to the UK as they look ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever their future.
It cannot be denied at present that languages remain vital to the future of the country in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be considered as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut Sunday against the Lakers in San Diego.
Fans who are waiting for LeBron James' first game against the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
We're still trying to decide how many minutes he's gonna play.
"There will be more than one, and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James will likely play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games to prepare", he said.
Trump's campaign rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, at a long series of campaign rallies.
It's the first of five planned rallies for Trump in the coming week, including stops in places he cares about, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on his preferred nominee for the Supreme Court vacancy on hold, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the vote is held in November.
What time does Trump's rally in West Virginia start tonight and how are you watching online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set to begin tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via the live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely talk about this week's hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have been heated up as Kavanaugh is accused of sexual misconduct and the Senate may wait a week to vote on his nomination while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republican candidates running for office in November get more momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five rallies next week are meant to "boost volunteers and supporters, while the Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives", Reuters reports.
"Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president is traveling to as many states as possible as the busy campaign season begins", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered in the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday marks the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is trailing in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep hope alive in the lead-up to Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes might have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swing of chance is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that players really believe in, and especially in leagues like this.
So who's got the best shot at this right now?
They used to have a six-point lead, and now it's only four more, so we kind of feel like luck is on our side right now, Jordan Spieth said before he left at the end of the day.
Europe has the advantage of having four points, of course, when there are 12 points left.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give them courage, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and scored three points each out of four.
Spieth has been a formidable opponent from tee to green and he sets a good example.
The typical throat sounds he makes when he plays well grew louder as his round progressed and he made a crucial putt that made Game Four a success as he and Thomas trailed by two points after two games.
His putt that won the game at 15 was followed by a similar scream, the kind that you can deduce he believes the American team is undefeated.
"You have to dig deep and only worry about your own game", Spieth said.
That's all these players can do right now.
18 holes to make your mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but delightful European duo has four out of four and can do no wrong.
Moliwood was the only duo that didn't play bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogey.
Because of that series, and the way they seem to be exchanging energy with their noisy crowd, they're the players to beat on Sunday.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
It is, however, too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut short Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero of that morning, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine left the Spaniard and the Swede behind, and they couldn't get over it.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you catch up.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to watch through the interactions between the duo, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
The European team has been playing well so far and has a nice lead going into the final day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA is willing to fight, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe is off to a great start on the final day of the Ryder Cup, with Saturday's four-balls and foursomes leading the United States 10-6.
The spirited duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team to two more wins than Tiger Woods, who was having a hard time, giving them a four-point lead in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wants to win back the trophy they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, was stronger than the blundering Americans in the four-balls this morning, with a score of 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches but could no longer catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needs to score eight points in Sunday's 12 singles games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood, are only the second duo in Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening four matches after a sensational weekend.
After they had Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were playing beautifully against each other, beating a disappointing Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, occasionally showed some brilliant moves, but he's now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested for the four-balls of the morning, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the world number one and number three, by 2&1.
Yet, Europe was not on a slippery slope on this pleasant, breezy day southwest of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who has won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the American record with three points on Saturday.
They won after a difficult match with 2&1 from Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It's only happened twice before in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has been able to catch up a four-point lead at the start of the singles, although Furyk's team has plenty of draw time as they currently hold the trophy.
But with the team in second place for two days, a counterattack on Sunday seems too high-handed.
North Korea says it will "in no case" unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions are leading to growing distrust in the United States and that under such circumstances the country could not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important goodwill measures" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and pledging not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
We do not see a corresponding reaction from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will under no circumstances unilaterally disarm.
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, with North Korea being rewarded as it moves further, it was striking that he did not a priori disapprove of unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first-ever summit between an active US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim promised to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is insisting on denuclearization first and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a compelling manner and even by objecting to declaration of end of war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an air castle of people who are ignorant about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only reinforce our mistrust.
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something the US leader did suggest earlier this week at the United Nations.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: If the other party in this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.
Yet the tone of Ri's speech was significantly different from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be aimed at the US mainland after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "missile man" on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to completely destroy North Korea, praised Kim at the United Nations this year for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said much more still needed to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for this: "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and firmly until we achieve complete, definitive, verified denuclearization".
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea to sharply reduce funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go well.
Barely hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, North Korea accused him of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised during a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States "takes appropriate measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he wanted were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore, and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year is getting all students to get more sleep in an effort to combat the growing macho culture where it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist affiliated with Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the course, which, as far as he knows, is unique in the United States.
He got the idea to start the course after giving a talk on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I only hearing this now, in my senior year?'
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being offered for the first time this year, will explain to students the basics of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance and also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to host the course when it was determined that students were severely sleep deprived during the week.
The course lasts one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, students see a picture of a dorm room, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise machines and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another part, participants will learn how sleep deprivation increases the long-term risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Using a campus map, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know all this, just as people have a right to know what the effects of their choice of cigarettes are on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of one-night stands, he says, is still alive, and modern technology and increasing pressure on students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough, good-quality sleep should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said, and even to prevent weight gain, since lack of sleep causes the brain to give them a constant feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who is studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to write the course, having taken lessons from the professor last year when he was a first-year student at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar curriculum before coming to the competing institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set an alarm for bedtime, not just an alarm for getting up, but also to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" from electronic screens and LED lights, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal makes Gerrard's men go down
The Rangers again saw their away game disappointing as Dolly Menga scored and beat Steven Gerrard's weak team 1-0 in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were hoping for their first away win since beating St Johnstone 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's side suffered the defeat, just Gerrard's second as manager in 18 games, and now trail Hearts by eight points, who remain at the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes into the half, and the Rangers failed to score the equaliser.
The Rangers are now down to sixth, Livingston is up to third, with only a goal difference from Hibernian.
And the Rangers could be in even more trouble as border judge Calum Spence was treated for a head injury after apparently being thrown an object by the visitors' team's supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes to his squad, passing Ayr and going into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained in the same team for Livingston, who the Hearts managed to snag a point last week, and he would have been thrilled at the way his well-trained team was able to block the opponents with every move.
The Rangers may have had the most possession, but Livingston did more with it.
They should have scored after two minutes, when Menga delivered the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had Allan McGregor's goal in his sights, but the midfielder could not finish it.
A deep free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow kicked against the back post.
The Rangers did manage to take control, but they seemed to be hoping for a good outcome rather than really believing in getting close to the target.
Alfredo Morelos at least felt entitled to a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless collided after 15 minutes of play, but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's request.
The Rangers were only able to score twice in the first half, but Liam Kelly, who had previously been Ibrox goalkeeper, could easily stop Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Livingston's opener in the 34th minute should not be allowed to be in the extension of the general game, no one can deny that they deserved this, if only because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers were no match for Jacobs' deep-lying play.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained cool and chose Menga, who kicked the ball into the goal with ease.
Gerrard made an interception with the Coulibaly/Ryan Kent trade, which had almost immediate consequences when the winger passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly raced away from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept forcing the visitors to play a game of the sort that Livingston likes to play, with Lithgow and Halkett continuing to kick long balls.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor held firm and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgow came wide from the corner.
Rangers' alternate Glenn Middleton requested a penalty kick late in the game after a collision with Jacobs, but Thomson was looking the other way again.
Almanak: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the almanac of our Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago today, for those who can count correctly, the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has since become a staple of science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in Bells or Coronado, a 1950 film starring the seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What the hell is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
If you put these headphones on, you can hear the effect of the atoms that are released by the radioactivity in the minerals.
It's really popping now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see malignant cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells
Vaccination teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient to modify them in a lab
They can then see a protein  common in many cancers  and then be injected again
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells saw her ovarian cancer disappear over 18 months
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, then modifying the cells in the lab to detect the HER2 protein commonly found in all types of cancer, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 stimulates the growth of various types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and teach these cells to target cancer cells has previously been shown to work in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West takes a pro-Trump swipe and wears a MAGA hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go as he hoped.
Kanye West was booed on a Saturday Night Live broadcast after a disjointed performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After delivering his third number of the night, Ghost Town, wearing a hat that read Make America Great Again, he issued a tirade against the Democrats and repeated his support for Trump.
 Often when I talk to a white person, they ask,  How can you sympathize with Trump? He's a racist!
If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago, he said.
The Saturday Night Live broadcast began with a parody of Hollywood star Matt Damon playing the dragon with Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding the alleged assault that Christine Blasey Ford accuses him of.
West's rant didn't get aired, but comedian Chris Rock posted it on social media.
It's not clear if Rock's mail is gonna be a drag on West.
West also complained to the audience that he had been under fire backstage for his hat.
They were teasing me backstage.
They said, "Don't go on stage with that hat".
They teased me!
And then they call me apathetic", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You want to see how apathetic it looks?" He said he'd put on his Superman cape, "because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Give me some love.
The audience shouted at least twice and the cast of SNL seemed embarrassed, according to Variety.
West was a guest as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with a performance of the song I Love It while dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: To one of our bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR DEFIING THE MASS.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "just being herself, and that's beautiful".
But I choose NOT to reward (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his art) anyone who supports and spews an ideology that harms my community.
He's free to do what he wants.
We too", she added.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and that from now on, he is, he says, "the being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Fellow rapper Snoop Dogg also went by the name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince once changed his name to a symbol and then to The artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The accusation will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington is taking a beating at toxic masculinity.
Kit Harington is best known for his role as swordsman Jon Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor attacks the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that young boys often think that they have to be tough to get respect when they see such roles on screen.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt that "something is missing" and asked himself how to address the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he strongly believes the problem needs to be addressed.
"This is a really important question for me personally right now: Where did our masculinity go wrong?" he said.
"What did we teach men growing up that now puts us in this predicament?"
Kit thinks television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, through its very masculine characters.
He said, "What was born and what was taught?"
What is being taught on television and on the street that makes young boys think they have to be a certain kind of man?
And I think that's one of the big questions today: How do we change that?
Because something is clearly wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be acting in any prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, because he is "done with battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he feels his meeting his wife Rose is the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife during the show, so that's how I left my future family and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China in the past through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared with the same period last year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been decriminalized in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly widespread.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Often the diseases are transmitted through inadequate protection during sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked information from Republican senators and calls it "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories".
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters is challenging allegations that one of her staff members posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the accusations are being spread by "far-right" bettors and websites.
"Lies, lies and more vile lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include, among other things, the private address and private phone number of U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address that indicates the source of the posts was linked to Waters' office and contained information from a Waters employee, the Hill said.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a blatant lie, Waters said.
My employee, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a blatant lie.
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial sounds angry", wrote Fleischer.
You can tell from this that she doesn't have the temperament to be a congresswoman.
If someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not be angry.
We mustn't let him rebel.
He should not question the prosecution's motives.
He needs to stay calm and composed.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's response to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Hard, if it's true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified the relevant agencies and law enforcement of these false allegations.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified, she said, and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.
Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
In every new British-themed film, we now traditionally look for references to Brexit, and that does, in fact, turn out to be true of this revival of the Johnny English franchise, the comedy action films starring a weak spy, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satire about how badly we're doing becoming the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English, with his bulging eyes and flexible facial features, manages to do everything he can, even with his second comeback.
He's, of course, the silly secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamour, has a little Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a twist of the guy who contributed one note to the theme song to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is originally based on the traveller and international mystery man that Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard TV commercials (which everyone has since forgotten) which always leaves a certain chaos behind.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I loved the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in his medieval armor and the rotor blades tapping against his helmet.
Atkinson can show how much talent he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor is rather weak and crazy enough to overdo it, especially now that the Serious  film series like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves include comedy as an ingredient, and do it well.
The humor seems more for children than adults, and Johnny English's mad disaster seems to me less original and focused than the wordless jokes of the character Bean played by Atkinson.
The constant theme now is that Britain is in great trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, revealing the identities of all active British secret agents, much to the dismay of the agent in charge, an unfortunate minor role for Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that's pouring down the bucket of the Prime Minister, a pretentious woman with problems on her head and terribly unpopular as a politician.
According to her intelligence advisers, she should use a retired spy, since any active spy is compromised.
And that means the stumbling Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolteacher in a fancy institution, but teaches off the books about undercover work.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former pathetic sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, his wife a submarine captain, a volatile and jubilant role below Vicki Pepperdine's level.
So the Batman and Robin from the disastrous conditions of Her Majesty's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on their odyssey of wild, wild fun: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant, they make a scene aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
For the latter, all the records are opened, but as well-meaning and turbulent as the scene is, it is reminiscent of children's television.
It's all not very original.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I ask myself, can the British film industry really not come up with a role that honors the talent of Rowan Atkinson?
Labour denies the party is planning a plan whereby Britons work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is reportedly considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants corporate bosses to pass on the savings they make from the Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) revolution to their employees by giving them an extra day off.
This allows workers to enjoy a three-day weekend and still earn the same amount.
Sources say the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and plans to shift the balance of power in the workers' direction.
The transition to a four-day workweek has already been endorsed by the Federation of Trade Unions, which sees it as a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an objective that fits within the Party's efforts to shift the balance of the economy more in favour of workers and that also fits within the Party's overall industrial strategy".
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party already promised a four-day workweek in the 2017 national election campaign.
The aim, however, is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not a policy of the party and is not being considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to make clear his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the "faceless executives" and the "profiteers" at utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not get their full share value back, as a Labour government could apply 'reductions' based on perceived misconduct.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees on corporate boards and to set up inclusive ownership funds which give 10 per cent of the shares of private sector firms to employees who can earn up to £500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising questions about whether the FBI's findings could cause Republican senators to withdraw their support for the nominee.
In an interview aired Sunday on "60 Minutes", correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI might discover something that might cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open about this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told the court before the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the accusation came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was resolute, determined, unambiguous".
Graham's voice, however, seems to be wall-to-wall.
"My opinion of Brett Kavanaugh is firm and the charge should contain dynamite", he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one named by her could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I see no new developments".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York, the Global Citizen Festival is an annual music event that will feature a very impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission: ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, tens of thousands of people will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park for the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness for the real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, first organized in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international advocates who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
Concertgoers who wanted a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP ticket) had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise meaningfully raising awareness of the goal: ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with 12 years to go to reach this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a suitable way to convince people to demand a call to action or is this just another form of "clicktivism", making people feel like they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that more than 19 million supporter "actions" have been registered, targeting a wide variety of causes.
According to Global Citizen, these actions have helped world leaders commit and make policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that will change the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 initiatives and declarations based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised through sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds raised have so far impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the key statements of intent is that of The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and executives with the aim of "helping children reach their full potential", which pledged $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history", Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that after sending over 5,000 actions asking the UK government to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government has announced support for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the Global Citizen website asking "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group replied, "It's going to be a long and difficult road, and we're going to fall and fail at times.
But, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will ultimately succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York City hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States may use the navy for a blockade to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can use the navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East, Ryan Zinke, the US Secretary of State, said, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just like in Eastern Europe and the southern flank of Europe", he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to counteract this.
"The United States has that ability, with the Navy, to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to guests at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that bills itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia with Iran's and noted that they are not fundamentally different.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to more or less use and replace fuels", he said, referring to Russia as a country with only an 'art' with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration tries to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, a country that offers by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this reason, Trump administration officials, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its view of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trum said has made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, which will double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy should not be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", said Aleksandr Novak, Russia's energy minister, after meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy minister, in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI), the leading industrial organization in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren "seriously considering" running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, said Saturday that she is "seriously considering" running for president after the midterm elections.
At a local rally in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and that includes a woman in the top job", she said, according to political news outlet The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the town hall rally, saying he was "steering this country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply troubled by what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and of Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "of course we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this".
However, a poll published Thursday found that a majority of Warren's own supporters believe she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a poll by Suffolk University's Political Research Center and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent were in favor of her running.
The poll showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats who have been linked to a possible run in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, senator from Vermont.
Biden said he would officially make a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about PTSD from Track Palin during a campaign rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining the service in September.
He was arrested and charged after a domestic violence report Monday night.
"What my own son has to go through, what he's going through now that he's back, I understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning with", she told an audience attending a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other veterans "they come back a little different, they come back and they've gotten louder, they come back and they wonder if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other military people have given for the homeland".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and is charged with domestic violence and assaulting a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal protest against a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and Washington, D.C., filed a friend-of-the-court brief in a Washington court last Friday in support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case of Grace v. Sessions filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been released.
She says that her partner "and his violent gang-member sons" abused her but that U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
Lawyers for the states supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where many of the people seeking asylum in the United States come from, as countries with major problems in gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, D.C., said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and such an obstacle is contrary to that principle", the statement from the "friend of the court" states.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants entry to the United States harms the U.S. economy because these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and "provide the country with the necessary labor force".
Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, in June ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang-related violence.
"Asylum is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, that people face every day, all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation also worsened.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, more bodies are arriving in ambulances.
And clean water is scarce".
Residents returned to their destroyed homes and searched through their wet possessions for valuables they could still use.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals are overcrowded, unless they were damaged by the 7.5 on the Richter scale quake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris who suffered a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the army hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to the risk of severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed against the remains of a wall", Haris told an Associated Press correspondent, adding that he was in town with his family for a wedding.
"I heard my wife cry for help, and later I heard nothing.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a four-page ad in an American newspaper touting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump recently referred to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, an accusation denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US election marked a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to pressure China, according to US officials quoted by Reuters.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed increasingly higher import tariffs on each other.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were specifically aimed at hitting exporters in states like Iowa, which support Trump's Republican Party, as Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had hit American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is now doubling down on intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of free speech and a free press, a long-held tradition in America, by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, you will find in vain dissenting voices at a kiosk in central Beijing and will not see a true reflection of the diverse opinions that the Chinese people may have about the difficult economic trajectory, because the media is firmly under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers refused to publish its article", unless he said which newspaper it was from.
The Kavanaugh debacle alienated Republican female voters just before the midterm elections, analysts warn.
With many prominent Republicans rallying around Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, and defending him against various sexual assault allegations, analysts warn that this will set them up for a setback, especially among women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around this issue have been enormous and most Republicans have already indicated they want to proceed with the vote.
"These things can't be undone", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article that appeared Saturday.
Reeher said he wonders if Senator Jeff Flake's (Republican, Arizona) last-minute attempt to advocate for an FBI investigation will be enough to satisfy angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they are not going to forget tomorrow, and they are not going to forget in November", said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. news outlet on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" during their demonstration in the Senate chamber as Republicans who control the Justice Committee voted to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record high", Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high, and it's true.
But it can go even higher, especially among floating women voters in the suburbs and among younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who often do not vote even though they disagree with the president".
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her sexual harassment allegation against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested a setback could follow if Republicans pushed through the nomination.
"This has become a confusing mess for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party, told NBC News earlier last week.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or the final vote or Kavanaugh sitting on the court, but it's also about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told the news channel.
However, the American public is divided over who to believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority siding with the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony and that 35 percent definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was definitely or probably lying during his testimony while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's prosecution, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her while under the influence of alcohol when she was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals at a party when they were both at Yale in the '80s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to take on Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project from the tech legend, is a company that is based on the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the ability to choose where their data is stored and who can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that "world domination" is the guiding idea behind Inrupt.
"We need to do this now", he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own 'personal online data store' or POD.
It can store contact lists, activity lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is the fact that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company provides the resources, processes and skills needed to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that was bought by IBM, a few developers who were contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team will not hold talks with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation that completely turns all their business models upside down at once".
"We're not asking for their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide the commercial power and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new web, which is being built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even after the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: clergyman and recipient of the Victoria Cross from World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to have won a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a soldier is being honoured 100 years later in his birthplace.
Lieutenant-Colonel, the Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the medal for the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper, and so never knew that he had received Britain's highest military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather was honored.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918, "in a very thick fog and under heavy field and machine-gun fire".
He later stormed into the line of fire and led the line forward before running alone into a field gun and knocking out three members of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humbled".
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he was "very honoured to be able to play a part in the parade", adding that "the courage of a real hero is shown by the support he receives from a large number of people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine, you've been up all night watching a stalked Bellator 206 and you miss the most important moment.
The San Jose poster listed 13 fights, including six in the main section, and it was broadcast all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were unpleasantly surprised when the station switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were outraged because they had stayed up all night for this fight.
One fan described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"Government regulations prohibit showing content that is not suitable for children after 6:00 a.m., and therefore we had to switch to the children's program", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, "yes".
Scott Coker, the company president of Bellator, said they will be adjusting their programming to ensure that UK viewers have a chance in the future.
"I think, in view of the fight back, we can solve this problem", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and believe me, not all of them were as friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I can promise you this won't happen a second time.
We're limiting the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally do, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of his sexual orientation
Olympic show jumper Tom Daley says that during his youth he felt inferior because of his sexual orientation, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it was not until he entered secondary school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
In an interview with Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that parenting had contributed to his decreasing appreciation of winning at the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of the long-running show has taken a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a freak on Laverne's first program, Daley told that during his youth he felt "less" than others because it was "not socially accepted to like both girls and boys".
He said: "To this day, those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, are real facts that have given me the strength to be successful".
He wanted to prove that he was "something" so that people would not be disappointed if they eventually found out about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent campaigner for the LGBT community and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said that he spoke out because he felt happy to be able to live openly without further consequences and to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that the fact that he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "completely surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been an issue.
"When you have to go through so much at such a young age", he said, "he took part in his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find anyone in your own age group who has gone through the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "entire perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have said it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father hadn't accepted that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had already gotten the tickets to London 2012 because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't get it over my heart to say, 'You won't be there to sit in the front row, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until his breathing actually stopped and he died that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life, diving in front of a home crowd during the Olympics, there's no better feeling", he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musical choice, Proud by Heather Small, which had gripped him strongly on the way to the games and which still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is available to listen to on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he'll have to get back into shape before it becomes a sad milestone.
Mickelson, competing in the biennial event for the 12th time, a record, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors splits the day between supporting his teammates and practicing on the driving range, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.
Because he was never known for his straight drives even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the tight fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs routinely punishes stray balls.
And if the course itself isn't daunting enough, Mickelson will face the ever-accurate Francesco Molinari, British Open champion, in the ninth match on Sunday, who is tied with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the start of the 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk has shown confidence in this man, though frankly he could hardly have it any other way.
"He fully understood the role he had today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He's very confident in himself.
He's been inducted into the Hall of Fame and he's contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I expected more, but it is what it is, and it is the way we thought we should have acted.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson could beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he never quite matched the high points of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws to his name, but Furyk said his presence had a certain intangible impact on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to make jokes with people and he's a great guy to have on the team", he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed playing him occasionally last week, which was fun to watch.
He has so much more to offer than just his game".
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that a big lead can quickly vanish.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead before the singles matches on the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a less comfortable situation.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 race in Valderrama, where the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually crossed the finish line with the smallest possible margin: 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but just", Bjorn said, disconnected here, after watching the 2018 Lightning win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 lead over Le Golf National.
So history shows me and everyone else on the team that this is not a game that's been played.
Everyone will have to put in their full effort tomorrow.
Get to work and execute the plan properly.
It's not over until the dots are on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to win this trophy, and we need to stay focused on that.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we have, but we're also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world".
Enthusiastic about his players' performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never get ahead of myself in this area.
Tomorrow, we'll have another challenge.
Tomorrow we're gonna be talking about individual achievement, and that's another entirely different discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, your skills as a golfer are really tested.
That's the message you have to give the players, try to make the best of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and let him make the best of himself".
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than as partners.
Furyk himself has experience with both sides of this turnaround on the final day, as a member of the winning team in Brookline and as a loser when Europe realized the "Miracle of Medina".
"I remember every damn word of that speech", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had cheered his players up for the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but let's try to get off to a good start, like in Brookline, or like in Medina.
When we have the momentum, there's a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We've aligned our lineup to this and we're sending the guys out in the order that we think is best and, you know, we're going to try to do something out of the blue tomorrow".
Thomas is tasked with trying to lead the counter-offensive and puts Rory McIlroy in for the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the batting order.
"I chose this group in this order because I think we are so constantly covered", Bjorn said of his selection of singles players.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The German Navy's newest frigate was supposed to enter service in 2014, replacing the outdated warships of the Cold War era, but it will take at least another year to be ready, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the 'Rheinland-Pfalz', the lead ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a military spokesman.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but troubling problems after delivery have plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic characteristics.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two consecutive years, away from home ports.
The continuing delays, however, mean that the advanced warships, designed to enable Germany to project its power overseas, are already outdated by the time they are commissioned, notes Die Zeit.
The fateful frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind this return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would render the warship useless if deployed on a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the manpower on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship is severely overweight, which will reduce performance and limit the Navy's ability to carry out further upgrades.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as much as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, is also a problem.
It is said that this has reached a staggering €3.1 billion, compared to the original €2.2 billion.
The problems facing the newest frigates are made all the more serious by recent warnings that the power of the German navy is declining.
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the parliamentary defense committee in Germany, acknowledged that the navy actually has "a shortage of deployable ships".
The official said the problem has grown like a snowball over time, as old ships have been decommissioned but no replacement vessels have been delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were yet available for entry into the navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats.
New research being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and contribute to future conservation efforts.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, tracks the common and small dwarf bat, the brown giant bat and the water bat at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activity of the bats throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld fingerprint sensors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the bat's cries and which species is doing what.
A habitat map and a report are then produced to provide a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as creating grasslands and how best to maintain forests for bats and similar species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that affect their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning can also pose a risk, as can fly-traps and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echo-location technology to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, inspections of accommodation and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Landscape manager David Thompson says the estate is the ideal territory for the bats.
"Here in Threave, we have a great environment for bats", he said.
"We have the old buildings, many very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is still so much that is unknown about bats, and so the work we are doing here and in other locations will help us to better understand what they need to thrive".
He stresses the importance of bat control before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unintentional destruction of a nesting site could lead to the death of 400 female bats and their young, potentially wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scotland's official for the Bat Conservation Trust, has asked the public to contribute to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and of many of our species, we simply don't know what's going on with their populations".
Ronaldo rejects assault charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the sexual assault allegations "fake news" and said people "want to promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portugal and Juventus striker is accused of assaulting an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is also accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a video posted to his 142 million Instagram Live followers, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news" just hours after the allegations were reported.
"No, no, no, no, no, no. I was just...
What they say today, fake news", says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling me by my name.
It's normal. I know.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man, and through and through good", the footballer added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit to sue Der Spiegel for what they called "unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns", according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the "moral damage in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the complaint filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that he was a "good guy" for "99 percent", but that he is sometimes left behind by "one percent".
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that it was with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs were taken of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of the consequences" and because she was worried about the "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old now says she wants the arrangement annulled because she is permanently traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged assault and has left for Italian giants Juventus this summer in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret it forever' if carmakers leave
The UK will 'regret it forever' if it loses its status as the world leader in car production after Brexit, said Economic Affairs Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal", Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, where Toyota's Auris and Avensis are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production at our factory come to a halt", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about the impact of leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The most worrying concern for carmakers is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line operates on the 'just-in-time' principle, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars made to order.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be border unrest that industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota cannot stock up more than one day's supply at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore production would be halted in that case.
Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU was "exactly aligned to avoid those border checks".
"We need to have a deal.We want to have the best deal, which will not only allow us to continue the current success but also to seize this opportunity", he told listeners of BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely must be able to continue with this very successful set of supply chains".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the longer term that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a 24-year Burnaston employee and representative of the Unite union at the plant, said that his members are growing increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are lost, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, says White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed for another week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian influence in the election, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence has been running in the Washington gossip machine for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and to impeach the president via the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, rumors were circulating that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then moved the meeting to avoid a conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both scheduled to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the vote in the full Senate once again.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, Trump's press secretary, appeared on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set yet, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed another week, given all the other things going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press informed".
Some reporters had trouble with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not caused by a dislike of the "attention-grabbing" TV journalists, though, she added, "I won't deny they're trying to get attention".
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more Q&A sessions than any president before him", she said, without providing any evidence: "We looked at the numbers".
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States questions directly, that's infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and that will take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a candid and at times bizarre appearance to the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes letter on Brexit to NHS Scotland workers from other EU countries
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff working at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and wishes for them to continue working at the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applying for permanent status for EU citizens working for the devolved public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU continued, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
But at the same time the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know these must be uncertain times for all of you.
I therefore want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond, bring in valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the NHS and that deliver benefits to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery yesterday after sustaining a head injury in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of the Tennessean.
Rod Reed, Tennessee State's head coach, told reporters the accident happened shortly before recess.
"He came to the sideline and kind of collapsed there", Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff immediately gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him away for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are known about the type/size of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He was tackled a total of five times on Saturday before leaving the field, making him a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a house in the UK and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless under new plans by the Conservatives
This action will have to neutralize Corbyn's success to attract young voters.
The increase in levy is levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects this to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher levies when buying a home in the UK and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn who is attracting young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and pass it on to high earners.
The levy increase is levied on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra proceeds being spent in a government effort to combat homelessness.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current levy, including the higher rates introduced two years ago for second homes and homes bought for rent, could be as high as 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of new homes in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for newcomers to get a foot on the housing ladder.
Many affluent areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'ghost towns' because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the levy to help young people buy their first home.
He accused big construction firms of keeping prices high by buying up land and not using it and he called on May to abolish quotas on affordable housing to repair Britain's 'housing scandal'.
Corbyn has announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rent caps and an end to evictions "without negligence".
He also wants to give local governments more opportunities to build new homes.
May said: "Last year I said I wanted to devote my time as Prime Minister to restoring the 'British Dream', that life would be better for each new generation.
And that means we have to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy here as it is for hardworking British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become too vague, and the humiliation of living without a roof over your head is already too real".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, says it is his "ultimate ambition" to one day manage Scotland.
The Scot, 42, is enjoying the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east of England, who are currently third in League One, three points off first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light last summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a footballer, I always wanted to play for my country.
But I was selected for the B team and that was the end of it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"When I was a child, my father and I often watched Scotland play at Hampden Park and it's something that still attracts me.
However, that opportunity would come only if I was successful in managing a club".
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he was not intimidated to become the successor to these established names at a big club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me right now is measured by 'can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it should undoubtedly be in the Premier League", he says.
"It is not an easy task to achieve this, but I can only consider myself successful if I can get the club back there".
Ross has only been in his managerial career for three years, after a spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts coaching group.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the Third Division and transformed St Mirren from being on the verge of relegation to winning the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his football career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads", he recalled from the moment he took over at Alloa.
"I really believed management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I did pretty well, I made pretty good money, and I had some pretty good highs.
But football can be tough.
There are a lot of things you face every week.
I still do, given the stress and the pressure of the job, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now that I'm really one, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I've ever felt in my adult life".
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave has boosted revenues for British pubs struggling to survive, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues were down 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and the fact that England was in the world championships longer than expected meant that July showed a similar pattern to June, when pubs had a 2.8 percent increase in sales, with the difference that restaurants were now hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June only got worse in July.
Pubs and bars focused on liquor sales performed by far the best, with better like-for-like growth than restaurants declined.
Pubs that are also focused on selling food also take advantage of the sun, but not as dramatically as the restaurants.
It looks like people were just going out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, beverage sales were up 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales were down 3 percent".
Paul Newman of RSM, analysts for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in turnover in the entertainment market.
It is no surprise, then, that restaurant groups continue to struggle, even though a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales is especially painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators and only time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures of August will provide the much-needed respite".
The overall turnover growth in the pub and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the revenue monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyses the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion.

One in five children, some as young as 11, create social media accounts that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth in "fake Insta accounts", a reference to Instagram, the photo-sharing site.
This news has fueled fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean "main" account that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter's secret site discovered a teenager asking others to "rape" her.
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles and half admitted to keeping personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they can't be found by their parents and teachers".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the 'voice of the athlete' at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for the sport's governing bodies to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys a high level of respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit immensely from her election to the council", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be able to serve as the voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help to govern the sport in Scotland".
The American who won the 200-meter and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games, two of his four Olympic gold medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He tweeted: "Today a month ago I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover and to what extent.
It's been a hell of a lot of hard work, but I'm fully recovered now, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing my flexibility exercises again today!
Thank you for all the expressions of support!"
Breast pump ad comparing mothers to cows splits online
A company that makes breast pumps has stirred up online opinion with an ad comparing nursing mothers to milking cows.
To mark the introduction of what has been called "the world's quietest portable breast pump", consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released an ironic music-video-inspired ad to illustrate the freedom this new pump offers to fumbling mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything", and, "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't onions, these are my breasts".
The chorus then goes on to say, "Pump, pump, pump, I feed the babies, pump, pump, pump, I milk the ladies".
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, immediately sparked an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has generated hundreds of comments, mostly mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it condones the dairy industry's "horror".
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but in their case the babies are taken away within days of delivery", a response reads.
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: "This is obviously traumatic for mother and baby.
But yeah, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality".
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "hilarious".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
That pumpkin made me feel like a cow.
The ad's a little weird, but I didn't do too much digging behind it.
This is a brilliant product", wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad, aimed at moms who pump (often at work or in a toilet) and then feel like 'cows.'
This advert is not positive or negative at all about the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, you see the group of women all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who poke feel like cows sometimes.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into a feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go out while they are on the plunger.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother, says: "The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a tough and provocative introduction.
By comparing the mother pumping and the dairy cow, we wanted to put the pumping and the challenges involved in the spotlight, while also showing in an entertaining and understandable way how the new pump will create an incredible sense of freedom.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway of Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration make it harder to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid of jeopardizing their own chances of staying in the country by applying for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have signed up as sponsors of unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or family members of the sponsors are in this country illegally and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
We are prosecuting these individuals", Mr Albence said.
In an effort to process the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the start of detention, instead of the previously standard 60 days, according to shelter staff.
Many of them will appear in court via videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their claim for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed ineligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to the shelter's staff and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said these concerns are stronger in a larger facility, like Tornillo, where signs of a child struggling are often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem also called for the Syrian refugees to return, even as the war in the country enters its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be handled accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions", he told the Assembly.
According to Moualem, the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted and displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish troops and Syrian Arabs fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the refugees, Moualem said conditions were favourable for their return and he condemned "some Western countries for spreading irrational fears" that kept most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They're politicizing a cause that should be a purely humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be available to Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has opened the door for political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has averted a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province, home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that this agreement has "clear deadlines" and said he hoped that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be wiped out".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for Syria after the war and pave the way for elections.
Moualem made clear the conditions for the Syrian government to participate in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and he warned against outside interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many "liberal" viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is ended prematurely by impeachment proceedings and scandals.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic finale to a presidency ever".
At this time, however, there are no signs of visual fatigue.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership at CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings for cable with 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that attracts people because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, the creator of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", a series about a secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", has a different theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the storylines that come out of Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can be reunited or affect the status of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being a well-informed citizen when you realize that you've been sitting for six hours watching a panel of experts discussing the use of deep background sources by Bob Woodward in his book Fear, discussing Paul Manafort's $15,000 peacock leather jacket (a garment full of arrogance according to The Washington Post) and discussing the implications of Stormy Daniels' colorful description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
I'll never be able to watch Super Mario the same way again.
"What he does to give you the impression that it's a reality show is partly that he puts something new in every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, of the Trump show's rotating cast and daily plot changes (fighting the NFL, waving Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss an episode or you'll feel like you're falling behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees outside his home on the North Shore of Kauai, but he was inside watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
He couldn't get away from the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh being brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember we were doing all these weird shows not so long ago, and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right".

Money from outside is flowing in the most exciting midterm election for the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th district is seeing an influx of money, thanks to a redistricting that puts two sitting House representatives in contention for the same seat.
The recently redistricted Pittsburgh district meets Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is facing another sitting representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were reclassified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had been unconstitutionally reclassified ("gerrymandering") in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th District has led to a campaign finance feud between the financial arms of the two major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a well-watched special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
This seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump had won this district by a 20 percentage point margin.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a slight advantage.
The US considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China and has waived it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a cordial meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owned a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, because the country received $140 million in US aid in 2017, for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high murder rates.
While the internal meetings were going on, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference to focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from leaving for the United States.
But in mid-September, some top government officials let it be known that they wanted the conference to go ahead, making any possible punitive measures against El Salvador impossible in advance.
The plan now is for Vice President Mike Pence to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys have returned without further ado to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without harsh messages about punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate as described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were corroborated by an outside analyst who is also close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice, for which weighty evidence has now been made public.
Mueller will also likely focus his investigation on conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in an attack by Russia on our election.
If Congress changes its color, Trump will have to answer to that institution, just as he prepares to address the electorate again, and maybe he will have to answer to a jury in a court of law.
That's a lot of myths, and I don't want to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable, or that of his European counterparts.
There will be choices to be made by all of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and had supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and missed an opportunity to prevent the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of inflection, and the inexorable advance of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are currently facing several of these kinds of bending points.
What are we gonna do when Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this magazine reported that, last year, he had suggested recording conversations with the president in secret and that he had speculated about the president's suitability for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is false.
"How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy faces a very long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me away, 60 years later, to light candles for the Sabbath on that table with a swastika on it.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Wien
Rangers will be visiting Rapid Wien on Thursday and know that a win over the Austrians, following their impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury kept midfielder Graham Dorrans out of his first game of the season until the 2-2 draw at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a stepping stone to better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal have a really good squad", said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the race with the idea that there was something to win and we finished with a point.
Maybe we could have even won at the end, but looking at the whole game, a draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the better team.
Next Thursday is another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in their last game too but if the crowd is behind us, I'm sure we can push on and we can get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there's a feel-good factor hanging over the club.
The team is good and the guys are really enjoying it.
Hopefully, we can push through, put the past season behind us and be successful again".
Women can't sleep for fear of their retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few people discuss this with their relatives.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
And only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the steps necessary to have this conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
This is where we're gonna start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not communicate your wishes in a timely manner.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also give you advice on how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care, among other things, could be a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenses, or using equity as insurance, as long as you have money.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles when using insurance.
Get a health care proxy so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and to make sure that the professionals adhere to your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and to make sure that the bills are paid when you can no longer do so yourself.
Remember the small details: Suppose your aged parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
If so, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you have the information at hand.
"It's not just the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes through".
Man shot multiple times with a shotgun in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a shotgun as he was walking home from a night out.
The victim, 40 plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With the communications switched off, officials have yet to receive any information from Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Celebes Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km along the coast of northwest Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just below a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic activities in Central Celebes Province, especially in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but most of them are located in Morowali, on the opposite coast from Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been regularly hit by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami claimed over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes occurred on the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale hits the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit Pidie Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people were reminded of the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Multiple earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily stranded thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate, has been arrested on domestic violence charges.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged offences, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in Mat-Su detention center on $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "innocent, for sure" when asked, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He's also charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, then called the police to report the alleged assault.
This case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic abuse, interfering with a domestic violence report and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a veteran group in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD, which he allegedly inherited from his time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut while the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just outside the center of Celebes, which is northeast of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are demanding a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, was charged with using a Home Depot truck to carry out a hit-and-run on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and cyclists who came in his path in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the plea in law seeking the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry the death penalty, according to the court filing.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the indictment on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for racketeering purposes, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organized crime, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and preparation", according to prosecutors, who described Sajpov's manner of carrying out the attack as "horrific, cruel and depraved".
"Sajfoello Habiboellayevich Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the letter of intent reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is over ten years since a case in the Southern District of New York called for the death penalty.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Sajpov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He let the detectives know he felt good about what he did, even the police.
Sajpov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said he was "naturally disappointed" with the prosecutors' decision.
"We think the decision to demand the death penalty rather than accept a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of parole will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved", Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to mobilise a "popular army" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the "heat" of Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he take the lead in negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told marchers in Birmingham that the UK would "already be out" if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge May faces in reconciling the deeply divided ranks is underscored by two pro-Remain Conservatives who are attending a separate Brexit protest rally in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers compromise going while it comes under attack from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Co-sponsors insisted that she would go ahead and try to strike a deal with Brussels despite the setbacks, thus forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wants to "throw Chequers in the trash".
He proposed that Farage be knighted and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he quit the service, we'd be out of here by now", Bone said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to throw Chequers in the trash".
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight two world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false".
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not voting, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go door to door and make sure we get elected.
Drop the chequers and listen".
In a message addressed to May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage told the gathering that politicians need to "feel the heat" if they want to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we're not gonna let you get away with this.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to light the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that won us the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we are once again an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this march with a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved Tories Against Brexit flags after the group's creation over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour member of the House of Lords, joked about the security problems of a Conservative party app at the start of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us they can provide IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for the frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete and utter farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit", he added.
Warren plans to "get serious" about running for president.
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "well consider her candidacy for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a Republican congressman who co-chaired Trum's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation that she might be in the running for Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at a town hall since Trump came to power.
A person present asked her if she would run for president.
Warren responded that it was time "for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrested in the shooting of LSU's Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge, Louisiana police said Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, during an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died from his injuries", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has admitted to being at the scene, possessing a firearm and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and is being held in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-3 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games and started 10 last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory on team orders
When Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play a role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from pole position and left Hamilton almost completely in the cold as he defended his position and Vettel invited his teammate to attack.
Vettel went into the pits and let Hamilton drive in the crowded tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes entered the pits a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in the lead after a wheel-on-wheel action that reluctantly forced the Ferrari driver to clear space inside after a double move in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from last place and finished seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a while, because he stuck to his tyre choice and aimed for a fast finish so he could overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually went to the pits on lap 44, after he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman and he let me pass.
The team did their best for first and second place", said Hamilton.
That wasn't good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a campaign rally on Saturday over her insistence that she was not the source of Christine Blasey Ford's leaked letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a campaign rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead made it clear that what took place in the Senate showed that people can be 'mean, unkind and untruthful.'"
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful display that's been taking place in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you're the people who are angry and mean and mean and unkind and untrue", he said.
"When you look at the press releases and the leaks and they go, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I'm not going to.
I didn't leak".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... no, we didn't leak", he added, imitating the senator.
In July, the letter that mentioned the allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein by Ford and leaked in September, but Feinstein has denied that her desk was the leak.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to handle it confidentially and I treated it confidentially, as she had requested".
But the president didn't seem to believe her denial, and he commented on it during the Saturday night meeting: "I'll tell you what, that wasn't good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who is accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the accusations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back power, by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the rudeness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive to take power and take back control", the president was quoted as saying by a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars against the Belfast Giants , 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars have made up for Friday's Elite League loss to Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had two-goal lead by scores from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home team to the side before Dwyer took the Giants back into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
It was the third Elite League loss this season for Adam Keefe's men, who had to make up a late deficit on Friday night to then beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came at 3:35 in the fourth minute on an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford's assist doubled Beauvillier's lead four minutes later.
In a busy opening period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 1:10 p.m., before Matt Marquardt took the lead for Cownie's tiebreaker at 3:15 p.m.
Dwyer gave the Giants a lead going into the first half when he scored his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team recovered and Bouchard brought them back to a tie with a power-play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he scored the winning goal with the fifth goal for his team midway through the final period.
The Giants, now down four of their last five games, play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while making sure hundreds can escape the earthquake in a plane
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after he died for helping a plane with hundreds of people on board take off safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks are still afflicting the area and many are buried beneath the point in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly moving traffic tower of Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at that time ready on the runway, could take off safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic tower when he thought it was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported from Australia.
We had arranged for a helicopter to fly him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart to hear that", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands and have informed the country's disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is restricted.
"The death toll is believed to be still rising because many bodies were under the rubble and have not yet been reached", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to 20 feet high have devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Bodies are being brought in by ambulances every minute.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse".
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military there: "I call on all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks necessary for the evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says one man is missing after a plane crash in Micronesia
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one more man is missing after earlier reporting that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely exited the sunken plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger was missing Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and detectives to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane went down in the water while landing at the Chuuke Islands airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday and that the condition of all was stable.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon and missed the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane was shot down over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and a few others managed to wade the waist-deep water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy announced that sailors working nearby at a shipyard also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to bring people to shore before the plane sank further into the water about 100 feet [30 m] deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have died in crashes involving airlines registered with PNG over the past 20 years, but none of these involve Air Niugini.
Analyst traces the timeline of the night a woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors closed their arraignment Friday in the re-trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, gave a few hours of expert testimony on information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used the Belgian cell phone records to record the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night she took her own life.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, which contradicted his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford again.
Sanford was on the stand on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told Sanford that he was in his truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told Chambers that he knew her for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone records indicated they'd only known each other a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis erased the texts, calls and contact information from Chambers' phone some time after Chambers died.
"He wiped her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to be able to begin deliberations later that day.
The High Breed: What is "conscious hip hop"?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol argue that hip-hop is alienated from its origins with political opinions and the emphasis on social problems.
They want to go back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a resurgence in Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York nanny sues a couple over a "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly transmitted text message complaining about "another black guy".
The couple denies being racist and calls the lawsuit "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her horror when she discovered that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, turned out to be a Negro woman when she met her on her first day at work in 2016.
"Never be so black again", Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice no fewer than twice.
According to the New York Post, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice when she realized her mistake, stating that their previous African-American nanny had done a poor job and that she was expecting a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for $350 a day for the six months she was hired to live with the family internally, even though she had no contract.
"I want them to feel that you just don't do something like this", Maurice wrote in the New York Post last Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple dismissed the claim that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to fire Maurice after they feared that by insulting her they could no longer trust her.
"My wife texted her that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,' husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
"But would you leave your children with someone who had offended you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Stop it".
On comparing the trial to 'extortion', Plasco said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
"You're gonna sue someone like that?
That's not very nice,' the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion is quick to capitulate to the couple on social media, where they are being taunted for their behavior and reasoning.
The publishers of Paddington feared the public would not be interested in a talking bear, newly discovered letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even before the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it's very entertaining".
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about a small teddy bear, was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication felt "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "a very distinguished member of the family", she said that her father was secretly proud of the eventual success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man".
'But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost seemed like a child's achievement; you're proud when you've done nothing for it yourself.
I think he was kind of experiencing the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own imagination, he credited the bear himself for the success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Immediately after landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
'Nad had called several times to say that it looked very bad and that she was not expected to make it,' said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together again soon.
I'll be back with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly ran out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this trial ruled it all out.
I could only sit there, knowing what was happening.
I couldn't whine, scream or cry because I was surrounded by all kinds of people and families.
I had to be really big".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears kept coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt an overwhelming sense of compassion for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women post messages on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are coming together to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspiring messages and phone numbers for people in need to call for help on a bridge in Wales
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and he committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, Gloucestershire, England, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
"He was known for his smile.
It was always said that his smile lit up every room".
Yet he stopped working before his death because he was deep in the pit.'
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found him after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: "I am constantly worried about a chain reaction".
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are others you can go to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Do not keep silent - speak about it.'
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling gloomy or depressed or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was all over the floor on Christmas Day - when the kids were unwrapping their presents, he didn't even look at them or anything.'
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to deal with it: 'It tears the whole family apart.
It's driving us apart.
But we all have to keep going and keep fighting.'

Brett Kavanaugh's future uncertain as the FBI investigates
'I thought that if we could actually get what he is asking for, a limited in time and scope investigation, then maybe we could create some unity again,' Mr Flake said last Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was falling apart amid a deeply entrenched stalemate within the party.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance has everything to do with timing.
The midterm elections are in five weeks, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their efforts to get their man elected to the highest court in the land will be seriously hampered.
George W. Bush has already called members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and thus met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI gets the report?
Then there's a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can count on at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the deciding vote to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's defectors 'down' under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has dropped since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park notes that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher penalties for smugglers are the main factors in the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly expels them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still formally at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they discussed the stagnation of negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting followed the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they broadly agreed to work towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of the lack of progress in lifting U.S. sanctions since then.
"Without faith in the actions of the United States, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament", Mr Ri said in an address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and finds him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and found him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved like this, they would call her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, almost screaming at times and especially upset when he told about his family and high school days.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and coordinated character assassination" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that she felt Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with his statements and the way he speaks about the Clintons and the Democrats", Pelosi said.
Pelosi protested when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he were appointed, and the Democrats would have a majority in the House.
"I can say this about that; if he doesn't tell the truth in Congress, or to the FBI, then he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but the court he serves on now", Pelosi declared.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District of Columbia (often abbreviated D.C.) District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would speak out against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade, as Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
Kavanaugh bypassed questions about revising certain Supreme Court decisions during confirmation hearings.
"Don't expect us to cheer when a hysterical, prejudiced person is appointed to the Supreme Court", Pelosi said.
Women just have to admit it.
It's a righteous tirade of months and years of pent-up anger that overflows, and she can only cry to get it out.
"We'll cry when we get angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's weird, do you?"
She continued, "I was helped tremendously by a woman who was a manager somewhere, and she told me that she would cry when she got angry, and she developed a method where she would cry whenever she got angry, and she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I cry.
I'm pissed off".
And then she just kept crying.
I just thought it was brilliant".
Tears are partly permissible as an expression of anger, because crying is essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories from my previous job, in a male-dominated office, is when I was crying like a baby because I was so angry, and an older woman, a cold, unassuming executive who everybody was a little bit afraid of, grabbed me by the scalp and dragged me down a flight of stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you on the wardrobe.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked for Gary Hart on his presidential bid.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on board a boat called the Monkey Business (informally meaning "cat-crazy" or "monkey-trap") and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, deeply disappointed, felt that there was no reason why she should not run.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she told me 30 years later, smiling.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because the campaign was already well advanced, she was behind with fundraising, so she solemnly promised not to participate unless she could raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who would give men $1,000, only wanted to give her $250.
'Do they think I'm getting a discount?' she wondered.
When she gave her speech announcing that she would not formally start a campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings -- of gratitude to the people who had supported her, of frustration that the system made it so difficult to raise money, and reach voters instead of delegates, and of anger about sexism -- that she choked.
"People must have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the media reaction to her.
"They must have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my tombstone?
"She was crying?"
How the US-China trade war could turn out to be a win-win for Beijing
The opening salvoes of the US-China trade war were deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say a rift between the two countries could be a long-term boon for Beijing.
Donald Trump, the US president, issued the first warning earlier this year by raising tariffs on key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week when new effective, increased tariffs were unveiled on $200 billion (150 billion euros) of goods; half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in kind each time, most recently by raising tariffs from 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China has vowed to catch up with the US every time, and the world's second largest economy is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
To make Washington bow, requests must be granted, but publicly bowing to the United States is far too painful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays smart, the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long run, as the two economies' mutual dependence decreases.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that could lead either country into an economic free fall is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged", says Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank specializing in national security issues that focuses on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to allow refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that conditions in his country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists and to normalize the situation on the ground.
All the conditions are now in place for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
It is estimated that there are still some six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or aid from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National golf course southwest of Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the necessary 14.5 points to beat the United States.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who had been struggling for most of the tournament, dropped his long shot from the tee into the water at par 3, hole 16, conceding his loss to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was sent off by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes to play.
The highest-ranked player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost two holes down and one hole to play to Ian Poulter of Great Britain, who may be playing his final Ryder Cup match.
Spain's Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all time in all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
"I don't cry very often, but today I can't help it.
It's been a rough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot, John Ram, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods by two holes down and one hole to go into Sunday's singles match.
"The enormous pride I feel in beating Tiger Woods, I've followed that guy all my life growing up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic from one of the greatest players of all time, winner of 14 major championships, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the fairways over the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In a short time this morning, we made Europe a little more difficult.
We were resisting.
With all due respect to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players on his team played very well.
I'm gonna work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're gonna look forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to take your hat off to your opponent.
We've been cheated on".
Red glow update: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties.
The most recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission shows a general decline in red glow concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay Area (located on the west coast of Florida in the United States).
According to the committee, there are reports of fragmentary increases in Red Glow in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, which could indicate a decline in concentrations.
The Red Glow extends an average of 200 kilometers of coastline, from Pinellas County in the north to Lee County in the south.
There are about 10 miles of coastline in Hillsborough County, but less spots than last week.
There's also been a report of red glow in Pasco County.
There have been medium concentrations reported off the coast of Pinellas County over the past week, low to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations off or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations off or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are ongoing reports of respiratory irritation in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier counties.
