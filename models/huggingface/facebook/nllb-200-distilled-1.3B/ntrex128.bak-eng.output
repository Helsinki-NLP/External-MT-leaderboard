Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned about the similarity of Mappett to dolls
Some feared changing the name of the assembly to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament) .
This controversy arose over plans to rename the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
The members of the AM, or assembly, think that we can be ridiculed by all political spectators.
One AM laborist reported that his team was concerned about the rhyming with Twp and Pwp".
For out-of-country readers of Welsh news: twp translates from Welsh as deaf, pwp means buck.
National Welsh and social-democratic political parties generally do not propose alternative options.
Although the Conservative Party of Wales was open to the name change, the move from the MWP to the Muppets was quick.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is read similarly to the English letter u for Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on a bill to amend the name, announced: "The decision on how to name the members of the Assembly, of course, remains with the members themselves".
Under the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Assembly of Wales has the right to change its name.
When the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals in June, it was understood that they preferred to call the assembly the Parliament of Wales.
As for the name, the Commission favored members of the Welsh parliaments, i.e. WMP, but the MWP variant received the most votes during the public consultation.
The Assembly members, as they see it, proposed alternative options, but reaching an agreement on this debate could present difficulties for Chairman Elin Jones, who is expected to present the amended bill within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms includes the methods of operation of the assembly, as well as rules for disqualifying members of the assembly and structures of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly, after a discussion of legislation, will hold a final vote on how they should be named.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their state
On Sunday, voters will be able to vote for or against the change of name of their state to Republic of North Macedonia.
This referendum was due to a long-running dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province, Macedonia.
The Athenian leadership, however, believed that their northern neighbors could claim their lands because of the state's name, and opposed their accession to the EU and NATO.
President George Ivanov of Macedonia, who opposed the change of the name of the state in a public poll, said he was cold to the vote.
In any case, the supporters of the referendum, as well as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that changing the name of the state is simply the price of accession to the EU and NATO and that it is the only price that can be paid.
The bells of St. Martin's Church were silenced, as were those of the churches in Harlem.
"All the older people I spoke to, there were historic bars and churches around every corner", said Mr. Adam.
There is nothing here today.
He said that the disappearance of the Barbarians was understandable.
Nowadays, people communicate in many different ways, he says.
The bars are not the neighboring hotels that other people regularly visit.
As for the churches, as expected, the leaders were concerned that the money they had bought from the assets would not last long, and that sooner or later they would return to where they started.
He added that by making numerous houses out of churches, condominiums could be filled with people who were indifferent to other churches or places of worship.
Most of the people who will get condominiums in these buildings will be white,  he says, and therefore will be waiting for these churches to be closed down altogether, as it is suspected that people who move into these condominiums attend such churches.
Both churches were built by a union of whites, before Harlem became a black community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The first white Methodist community left in the 1930s.
The community of black people had been praying nearby, and they obtained ownership of the building.
The church was occupied by a black community led by John Howard Johnson, also known for his anti-black employment stance in Harlem, leading a boycott of 125th Street, the main shopping street.
The 1939 fire caused severe damage to the building, but when Johnson's successors already had plans to rebuild the building, they ordered a carillon.
The carillon of St. Martin's Church was proudly called the Bells of the Clare by Lord David Johnson, son and heir of John Johnson.
However, in July, a specialist who played the corillon gave it another name: Cultural Treasure and Incomparable Historical Weapon.
The expert from the University of Michigan, Tiffany Eun, also noted that the first black musician to play the carillon in the world was Dionizio A. Lind, who moved into the large carillon at Riverside Church only 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriwezer said that the carillon in St. Martin's Church had not been replaced.
During the last few months, the Cathedral of St. Martin was in a difficult situation of architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by secular church leaders, and others by the Bishops' Diocese.
The organ that was responsible for the arrivals, the Riznica, consisted of the common people, and in July wrote a letter to the Diocese in fear that the Diocese would not try to put the expenses on the Riznice, because the architects and contractors sent by the Diocese were not hired by them.
Some churchgoers complained that the diocese lacked clear understanding.
A 13-year-old boy caught by lobsters in California was attacked by a shark
A lobster hunt began in California on Saturday, when a 13-year-old boy who was chasing them was attacked by a shark, officials said.
The attack occurred at 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, after he and his friends had been in the water for about half an hour, they heard a child screaming for help and they went to help the boy.
Hammel first thought the boy was excited to catch the lobsters, only to realize that the boy was screaming They bit me!.
I was bitten!
As soon as he reached the boy, Hammel saw that his arm was broken.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!"  added Hammel.
The boy was taken by plane to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles of the rescue team saw a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but he told a briefing for the media that the shark was a safe species.
Giles noted that the victim had sustained injuries to the upper body.
Officials have closed the beaches from Ponto-beach in Kassablad to Swami-beach in Echinitas for 48 hours for safety and investigative work.
The area is home to more than 135 species of sharks, but most of them pose no threat to humans, added Giles.
Sainsbury's plans to conquer the British beauty market
Sainsbury's acquired department stores in the style of a department store with assistant specialists in the shops Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
The British beauty market has grown rapidly to £2.8 billion, and it continues to grow, while the cost of fashion and household goods is falling, so it is important to establish larger beauty salons in 11 stores across the country, and if all goes well, to continue with more stores for the next year.
The investment in beauty comes in terms of the use of shelf space in supermarkets, where previously TVs, microwaves and household items were located.
Sainsbury's said they will expand their beauty cosmetics offerings to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw brands.
The already existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees lines will also be expanded, taking the place of a special section, as in the Boots store.
The supermarket also updated its range of boutique cosmetics, most of which consist of vegan cosmetics, as there is a demand for this type of cosmetics among young people.
In addition, the perfume retailer will test the discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in the Croydon area of south London, and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
With the shift from online stores and local ones to daily purchases of food, supermarkets have to do more to keep people interested.
Sainsbury's executive director Mike Coupe said retailers will become more like department stores as supermarkets try to counter the numerous offers and discount stores of Aldi and Lidl, which sell non-food items.
Sainsbury's has established a sales point on Argos, as well as a good location two years ago, which, he says, has increased sales revenue.
The supermarket's previous attempt to renovate the beauty and pharmacy departments was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's and Boots had tried to run a business together in the early 2000s, but the relationship broke down because they could not share the proceeds from the sale.
The new strategy came three years after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store Celesio pharmacy business to the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy chain for £125 million.
It said the Lloyds chain would add luxury brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to its four-storey expanded range.
Paul Mills Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look of our beauty salons to make our customers feel good.
We also invested in staff who could give specific advice.
Our brand range is designed with all the needs of the buyer in mind, and the attractive appearance and convenient location, now we have become the ideal beauty spot, which defies the old sales laws.
After Holly Willaubie left the £11 million deal, Peter Jones was "very angry"
After the departure of Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, and presenter Holly Willowbie, who left the £11 million lifestyle brand business "in a fit of rage", Willowbie signed new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willlowby has no time for the housewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
Today, the 37-year-old morning television host announced on Instagram that she was leaving the project.
Holly Willowbie, who was with Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, left the lifestyle brand business at the last minute to work on her new contracts with M&S and ITV.
Sources said that Jones was furious when, during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the Marlow, Buckinghamshire business-imperial headquarters, Willowby told him he was quitting the business because he had no time left for his new £1.5 million contracts for the brand Truly.
The business, similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, could have doubled Willowby's £11 million valuation.
After announcing her departure from Truly on Instagram, 37-year-old Willlowby left Britain and moved to one of her holiday homes.
According to the source: "However, Truly  was one of Holly's top priorities.
This was his chance to live easily for the next few decades, in view of his long-term future.
The decision to leave was a shock to everyone.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, as the project was about to begin.
Marlow's headquarters has a warehouse full of ready-to-sell goods.
Experts believe that the exit of the star of Britain's most profitable show, Today Morning, would mean a loss of millions of dollars for the firm, as investments in everything from pillows to clothing have been made for a long time and could be delayed in the future.
And this may mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
A mother of three, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
He co-founded Truly with Willoughby Kapp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
Families stayed together, and Jones Baldwin owned 40% of the television firm.
Willlowby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace former ITV presenter, Ent McPartin, who is currently the host of "I'm A Celebrity".
A source close to Jones said last night: "We don't comment on his working relationship".
It was hard to talk, and then we fell in love.
Some would consider the comment "unfitting for the president", and Trump joked that he would be criticized by the media for his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so easily?
Trump laughed with a voice of newscaster.
I never gave up.
Kim agreed to a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization.
However, the talks on denuclearization have not yielded any results.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong-ho noted on Saturday that the United States had not seen a "reasonable response" to the first steps taken by North Korea to denuclearize.
Instead, he says, the U.S. continues to exert pressure through sanctions.
Trump was particularly optimistic in his speech at the rally.
We have a good relationship with North Korea  he says.
We were thinking of going to war with North Korea.
Millions would die.
And now we have good relations.
According to him, the efforts to improve relations with Kim have also had positive results: the rocket tests have been stopped, the hostages have been released and the remains of American soldiers have been repatriated.
And he kept his strange attitude in his communication about Kim.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people outside in this little arena, we have about 200 people standing right here", Trump says, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
An earthquake and tsunami devastated the Indonesian islands, killing hundreds
For example, after the earthquake in Lomboka, foreign NGOs were told that they were no longer needed.
Despite the evacuation of more than 10 percent of the population in Lombok, the national disaster status was not declared, which was a necessary condition for the activation of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they made it very clear that they do not need international assistance, which is causing some difficulties", Ms. Sumbuung said.
At the same time, Save the Children assembled a team to go to Palau, but was not sure that foreign workers would be able to help.
The representative of the National Agency for Emergencies, Mr. Sutopo, said that the need for international organizations to help in the situation in Paalu in Indonesia is appreciated by the officials.
Given that Indonesia is a constant earthquake victim, they are unprepared for the natural tests.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Acheha, they are not common on coastal areas.
The absence of warning sirens in Palou, despite warnings of a tsunami, could be the cause of human deaths.
Even in good times, traveling through the many Indonesian islands was a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
The hospital ship sent to Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake was heading for Palu, but it took at least three days to reach the new tragedy site.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's ruined infrastructure a key element of his election campaign, and invested in road and railway works.
However, the lack of funding weakened Mr. Joko's administration, as elections were threatened the following year.
Mr. Joko also opposed the violent pressure in Indonesia, in terms of the conversion of many Muslims to a conservative form of religion.
When Muslim and Christian gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows and other crude weapons, over 1,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were driven from their homes.

Daniel Starrijs saved Liverpool from relegation to Chelsea by scoring a goal in the 89th minute of the Premier League game at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in London.
When his team was down 1-0 at about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, Starrij received a pass from Shakiri.
He plays the ball on his left side, then hits the most distant shelf.
The ball is thrown high into the top corner of the goal.
Thus, the ball passed through Kepu Arrizabalag and hit the goal.
"I tried to get in that position and score with the ball, because players like Shaq always give their best, so I tried to give myself more time", Starriдж told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanté approaching and hit the ball without thinking much on one touch.
After a goal by Belgian star Eden Azar in the 25th minute of the game, Chelsea took the lead with a score of 1:0.
The Sky striker gave a pass to Mato Kowačić on the ridge, and the latter turned in the middle of the field and ran towards Liverpool.
Kovačić made a quick pass to the center of the field.
He then made a beautiful pass and took Hazard off the bench.
Hazard was ahead of the defenders and scored a goal with a sloppy foot through "Liverpool"'s Allison Bekkers.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 CET at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
In London, on Thursday at 3 pm, Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832
The death toll from the tsunami and landslides in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state emergency agency said Sunday morning.
Various structures collapsed on Friday due to a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which also caused waves of up to 20 feet, and many people were trapped under the debris, a representative of the Sutopov Purvo Nuгроho Agency told a press conference.
The city of Palou, with a population of over 380 000, consists entirely of ruined buildings and structures.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man accused of killing a woman
The investigation began this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old man was found with a knife wound at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson-Muse building, John Street, with a 32-year-old man, and the 32-year-old suspect was immediately arrested.
Police officers are searching the area for people who have seen or heard anything.
Detective-inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would ask all those in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if you see or hear anything suspicious.
I also ask others, especially taxi drivers, to contact us, as their video recorders may contain video-records that are important for our investigation.
The woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhend, and was found inside the house, a police spokesman confirmed.
Friends who thought they knew the woman came to the scene today to ask where they had found her.
The investigation is ongoing, as police are still in the process of notifying the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver from Grayson-Meuse was just trying to get into his house, but police officers were not letting anyone in or out.
When he learned about this incident, he wrote it down.
The residents were informed that they would be able to return to their homes after a few hours.
A police officer was also heard to inform a person that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene of the crime crying.
He repeated Kot-a-Kos-.
At two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the oceplenium and another outside the oceplenium.
Several officers were standing inside the oception and patrolling the rear of the apartment building.
Those with information are asked to contact DM @MerPolCC, or by calling 101 or anonymously on the red line 0800 555 111 via the link to the 247 journal dated 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell became the last memorial hit of the attempt to rewrite history
It would be poetic to destroy this statue by his puritan followers, who would have destroyed most of the cultural and religious monuments of Taliban-colored England.
However, the Cromwellian Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion "ridiculous" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the destruction of statues, it is not surprising that the figure of Oliver Cromwell, who was not in the Palace of Westminster, was turned into a sculpture.
During the English Civil War, there was no order to destroy the icons, nor was it carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell was to be a victim of the mistakes of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The beautiful portrait of Cromwell, painted by Sir William Hammock Thornicroft, reflects the 19th century thought, and is part of the image of the historical figure that many still praise.
As Mr Goldsmith reported to The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell's personality was seen by many, more so at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of parliament, from outside pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
Whether this is an exact prediction is one of the ongoing historical debates.
The conflict of the mid-17th century undoubtedly marked the further development of our nation, and the person of Cromwell shows one side of this break.
His achievements as lord-protector are also to be praised and perpetuated.
Farmer killed by pig in China
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a southwestern market in China.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuán", was found dead in a swine's nest near the market town of Lupanyushue in Guizhou province, bleeding from a ruptured artery, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday morning.
In the Chinese province of Qinghai, a pig farmer prepares to sow a vaccine in pigs in pig farms on May 30, 2005.
He and his twin brother came to the market on Wednesday from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the brother found him dead, the door to the neighboring pigsty open.
According to his story, inside the palace stood a large male pig with a bloodstained mouth.
A court-medical examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer, the report said.
My cousin's legs were bleeding from injuries,  says Guiyang Evening News named his brother after his surname U.
CCTV footage shows Yuanyu entering the market at 4.40am on Thursday to feed the pigs.
About an hour later, her body was found.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuanyun or his cousin.
The market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up until police collected evidence at the scene to prevent it from attacking anyone else.
It was reported that Yuan's family was in talks with the market authorities about compensation for the death.
There have been rare, but historically significant, cases of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer into a tractor, scaring the animal away from his wife.
In 2012, after a farmer in Oregon was eaten by one of his pigs, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are usually aggressive but the taste of blood has a negative effect on them.
They just play like that.
They are very curious... they don't mean to hurt.
You must give them the respect they deserve".
Remaining parts of Hurricane Rose bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As expected, the cold waters of the Gulf of Mexico are reducing the force of Hurricane Rosa.
However, soon Rose will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rose reached winds of 85 mph, a category 1 hurricane 385 miles southwest of Punt-Evgenia, Mexico.
On Sunday, Rose is expected to head north.
Meanwhile, an air trough formed over the Pacific Ocean and moved eastward toward the west coast of the United States, reaching the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, when the tropical storm began to push deep tropical moisture northward into the southwest of the United States.
Monday, some parts of Mexico were forecast to receive up to 10 inches of rain.
Subsequently, tropical moisture will come into contact with the approaching jellybean, producing strong showers that are widespread in the southwest these days.
The rainfall from 1 to 4 inches will cause sudden and dangerous flooding, debris flows and possibly desert erosion.
Strong tropical humidity will bring rainfall to 2-3 inches per hour in some places, especially in southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona, rainfall is expected to be between 2 and 4 inches.
Since the area is prone to tropical rain, the conditions can deteriorate and sudden floods can occur.
During the tropical rains, walking in the desert is pointless.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into rivers, and lightning can cause sudden windstorms and dust up in places.
The approaching air trough will bring local heavy rain to the coast of Southern California.
Precipitation can be as low as half an inch in total, which will reduce debris flow and slippery roads.
During the rainy season, this will be the first rainfall in the region.
The partial tropical downpour will begin to approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, with the strongest rainfall expected late Monday and early Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to four directions on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, there was a sudden temperature change across the entire United States, as the Arctic began to cool, while the tropics remained warm.
Over time, even in small spaces, temperatures can change abruptly.
A good example of temperature change was Sunday in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as St. Louis and De-Moin, Iowa, can reach up to 20 degrees.
The next few days will be filled with long summer heat.
Most of the central and eastern parts of the United States will see the warmth expected in the early 80s, from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast.
Tuesday in New York, it could be 80 degrees, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast is for the first half of October to be high above average temperatures in the eastern half of the United States.
Brett Kavanaugh's broadcast was watched by 20 million more people
The case between Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Kristin Blejsi-Ford, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television channels on Thursday.
The regular program on Friday was interrupted at the last minute to show the continuation of the political standoff: Arizona Senator Jeff Flake had made a deal that the FBI would conduct investigations for a week.
At the school disco, while he was drunk, Kavano beat him and stripped him of his clothes, telling the Senate Judiciary Committee that he knew Ford 100 percent.
In his emotional response, Kavano said that he knew 100% that this was not the case.
According to Nielsen, the report was seen by more than 20.4 million people on Friday.
The company measures the average viewership of its channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Also, the numbers of PBS, C-SPAN, the Fox Business Network and other channels indicating this were not initially known.
And determining the number of viewers viewed from offices posed difficulties for Nielsen.
In perspective, the audience size is roughly equal to the number of viewers watching a football match play-off or the awarding of an Oscar.
Nielsen said that Fox News Channel, which reportedly had a positive response from its hosts, had a viewership of about 5.69 million during the day of the hearings.
ABC is in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million television viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Even after the hearings, the interest continued.
Flake became a central figure in the Friday drama.
After the Republican team published a message that it had voted for Kavano, it was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as they tried to climb the elevator to the Judicial Committee where the hearings were being held, while protesters shouted.
She stared at the floor for a few minutes before being spat on by CNN live.
A woman says, "I'm standing right in front of you".
Do you think he is telling the country the truth?
When you are strong, so many women say to you that you are weak.
Before the elevator was closed, Flake responded from his office and said he would have more to say before the next committee hearings.
Within hours, cable television and radio networks were broadcasting live when the Judicial Committee was due to vote in full Senate to remove Kavano's candidacy.
However, Flake said that the vote would be held only after the FBI had reviewed the charges against the candidate in the second week, a move supported by the Democratic Party, which was in the minority.
Flake was convinced by a conversation with his friend, Senator-Democrat Chris Koons.
After consulting with Kuns and a few other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was important because the Republican Party could not elect him without conducting an investigation into the Kavano case.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Kavano's accuser.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of playing "a political game" on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing a "political game" that undermines Britain's future and the nation's development, she wrote in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018 to attend the Conference of the Conservative Party.
In another front-page interview, former foreign minister Boris Johnson criticized his Chequers plan for Brexit, saying the proposal to create a common customs territory between Britain and the EU was "completely ridiculous".
Wade Simms shot: Police arrest Dayton Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police arrested a man suspected of shooting Wade Simms, a 20-year-old basketball player from the LSU.
According to the Baton Rouge police chief, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and was being held in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of Simms and Simpson fighting, and police officers said that Simms lost his sight there.
Police recovered the specimens from the crime scene, and found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting Wade.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the Coroner's Office of the East Baton Rouge County issued a preliminary report on the results, which stated that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department would like to thank the Louisiana State Fugitive Police Task Force, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police officers and the local community for helping to find the perpetrators.
Sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their "efforts and efforts for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, coach Will Wade of the LSU basketball team announced that the team was in shock over his death.
"It's always a worrying thing", says Wade.
Mexico City hit by volcanic ash
Ash from the Pocatepetl volcano reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
After an intensification of the crater's activity, which resulted in 183 gas and ash spills in 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday.
The center was struck by numerous sounds and vibrations.
Photos in social networks show a thin layer of dust on the windows of cars in the Hochimiлько district near Mexico City.
After a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in September 2017 in central Mexico, Geophysicists observed an increase in the volcano's activity 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
As the year of the independence vote approaches, police officers and Catalan separatists clash.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after a clash with a radical group protesting independence on Saturday, while thousands joined a demonstration dedicated to the first anniversary of Catalonia's secession.
The radical group, which was a member of the Omon, sprayed Omon with egg and powder paint, which raised black dust clouds on the crowded streets.
Later that day, clashes broke out after police officers used batons to hold the crowd.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "We will not forget, we will not forgive", while the opposing unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for some of the injuries they received during the protests, local press reported.
The atmosphere of tension in the region, which aims to achieve independence, remains high, especially after the referendum on October 1, a year later, was declared illegal by Madrid, but the Catalan separatists only celebrated it.
Most voters wanted independence, although the number of those who voted for independence was small, and those who supported secession largely boycotted the election.
According to the Catalan government, more than 1,000 people were injured during the elections held last year, which were caused by violent clashes at polling stations after police attempted to disrupt the election.
The group, which fought for independence, was planning to leave the camp by Friday night, with the intention of preventing a demonstration by supporters of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to go the other way.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who was with his wife at the separatist protest, said he no longer believed Catalonia could be independent.
Last year was one of our best.
My parents were crying for the choice, and now we are delayed.
The Catalan parties that had stood for independence despite losing the small regional election last December are trying to continue their work this year, with their most prominent leaders either going into voluntary exile or sitting in prison awaiting a court ruling to hold a referendum on independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who recorded the protest on his cell phone with the help of police, said the conflict was started by politicians from both sides.
The debate became more intense,  he said.
On Saturday, Orioles Junqueiras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison since late last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections for a second term.
The candidacy of a member of the European elections will not allow the Spanish government to continue the regression of democratic values and repression that we have just seen.
Londoners arrested for driving home
In London, men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after being hit several times in a house by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballinagard-Kresen on Thursday at around 19:30 local time.
According to detective inspector Bob Blemming, the gate and the building itself were damaged.
The car was also shot at some point with an arballet.
Menga's goal helped Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal in the Livingston goal ensured the team's victory.
Livingston surprised Rangers by sending manager Steven Gerrard to the postseason for the second time in 18 games.
Gary Holton's side was on the same level as Hibernia for the second time, but Dolly Menga's shot came out differently.
The team of Gerrard will face the leading team Harts, who are eight points behind, on the next Sunday of the Premier League this season.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Rapids of Vienna in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extended his undefeated streak in his division to sixth, with head coach Holt still feeling defeated after replacing Kenny Mailer last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity to make a run at the visitors.
Holt's team felt they had to be ahead before they could score, with a cleverness that posed a challenge to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson was able to pass, but his persistence at the goal was over, and then Alan Lithgow tried his luck, but the ball hit Craig Halkett's head and failed.
The owners let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could disturb the visitors during the pitch.
This was the goal.
With the Rangers passing the ball from the penalty area, Livington opened the scoring, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces against a penalty-scoring Menga.
By this time, the Rangers were leading, but decided that the home defense could not be passed, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was calm to a high degree.
This continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos kept Kelly.
Scott Pitman was confused in the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow hit the ball from the second position of Livingston.
Thus, the attack continued to the gates of Livingston, but was unsuccessful, however, after Halkett was called in to replace Glenn Middleton and two penalty requests for touching the ball were denied.
Fenomenal result from Livingston
With you in the Tony Macaroni Arena was Alasder Lamont, BBC Scotland.
It was a phenomenal effort and result for Livingston.
These guys played very well, exceeding expectations on the upper trajectory.
Their style of play and staff have not changed since their debut, but they should be grateful to Holt, who has lifted the spirits of the team.
He has so many heroes.
Captain HALKETT led a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrell in tension.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were not up to the standards, no matter how well they played during Gerard's time.
Their last ball, which was only once on the home field, should have been a sign for the "Reigners" who had fallen to the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a double welcome in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29) under the blue sky, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin with a smile.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which was aimed at re-establishing relations with NATO ally Germany.
They had been discussing human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Later, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a new, larger mosque.
For many Turkish citizens living outside Turkey, this city is like a second home.
The police, citing security concerns, blocked the crowd of 25000 gathered in front of the mosque, but many were able to get closer and see their predecessors.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters  mostly Kurds  also criticized Erdogan's political activities and the German government's decision to recall him to their country.
A two-sided split emerged: some German Turks greeted Erdogan as hero, while others were scolded as dictator.
Road accident in Detford: cyclist killed after being hit by a car
A cyclist died in London after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at 10:15 p.m. local time, south-east of the city, at the intersection of the busy streets of Beaswood and Evelyn in Detford.
The driver of the car behind the wheel stopped, medical personnel arrived, but the young man died on the spot.
The accident happened about a mile away on Saturday, a few months after another cyclist died in a collision on Childers Street.
The city police are conducting an identification operation, and the family will be notified.
Currently, motorists are advised to avoid the area because of traffic congestion and bus congestion.
Long-Lartin prison: six officers injured in clash
In the strict regime men's prison, six employees were injured in the clash, the prison administration reported.
The riots broke out at 09:30 local time on Sunday at Long-Lartin in Worcestershire and continued into the evening.
To put an end to the disturbances, which involved eight prisoners, special Tornado officers had to be called in.
Officers received minor wounds on the spot.
A prison official said: "Special trained prison staff were sent to the scene to stop the ongoing clashes in Long Lartin.
Six workers were injured.
We don't want to tolerate such clashes in our prisons, we hand over the guilty to the police, and of course they can spend more time behind bars.
The Long-Lartin prison houses more than 500 inmates, some of whom are the country's most notorious criminals.
In June, after a prisoner's attack, it was reported that the prison manager was being rushed to the hospital.
In October last year, during a serious riot, prisoners attacked with billiard balls, and OMON officers were called to the prison to solve the incident.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (Drought-prone areas may benefit)
Tropical precipitation is rare in Arizona, but it is expected to occur next week, with the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moving southwestward along the desert, causing flash flooding.
National Meteorological Service issued flash flood watches for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, on Monday and Tuesday.
Monday evening came with rain, and on Tuesday Rose was expected to cross Phoenix.
Phoenix National Meteorological Service notes in its report that since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have been designated as tropical storms or disasters.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) struck 40 miles from the Asian coast.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center expect rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with up to 6 inches in the segregated Mogollon Oblast of Arizona.
It will likely drop 1-2 inches around rocky mountains and large basins, eventually reaching up to 4 inches with its isolated locations.
In areas not threatened by sudden flooding, the Rose Rain can be seen as a blessing, as the region is experiencing drought.
Although flooding is a complex problem, some of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as drought is currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to American monitoring, at least 40% of Arizona is experiencing extreme drought, a category two event, reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa runs along the coast of the Lower California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, still with hurricane force, Rose was 385 miles south of Punt-Euchenia, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and moving north at 12 mph.
The storm will lose its strength when it encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean.
It is expected to make landfall on the coast of Mexico in the afternoon or on Monday evening with the force of a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall and flood risk are expected.
From Lower California to northwestern Sonora, 3-6 inches of rain is expected, weather.com reported.
Roza will move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, becoming a tropical depression before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning and moving south from Arizona to Utah by Tuesday evening.
The main threat from Rosa is extreme precipitation in the deserts of Lower California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern United States, the National Hurricane Center reports.
These rains are expected to cause sudden floods, debris flows in the deserts, and hail in the mountains, which are a threat to safety.
Attack on Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested in connection with attempted murder
After a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager, who was wounded, was found in the area of Excelsior-Terrass near Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday, summer time.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is now stable.
Police in Avon and Somerset said a 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Reddstock area overnight.
Police officers asked anyone with a note on their cell phone to report what had happened.
Trump said Kavano was suffering from "the evil of the Democratic Party".
"We need to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and vile tactics, so vote for Judge Kavano", Trump said in West Virginia's Wilmington.
Trump said Kavano had been plagued by "evil" from the Democratic Party since he announced his candidacy for the election.
Kavano testified Thursday before Congress, strongly and emotionally denying allegations that he raped Christine Blasey Ford several decades ago when they were young.
During the hearing, Ford also spoke.
On Saturday, the President said that the American people saw the extraordinary qualities and bravery of Kavano that day.
"Voting for Judge Kavano was a vote to endorse the candidacy of a lawyer who is the most brilliant legal mind of our era, who has served the public service with idealism", he told supporters of West Virginia.
The President, while noting that it was important for members of the Republican Party to attend the elections, also omitted the candidacy of Kavano.
There are 5 weeks left before one of the most important decisions of your life.
I have no part in this, I tell you".
That's why I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere.
Trump added that the Democrats were on a mission to stand up and be counted.
The first important vote in the Senate on Kavano's candidacy, as we know, should not be later than Friday, a senior aide to the Republican Party leader told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is rising
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed after a massive earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, with many washed away by powerful waves.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the city of Paulu on Friday to celebrate, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) high swept across the coast in the dead of night, destroying everything in their path.
Tsunamis occur after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
When the tsunami threat came, people were still helping with their work on the beach and died when they did not flee immediately, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come alone, it was followed by cars, trees, houses, said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami initially came at 800 km/h (497 mph) in the open sea before striking the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, he says, and that is how they survived.
About 16700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in the city of Palu.
Aerial photos taken by the Emergency Management Agency show mostly destroyed buildings, shops, bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The earthquake also weakened the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Application and Evaluation of Technology (BPPT) estimated that the energy released by Friday's earthquake was about 200 times the force of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city was reported to have been able to intensify the tsunami due to its location in a long, narrow bay.
Nugroho classified the damage as extensive, and reported that hundreds of homes, hospitals, commercial buildings and hotels were destroyed.
He added that some victims were found under parts of the buildings that were hit by the landslide, 540 people suffered various injuries, and 29 people are missing.
According to Nugroho, the greatest damage could be in the area around 300 km (190 mi) north of Palun, in the district of Donggala, close to the epicenter.
According to Nuгроho, communication with the city of Donggala was completely cut off.
It is home to more than 300 000 people, the Red Cross reported, adding that volunteers and workers had been dispatched to the affected areas.
He said: "It's a tragedy now, but it could be worse".
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not informing the authorities that the tsunami had hit Palu, but officials responded that the waves had come with the warning.
A video posted by witnesses on social media showed a man on the top floor shouting about the tsunami warning to people in the street below.
Within minutes, the wall of water hit the shore, washing away cars and buildings.
Reuters agency was unable to quickly confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage, which cut off communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
The authorities announced that they had begun sending military cargo aircraft from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still needed food and other first aid items.
The city's airport was opened only for emergency assistance, and was closed again until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation center in Palo on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has exceeded 800
This is a very bad situation.
From Dongalo, World Vision employees reported that they passed by the paintings of the void before they reached the breeze shelters inside the gates of their office in Palú.
They told me about seeing many ruined houses , she said.
This is bad.
Even after the relief groups began the process of providing assistance during the natural disaster, they were concerned that foreign workers, some of whom had extensive experience, would not be allowed to enter the territory of Paulu.
According to Indonesian rules, foreign financial, food, and personnel assistance can only be received when a disaster is declared at the national level.
No such announcement has been made yet.
The disaster is still only at the provincial level  says Auliya Arriaani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government declares a national disaster, we can call for international help, which we do not yet have such a status.
The following night, the following Friday, the friends and relatives of the missing believed that their loved ones would be miraculously found during the disaster.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman buried under the rubble, who had been crushed for two days by her mother's body.
Gendon Subandino, coach of the Indonesian national team in paraplanerism, trained the two missing paraplaners for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who had been invited to stay at the Hotel Roa-Roa, as well as Mr. Mandagi, were his pupils.
As the most experienced paraplanetist, I have my own emotional burden - she says.
Mr. Gendon said that after the destruction of the Roa-Roa hotel became known among the paraplaner organization, he sent a few hours of text messages via WhatsApp to the participants of the beach festival competition in Palus.
However, her SMS messages are marked only by one gray character, not two blue ones.
I think the SMS didn't get through,  says.
Thieves from the Neyport Entertainment Complex at the dam stole $26,750
On Friday morning, the robbers stole $26,750 from a Brink worker while he was filling the Newport ATM in Damba, according to the Newport Police Department.
The employee was about to take money from the ATM at the entertainment complex and take it to the next location, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a press release.
But when it was not empty, a man ran behind the bank employee and stole the bag, which was intended to be carried, along with the money.
Witnesses saw a number of suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not record the exact number of criminals involved in the situation.
Anyone with information about the perpetrators is invited to contact the Newport Police by cell phone at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced this on Twitter on Saturday, writing: Canye West is a creature.
The 41-year-old rapper was known for a while under the alias Ye, and even his eighth album, released in June, was named Ye.
The change was due to Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where his new album Yandhi is expected to be released.
According to the show's director, she will replace singer Ariana Grande, who had refused for emotional reasons.
Although this is an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word also has a religious meaning for West.
Ye is the most common word in the Bible, I think, meaning hin.  West made the album's title known earlier this year in a conversation with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
He moved from Kanye, which meant one, to a name that encompassed all our good points, our confusion, all of it - that simple Ye, that is, to you.
Who we are is reflected in the album.
He is one of the most famous rappers, with a name change.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he was giving preference to the names Love and Brother Love.
The Western collaborator JAY-Z also wrote his name with various letters, either without lines or with uppercase letters.
Mexico ' s leader vows not to use military force against civilians
The president-elect of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, promised not to use military force against civilians, as the 50th anniversary of the massacre of students approached.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador pledged on the Plaza de las Tres Culturas (Tlatelolco Plaza) that "military forces will never be used against the oppression of the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration on the square, military forces opened fire on students, killing nearly 300 people, a student movement that was typical of Latin America at the time.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans, to give monthly subsidies to those who study, and to open more public universities where teaching is free.
According to him, youths join criminal organizations because they are unemployed and have no opportunities to study.
US to double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding of research in this area, said Kai-Fu Li, an investor and former AI researcher at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Such comments began after reports of AI were made by parts of the US government, despite the fact that the US has no formal AI development strategy.
Meanwhile, China has presented its second annual plan: it aims to be No. 1 in innovation by 2030.
"Given that other countries are lagging behind the United States, it would be good to double the research budget for AI, and we are looking for further discoveries in the field of AI", Li said.
The doubling of financial support also increases the potential for the next major discovery in AI to be made in the US", Li said in an interview for CNBC.
His own book YSI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houthon Mifflin Harcourt, who is also the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in the most prominent Face++ YSI company in China.
In the 1980s, he worked on AI systems at Carnegie Mellon University, setting the highest records in the American game of Otello, and later became executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee is familiar with previous U.S. technological competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asks when the next competition will be held to help find the next genius.
Lee said U.S. researchers have to work hard to win government grants.
 Li says that corporations, not China, are getting academic leaders.
Recently, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from universities to work on AI.
Lee said the changes in immigration policy would also help the United States strengthen its position in the field of AI.
I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhDs in AI,  he says.
In July 2017, the Chinese government presented its second-generation development plan for AI.
Like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations that distribute funds to American researchers, the Chinese National Natural Science Foundation provides financial support to people in academic institutions, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense announced the creation of a joint artificial intelligence center, which includes partners from industry and science, and the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence at the White House.
And this month, DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million in research in AI.
He had not done anything for about a month or two since he wanted to form a commission.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would help resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece considers that its northern neighbors can claim their lands because of the name of the state, as it is a province called Macedonia, and opposes their accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents felt that the changes would have a devastating impact on the ethnic identity of the Macedonian population, which was mostly Slavic.
President Georgy Ivanov, after announcing that he would not vote in the referendum, expressed doubts that the boycott campaign would be able to reach 50 percent turnout for the referendum to become a reality.
The question asked in the bulletin was: Do you agree to accept the agreement with Greece and join NATO and the EU?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the change of the name of the state is a simple price to pay for joining the EU and NATO and that Macedonia, which emerged from the breakup of Yugoslavia, can pay for it.
"I came here today to vote for the future of my country, for the freedom of the young people of Macedonia to live under the wing of the European Union, because it promises a safe life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievski from Skopje.
Although the referendum does not necessarily have legal force, most members of parliament say it should be decided with the results of the election in mind.
A two-thirds majority of parliamentary votes are needed to change the name.
The government election commission said that no violations had been reported until 1 a.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 66 percent at the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 34 voters registered.
I came to vote for my children, because our place is in Europe, - said 62-year-old Yoze Tanevsky from Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko vote in a referendum on changing Macedonia's name to NATO and European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was walking in front of the parliament building, preparing a small stage and chairs for the organizers of the referendum boycott.
"We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to be on the same level with our heads held high", Kavadarkov said.
Our country is poor, but we have a conscience.
If they don't want to see us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, like China and Russia, and be part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, which has a 20% unemployment rate.
"I am sure that most people will agree, because 80 percent of our population supports joining the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said the result of the election confirmed our bright future.
The Macedonian Institute of Political Studies conducted a poll on Monday showing that the referendum had between 30 and 43 percent of voters, which is less than the required number.
A poll conducted by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV found that 57% of voters were going to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for эйе.
For a successful referendum, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious test for the Western-leaning government since it came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Serhio Aguero, who went through all of Brighton's defence to score a goal
Serhio Aguero and Raheem Sterling headed into Brighton's defence zone after Manchester City won 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in England.
In the 65th minute, Aguero made his maneuvers very easily.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the series.
He ran past three of Brighton's guards before he went out into the open.
Then, four green robes surrounded Aguero.
He passed one defender and several others on the edge of the Brighton bench.
He then found Sterling and gave him a pass to the bullseye.
The English forward used a penalty for a touchdown to return the ball to Aguero, who had already used his right boot to play off the Brighton defender, and scored on the right side of the set to Matthew Ryan.
According to Manchester City football club coach Pep Guardiola, the Aiguero footballer is currently suffering from leg pain.
We had already agreed that he would be in the game for 55-60 minutes.
And so it was.
The goal was a great joy for us.
However, in particular, the Sterling footballer led the Sky Blues to the top of the Premier League standings.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball at the bottom of the Brighton team's territory.
And LeRoy gave Sané a very good pass from the back flank.
Before leading Sterling to the distant sling, Sané developed a few masterful tricks.
Sky Blues forward sent the ball into the opposing team's goal just before leaving the football field.
The next group match of the Champions League between Manchester City and Hoffenheim will be played on Tuesday at 12:55 pm at the Rhein-Nekkkar-Arena in Zinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rookies
After Washington was eliminated from the playoffs for the Nationals, the need for a new team was no longer there.
However, Scherzer, who has always been competitive, hopes to beat the Colorado Rockies on Sunday; however, he has one condition - the Rockies must still have a chance to make the playoffs, currently one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of New Zealand.
In any case, the Rookies won the title last Friday against Nэшнлс 5:2, but they still wanted to consolidate their victory in the first division.
"I'm sure that even though we played for nothing, I'm going to experience the atmosphere of Denver here with the football fans and the other teams, and maybe the highest level of play this year.
Is there any excuse for me not to participate?
Although the Nationals announced the roster for Sunday's game, they reportedly decided to allow Scherzer to participate.
Scherzer, who will be 34th in the new lineup, will leave the bench for Thursday's game and will take the field as usual on Sunday.
This season, Washington had a 18-7 record with a 2.53 goals against average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Anti-Trump rally in West Virginia
When talking about the importance of the Republican Party's participation in the upcoming election, the President also omitted the Supreme Court-elected judge Brett Kavano.
Everything that has been done in our name may be put at risk in November.
We are just 5 weeks away from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
This is a particularly significant event - I am not voting, but I must try not to give up - so I am actively fighting for worthy candidates.
And Trump continued: "You can see how evil the radical party Democrats are.
They are determined to use any means necessary to regain power - they are ready to cause chaos and disaster.
They don't think about harming people at all - because they don't care - they only think about power and control, but we're not going to give them that.
According to the President, the Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
"You've been testifying to that for the last four days", Trump said, calling Democrats evil, dangerous, obnoxious and unreliable.
He addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee and named Democrat Senator Daienne Feinstein, which caused a public outcry.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I was expecting one thing - a very rude hand gesture - such bad behavior I had never seen.
The Labour Party did not accept any more.
People who like to express their opinions openly are not tolerated there
I was not surprised to see activists of the political organization of Momentum oppose me.
Finally, among those who were unhappy about having spoken out, I was the last Labour member of parliament.
My colleague Joan Ryan was similarly treated because of her firm stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of no confidence criticized my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
In a twist of fate, Jeremy had similar disagreements with previous party leaders over the importance of economic policy in Europe and national security.
We want our meetings to be open and productive for all The Labour of East Nottingham said in a statement about the meeting on Friday.
That's what happened to me as a Labour Party member of parliament for almost 8 years, and that's what happened to the General Conferences on Fridays.
Unfortunately, the congregations are not in a good mood these days, and the politics that gave hope to the white man have long been forgotten, even if they existed.
It is becoming increasingly clear that there is no tolerance for diversity in the Labour Party, and that each person's opinion is evaluated only in terms that are convenient for the party.
This started when Jeremy was the party leader, because my colleagues (who I think had similar political views with me before) for some reason expected me to make drastic changes, some of which I did not agree with at all - it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Every time I speak in public - it doesn't matter what I say - then I get a tease on social media about allowing elections, discussing politics, even being a member of the Labour Party.
Again, this is not my experience.
I'm sure some of my colleagues were less successful in this regard, because many of the comments I've received are political, so I know I'm being wild.
I am proud of my very professional and courageous colleagues who endure every day and endure every insult.
One of the biggest complaints of this political measure is the normalization of such extreme brutality.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn spoke about the need to promote a culture of tolerance in the Labour Party.
In fact, our party does not open its doors to everyone else - it always shrinks every time it expresses dissent or talks about changing its electoral system.
For the past two years, I have often received advice from people that if you keep your mouth shut, no one will touch you.
But I did not come to politics for her.
I joined the Labour Party as a schoolboy 32 years ago, and the reason for that was the disgraceful Thatcherite government - which almost destroyed my classroom at the public school I attended; I tried to provide and maintain better public services for all sorts of people - whether it was a local people's councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my past politics.
No one in East Nottingham has yet been implicated in my political disagreements with the current government.
I have only one word to say to the leader of the meeting on Friday - when the whole country is against Brexit, I am not obliged to waste my time, energy and loyalty on the leader of the Labour Party, because it is clear that Brexit will cause great damage to the House, to various organisations and to public servants.
But I want to say my only true word, not to the Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether or not there are Labour members among them: It is a great honour for me to serve you, and I promise you that nothing in the political unprinciples, nothing in the annulment of elections, will hurt me to emphasise the importance of protecting your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for East Nottingham
Er United  38:17 Melrooz : The undefeated Er team moves up the ranking
Perhaps the last two attempts would have changed the final result slightly, but it is certain that the team of Эр in the Premier League of Tennant will win the main triumph after today's spectacular match.
They are now at the top of the ranking, with no losses among the ten competitors.
At the end of the game, they showed an excellent defense and, thanks to this, they were able to take control of the football field, so coach Peter Murchi had every right to agree.
"We may have to go through such a difficult game, but we will not give up, so how can we not be happy", the coach said.
We repeat the words of Melrooz player Robin Christie: "Congratulations to Er United, they played this game better than us".
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's goal attempt was continued by Frayzer Klima, with the Ers taking the lead, but a yellow card was issued to Scotland's Worriorz player, Rory H Hughes - allowing the Mellroozs to tie the score and bringing the attempt to a close by Jason Begggot.
Climó led the Ers to the lead with a penalty, and scored just before the break, then made the score 17:5 in favor of Er.
However, the Melroozes started the second half well and Begggot made Patrick Anderson's attempt come true, narrowing the score to 5 points.
Ruairí then suffered a serious injury at the Nott, which caused him to be sidelined for a long time - the player had to be removed from the match; when the game resumed, Staffford's effort by MacDowell and Klima pushed the team further ahead.
Team captain Blar Macpherson was issued a yellow card and Melrooz was forced to pass another player because of Bruce Colvin, who was under too much pressure at the end of the game.
However, the owners of the field returned, but Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for snatching the ball from Klimo on the penalty area line, and MacPherson was left behind by the players of Ernesto.
Just like at the beginning of the period, Klimo sent another penalty and after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's ball, he passed the attacker Gregor Henry to try to score a fifth goal for the home team.
Hammam game star ends career in restaurant industry
It was revealed that the star of the game, Ford Kirnan, was planning to move into the hospitality industry after being named head of a licensed restaurant company.
Ford, 56, played Jack Jarvis on the BBC, in a popular sitcom with his former collaborator Gregory Hemfill, and wrote the script.
Together they announced that the upcoming ninth volume would be the last of the series, and it was noted that Kirnan had planned his own fate after Kreyglang.
According to official statements, he is currently the head of the company Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refused to answer questions about this, but a source in the newspaper Skoтиш San hinted that Kiernan would like to participate in a restaurant trade in Glasgow.
 The sea is ours : Bolivia , which has no access to the Pacific , hopes the court will reopen the way
The sailors are currently patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
The blue flag of the sea is waved on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon have even their own niche: the sea is rightfully ours.
Our main task is to bring it back.
In a landlocked Bolivia, the entire country still yearned to cross the Pacific Ocean and the coastline, and in the bloody disputes over resources in the 19th century, the waterway passed to the Republic of Chile.
The international court in Bolivia issued its decision on October 1st, the day of the most hopeful trial in the last decade.
"Our country has the drive, unity and tolerance, so of course we only expect results with a positive attitude", said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Calсадиlia.
After years of disorderly negotiations, Chile must consider an independent sea voyage, which will be confirmed by an international court in The Hague and hopefully watched by all Bolivians through blue screens.
Evo Morales, the influential indigenous president of Bolivia - who faces a controversial re-election next year - was also deeply affected by the court ruling on Monday.
In August, he vowed that the Pacific would be returned to us very soon.
However, some analysts believe that the court's ruling will not be in favor of Bolivia - although not much will change.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to influence the territory of the Republic of Chile, so it cannot be determined at a later stage of negotiations.
The Chilean international law expert Pas Sarate said the following about the situation: "The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice was issued only six months after the last hearing shows that the process was not very difficult".
Therefore, the last four years have not been in favor of Bolivia.
The question of opening a sea route was captured by the administration of present-day Bolivia, Sarate said.
He felt that President Morales' bellicose rhetoric had destroyed the last remaining goodwill of Chile.
Negotiations between Bolivia and Chile will continue, but it will be very difficult to conduct them after this.
The two countries have not held a diplomatic meeting since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia and his representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veultze, rejected the notion of a tribal court.
He said Monday was a great opportunity for the Bolivian people to build a new relationship with Chile and a mutually beneficial opportunity to end 139 years of conflict.
Morales was one of the most prominent presidents of Latin America; Kalsadilla, in turn, was surprised by his political handling of the maritime issue.
He said Bolivia would fight uncompromisingly for the right to open the sea.
The verdict is an opportunity for us to forget the past mistakes.
North Korea: Do not expect nuclear disarmament without trusting the United States
According to North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, the Korean people will never renounce nuclear weapons without showing confidence in Washington.
The minister made the remarks at the United Nations General Assembly on Sunday.
And the United States was asked to keep the promises it made at the Singapore summit.
The minister's comments surprised America, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared poised to resume the nuclear diplomacy that had stalled in Singapore three months earlier after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
With the continuing sanctions imposed by the United States and the rejection of demands for an end to the war in Korea, the eventual defeat of North Korea would remain a pipe dream.
Washington refrained from agreeing to the declaration until Pyongyang took the first significant disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump have expressed a desire to hold a second summit.
But he was not sure that Korea would give up its weapons so quickly, as this was the only guarantee of peace for the country.
To prepare for a summit between Kim and Trump, Pompeo planned to travel to Pyongyang the following month.
The latest collection of massive headwear presented at the Paris fashion show is on its way to the stores on the main street of your city
If you are looking for a new headgear or you like to completely cover yourself from the sun - look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented a series of elegant headwear from their SS19 collection on the podium and surprised the members of the entire Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, the uncomfortable hats filled the Instagram feed and the designers sent their creations around the podium.
Valentino's hat, which was a light brown color, with adult wings covering the heads of the models, was a class distinction.
Other major accessories included a turnip, pineapple, and a wizard's hat - but they won't keep your head warm.
Tom Brown showed in his clever masks that it would be right around Halloween time.
Even lipsticks were sewn on masks of various colors - in horror movies, it is not possible to call it high fashion.
One was a swimming device with a rope and glasses, and the other was like a melted ice jar.
If you're into high fashion - it's time to celebrate.
People who know will be happy - soon these infinity hats will be very close to your home.
The large-scale hats are seen as a replica of the La Bomb collection - she has tried wearing things from the straw, with edges almost a meter long - from singer Riana to model Emili Ratakovski.
The iconic sign, which was created by the uncomfortable hats, quickly spread on social media; they were followed by the huge muckers made of straw, which were so large that the model in a bathing suit could not see them.
A purple-yellow purse made of burnt rafia cloth, with a white leather strap and a rubber band sewn on the sides of the strap - Jacema La Riviera SS19 was the brightest element of the collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage said: "I expect to see the big-boxed hats in stores next summer, because the designers have made a big impact, and the sellers will feel the demand for older stuff".
Head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland, John Edward: Language education is required for all citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland support academic success very well, so individual and group student test scores for sport, culture, music and other community initiatives have performed very well in 2018.
The Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) is committed to providing the best possible service to pupils and their parents, with over 30 000 000 pupils in schools across Scotland.
The main task of independent schools is to prepare their students for their future higher education, career path and to find their place in the world.
As an education system that develops and introduces its program individually, we are convinced that modern language lessons are very popular and necessary.
Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, once said, "When you talk to someone who is learning a language, you are talking to their brain.
If you speak to someone in his native language, you are speaking to his heart.
These words remind us that we cannot rely on English alone to build strong relationships and trust with people in other lands.
According to the results of the exams held in independent schools this year, language learning is at the top of the list.
Among students who studied foreign languages, 68 percent of the students scored best.
Among 74 such schools, Chinese was the best represented by 72 percent, German by 72 percent, French by 69 percent and Spanish by 63 percent.
Independent schools in Scotland recognize that learning foreign languages is a skill that children will need in the future.
In the programs of independent schools and elsewhere, language learning is also often chosen among other subjects (science, engineering, and mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the Employment and Training Group in the UK found that 17% of job vacancies were due to a lack of language-knowing workers.
Therefore, the knowledge of foreign languages is becoming increasingly important, as it is the main issue for young people to get a good job.
As the need for language proficiency in promising jobs increases, it is essential to speak a foreign language in a globalized world.
Whatever profession a person who knows a second language chooses, his future life-long knowledge will always be a real advantage.
A person who can communicate directly with someone from another country will automatically always be ahead of the others.
In a 2013 survey by YouGov, 75% of over 4,000 adults in the UK spoke no foreign language and only French, compared to 10% who could communicate - a figure that turned out to be 15%.
This is why the emphasis on language learning is so important for modern children.
For someone who speaks several languages, it is always more desirable to get a full-time job, especially in developing countries.
In Scotland, each school will teach in a different language.
Some schools will focus on classical modern languages, while others will focus on those considered important for the UK in 2020, such as Chinese and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, independent schools will always have teachers who teach these subjects in several languages.
Scottish schools aim to create an educational environment that prepares children for the challenges ahead and teaches them to fight for success.
Today, in a global business environment, languages play a key role in the future of the country, and this should be reflected in education.
If not, modern languages should be considered as an exercise in international communication.
Independent schools will offer the opportunity, diversity and high quality of this education to the young people of Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire. (French for "You must do well in everything".)
Head of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland, John Edward.
In San Diego, LeBron will make his first start for the Lakers.
Fans of basketball fan James LeBron will soon see him in the Los Angeles Lakers.
According to Lakers coach Luke Walton, James will face the Denver Nuggets in the preseason opener in San Diego on Sunday.
However, the exact number of minutes played has not yet been announced.
The team's official website features more than a minute but less than 48 minutes of Walton's words.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudel tweeted that James would likely be given little playing time.
After training earlier in the week, James told his pre-season team of his plans for the next three games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need him to play pre-season", he said.
YouTube addiction: The moment for Trump's rallies in West Virginia
In the evening of today, President Donald Trump will begin a series of rallies in the West Virginia city of Wheeling ahead of the election.
This was one of five planned rallies, including in peaceful places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
After the Supreme Court delayed the president's confirmation of the election, Trump sought help from the upcoming midterm elections, as the Republican Party was determined to lose its lead in Congress if the elections were postponed to November.
When and how can Trump's rallies in West Virginia be watched online?
The rally was scheduled to take place at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018, on the Iti Tunayt channel.
You can also watch Trump's rally in West Virginia live on the internet at the link below.
Perhaps the president was forced to appeal to Bretta Kavanaugh, who was sitting on the Supreme Court, because of the sexual harassment allegations; this caused the Senate to postpone the election of a future sentencing confirmation, which was still being investigated by the FBI, by a week.
But the main issue of these rallies was to help the Republicans, who were facing a series of challenges in the run-up to the November elections, with some direction of development.
Thus, the five rallies for Trump's campaign next week are all about activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to grow and preserve their party with people in the House of Representatives and Senate, Reuters reported.
A Trump campaign spokesman, who declined to be identified, told Reuters: "The president's leadership of Congress is very important, so she's ready to travel all the states, and we'll be ready for the pre-election campaign season by then".
With the consent of Metro News of West Virginia, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media of Pittsburgh may attend the rally at the WESBANCO Arena in Willing today.
Trump, who was scheduled to arrive on Saturday, will make his second trip to West Virginia in the past month, where he received more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump was forced to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey.
"It's not a good thing for Morrissey to have to be promoted to president on a test", political scientist Simon Heather of West Virginia University told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: USA ready to fight for its hopes in Sunday's singles
After three one-goal games, Saturday's fourth golf competition was significant for the Ryder Cup.
Such a change of direction is a completely invented sport, but it is especially in such competitions that the athletes sincerely believe in it.
Where is the upward trend now?
One day of rest, golfer Jordan Spit said: "They were six points ahead, now they're only four, so we're not giving up because of the upward trend".
Albietta, the European side, is ahead by 4 points, 12 points in all games.
According to Spit, the Americans are currently very excited and motivated, because, for example, Spit and Thomas, who played together, can boast of three points scored out of four.
From start to finish, Spit was a courageous key player.
Every time he hit a decisive shot on the field, the celebration on the field echoed, as he had to fight Thomas for two points he had lost in front.
His goal on the 15th day of the match was met with the same echoes on the field, and the golfer's genuine desire to win showed his confidence in the American team.
"The others have to think more deeply and worry about their matches now", Spit said.
The players had little to worry about.
Only 18 points were not enough to leave a mark in history.
Only two players with a history of the Ryder Cup over the past two days, Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, were ahead of Spit and Tomás by a few points.
The volatile but well-known European golfers have four of the four possible points, so it should be all good.
In the Friday night, Saturday afternoon, and morning games, Francesco and Tommy did not have a single boggy (the number of shots that they had to make in one nest).
If Molinari and Flitwood were to emerge as the all-European winners on Sunday at Le Golf Nacional, there would be no more famous golfers than them, because they have such a strong passion in their hands, in their fans.
As expected, two players won't win in two separate nests.
However, it is still too early to talk about a European-wide sign.
Bubbba Watson and W. Simpson quickly beat the hero, Serhio Garcia, by four balls in the morning game, and he, in turn, played in a pair with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard Garcio and the Swede Noren were left behind with two doubles (more than the double of a shot that should have been done in one nest) with one boggy.
Of course, on Sundays, no one can help you.
It was especially interesting to watch the four golfers: how they interacted, what advice they gave, which ones they followed and which they didn't, and how the game changed in the blink of an eye.
In fact, the European team had shown much better results, for example, even going ahead in the final game, but this four-match game proved that America had the courage to fight, even if it was less trusted in the States.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10: 6
After the four-player match on Saturday, Europe led America 10-6 and that was a big advantage for them in the final game of the Ryder Cup.
The winged duo of Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood beat Tiger Woods on the field of Le Golf NacioNal to tie the score at four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was about to take first place, beat the American team in the series 3:1 in the morning game after being behind at the Heseltine Golf Club two years ago.
The United States won two matches in a row, but they were not able to score enough points.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in 12 singles games on Sunday to retain the trophy.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, Flitwood was the first European opening golfer to score four consecutive points, while she and Molinari (named Moliwood after their shocking weekend games) were the only other duo to win four points in their first four games.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed, they also bravely defeated American starter Bryson DeShambo, 5-4.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, lost 19 of his 29 games between the four men despite having some bright moments in his time in the game.
After a brief rest after the four-match morning session, Justin Rose returned to his partner Henrik Stenson and lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who had taken first and third place in the world competition.
Although the weather was nice and fresh on the southwestern side of Paris, the European team did not fare so well.
The winners of the triple tournament, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set a new American control mark on Saturday with two points.
They won 2-1 in a fierce battle against the Spaniards John Ram and Jan Poulter and later came back to beat Polter and Rori Maquilroy in four-a-side games with a score of 4:3.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, only twice has a team been shut out in singles with four points missing, and a tie would have been enough for Furick's team to keep the trophy.
If they were second in strength for two days, it looked like Sunday's counterattack would be out of reach.
North Korea has reported that "no unilateral disarmament without confidence will ever be possible".
On Saturday, the South Korean foreign minister said that the continued US sanctions on the United Nations would only increase mutual trust between the countries, so it is unlikely that nuclear disarmament will be discussed in these circumstances.
He agreed with the announcement at the annual General Assembly of the World Organization by Minister Ri Yong Ho that North Korea had made important commitments in the past year: to complete nuclear and missile tests, decommission nuclear testing sites and pledge non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
"But we have not seen an equal response from the United States", the minister said.
"Without any trust in the United States, we will have no national security, and under these conditions we cannot unilaterally disarm".
While Minister Ri's complaints about Washington's lack of response to the slow changes in North Korea were familiar, his statements were felt to be correct, as last year Pyongyang was completely opposed to a single-party arms-decentralization.
In his message, Ri recalled the agreement reached at the first joint summit of President Donald Trump and leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore on June 12, when the leaders of the two countries promised each other that Korea would begin disarmament efforts and that America, in turn, would guarantee their security.
North Korea had been waiting for the official end of the Korean War of 1950-53 to be reached, but America had to wait for Pyongyang to first completely renounce nuclear weapons.
Washington, in turn, has sought to soften tough international sanctions on Korea.
"America insisted on disarmament first and therefore resisted even the pressure of sanctions to declare the end of the war", says Ri.
Sanktions are people who have made vain dreams about bringing us to our knees, who do not know our country at all.
In fact, the sanctions that did not end the continuation only exacerbated our distrust.
Ri did not say anything about plans for a summit between the leaders of the two countries at the United Nations, which would commemorate the American president.
The minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months: "If we had South Korea on the side of the insurgency in this period instead of America, we would not be in a difficult position to go backwards and forwards".
The General Assembly confirmed that the North Korean launch of missiles into the United States was inevitable because Trump had in the past called Kim "the missile man" because of his "Mr. Bad President".
This year, at the United Nations, the American president, who had threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praised leader Kim for taking steps to disarm, but said that sanctions would remain in place without North Korea's centralization, so many of the things ahead should be taken first.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for that: "If you give this question two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have spoken to the United Nations Security Council on the need to reward Pyongyang for its actions.
Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations Security Council on Thursday that the implementation of the sanctions by the Security Council must continue without interruption, until the work on a strict, complete decentralization is completed.
The Security Council unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea beginning in 2006, in an attempt to cut off Pyongyang's funding of its missile and nuclear programs.
He met with Pompeo Ri from the United Nations General Assembly and shared his plans to return to Pyongyang the following month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not very successful.
And in July, he returned from Pyongyang and confirmed that he had good results, but only a few hours later, North Korea accused the politician of making dangerous demands.
At a meeting earlier this month, North Korea promised Moon that it would withdraw from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Missile and Nuclear Affairs if the United States did not take appropriate measures.
According to him, for Kim, these "appropriate measures" were only a guarantee of security that Trump had made mandatory in Singapore, and were designed to facilitate good communication with Washington.
A lesson in proper rest for Harvard students
A new class at Harvard University forced students of all recent generations to sleep more - a measure designed to counter the culture of caffeinated sleepless nights among students.
Some of the most educated students at the world's most prestigious university have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Цейслер, a professor at Harvard Medical School, a tradesman at Brigham Young University and the Women's Hospital, prepared a special course that he said was unique in America.
He was inspired to start this work after talking about how lack of sleep affects reading.
After the lecture, a young woman came to the professor and said, "Why am I hearing about this only recently, only in my last year?"
The professor was surprised that no one had told him about the importance of sleep, according to the student, who wrote in the Telegraph.
The course, which was released for the first time this year, explains to students how sleep helps them in both studying, sports and overall well-being.
According to Paul Barreyra, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and acting director of the university's health service, the university decided to include the course after learning how students had been sleep deprived for a week.
The lesson lasts an hour and contains many interesting, interactive questions.
For example, in the picture of the bedroom, students stand on coffee cups to explain the importance of caffeine, standing on the rocks, and sleep deprivation, and even teach what to do before going to bed.
Students then learned that insomnia can lead to heart attacks, strokes, depression, and even cancer.
The floor plan of the study area with various interactive signs makes the class audience think about how they should spend their day.
We know that the behavior of students cannot be changed now.
But they should have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about the harm of smoking", added Professor Цейслер.
According to him, the culture of sleepless night preparation for exams is in the background, especially as modern technologies and the increasing difficulty of studying make sleep deprivation a major problem.
Convincing students of the importance of adequate sleep would be a secret weapon against stress, fatigue, and overwhelm, and even a way to avoid the problem of obesity - because less sleep causes the brain to eat more.
The 19-year-old from California, Raymond So, studied chemical and physical biology; he helped Professor Цейслер to organize the class better after he started taking it in the first year.
She said that she liked the lesson so much that she decided to make it a general education lesson.
His hope, the next step - to ask the aspirant students about the passing of this course before placing them in other educational places.
Professor Цейслер advised students to install an alarm clock at both bedtime and waketime, and also to remember the dangers of blue screens and light-diode lamps.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks out Gerrard
In the away game, the Rangers suffered another defeat, losing 1-0 to the team of Steven Gerrard.
After a 4-1 triumphal win over St. Johnston in February, Ibroxa were confident of their first win in a away game, but Gary Holtan's team suffered their second defeat to coach Gerrard in 18 games, leaving his team 8 points behind and passing the reigning Premier League leader Lendbrockers Hartz.
With 7 minutes to go, Menga scored, and the first goal was not enough to satisfy the Rangers.
While Rangers fell to sixth place, they moved up to third place for Livingston, only one ball behind Hibernia.
Other uncomfortable conditions could be expected for the Ranger, as the lineman (judge on the sideline) Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit by something on the main line.
He made eight substitutions in the team, beating Erb in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, who had scored a goal from Hart a week earlier, competed against the same team of 11 from Lynwingston and his excellent training beat them every step of the way.
Maybe the Rangers had the ball, but the Livingstons had a better shot.
They should have scored within two minutes of Mengie Scott Pitman being sent off for a pass by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder used his big opportunity.
Keegan found a deep punch in Jacobs's penalty kick by captain Craig Halkett, but his partner in defense Alan Lithgow managed to hit with a backstop.
He took his watch in the Rangers' fight, but in their third half there was more hope than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos felt he should have scored in the 15th minute after a collision with Stephen Loules, but the referee, Stephen Tomson, refused the Colombian's statement.
In the first half, Reyners scored twice in the goal, but former goalkeeper Ibroxa's Liam Kelly was not bothered by the ball being hit by Lasana Kulibali's head and Ovi Ejarairie's hand.
The first match was over and it was clear in the 34th minute that Livi had won, and perhaps no one would have denied that they had won by paying.
Once again, the Rangers failed to beat the highly trained Jaycobs.
Scott Robinson, who kept cool by picking Menga for a simple finish, was passed by Declan Gallagher, but Scott Arfield did not notice.
Gerrard decided to replace Kulibaly with Oayana Kent during the break, and this replacement had the same effect when the attacker replaced Morelosa, but affected Kelly's landing on his block line.
However, Livingston would often invite the visitors to a game they liked: Lyttow and Halkett always got the ball in the back.
Holt's team could have increased the margin in the final stage, but McGregor was able to hold on to eliminate Jacobs before being knocked out in the corner by Lithgow.
Glenn Middleton of the Rangers, who was substituted, missed another penalty in the tie with Jacobs, but Tomson missed again.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter
The time for this Sunday morning edition of the Almanac is 136 years ago, September 30, 1882, and, we count..... the birthday of the future German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger.
Geiger invented a method for protecting and measuring radioactive material, which is now known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has been a useful tool in many sciences, even being filmed - in the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado with scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The questioner: Why is this necessary in the world?
Rogers: This thing is called a Geiger counter and it helps us find where radioactive minerals are located, like uranium.
If you put your ear to it - you can actually hear the radioactivity of the minerals.
Evans: Listen, there are really explosions!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But what he thinks lives on in the universe.
New vaccine against cancer teaches human immunity to see bad sides
A new vaccine against cancer teaches the human immune system to detect and eliminate malignant cells.
This vaccine is seen as a way to direct the detection of bad edges.
This methodology also includes removing edges from a person and modifying them in the laboratory.
He was then able to detect and re-introduce a protein present in many common cancers.
The vaccine tested showed excellent results in various cancers.
A woman with ovarian cancer was cured of her disease for 18 months by this vaccine.
In this technique, the vaccine detects the bad edges, then removes them from the person and modifies them in the laboratory, where it can then detect and re-insert a protein called HER2, which is present in many common cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute of America in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results are very promising.
According to Professor Berzofski, HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of cancer, such as breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancer.
This relationship has helped to cure some types of leukemia.
Kanye West made a speech on Saturday Night Live in support of Trump.
But the graduation did not go well.
On Saturday Night Live, Kanye West was humiliated after being released from prison for supporting Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
When she released her third song, Ghost Town, she wore a Trump-themed helmet, and then began to speak out against the Democrats and show her support for the president.
I've talked to a lot of white people and they've asked me, How come you like Trump, he's a racist?
If I cared about racism, I would have left America long ago", she said.
The show Sated Night Liv began with a parody starring Matt Damon; the Hollywood star was mocked for how she had given testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual misconduct allegations of Christine Bleici Ford.
Although West was not shown on blue screens, the blue-eyed Chris Rock posted a few shots on social media.
It is unclear whether the publication was intended to humiliate the Rock singer.
West also told the audience how difficult it was for her to wear that headgear backstage.
Backstage, I was ridiculed.
They said, "We don't even think about putting it on".
Backstage, I was ridiculed!
And they looked at me very distantly", he told the Washington Examiner.
And West continued, "If you come to see an outcast, don't look at me, because I'll wear somebody's headgear if I want to, and I'm not going to ask you what to do".
Please be more humane.
His words were at least twice answered with gusto among the audience and were echoed by the actors present, and one witness who was there told the magazine Вериити: The whole studio was awfully quiet for a long time.
Kanye West was invited to the show to replace Ariana Grande as the singer, as her boyfriend, the famous rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
The singer was dressed like a sprite bottle and surprised everyone with a song that she said she liked.
Tipyueesay conservative leader Kendis Turner tweeted in support of the singer: To the bravest man: Thank you so much for standing up to the mob!
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just being herself and it was so weird.
But I will not live with a man who makes my people laugh, listening to his songs and buying his clothes.
He is a free man.
And we are free as he is.
Before the show, the rapper had tweeted that he was forced to change his name now my official name is not Kanye West.
He was not the first artist to change his name: the famous star Diddy, whose other names seem to follow Paff Daddie, Pafffi and Pi Diddy.
During his time as a rapper, Snoop Dogg used the name Snoop Lion, and of course, it is known that the late artist changed his name to Prince.
Man killed in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was arrested in Belfast for stabbing a man in a restaurant in the east of the city.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballihacamor.
The defendant is due to appear in the Magistrate's Court on Monday.
The indictment will be accepted by the Public Court.
Game of Thrones star of the show, Keith Harington: toxic youth
Kitt Харингтон is best known for his heroic lead role in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor broke the hero's spell: according to him, men who often play such roles often need to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Keith said the issue was acute and he was concerned about how to solve it in the activist era.
Recently, Keith married the star of Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rozi Leslie - an actor who has expressed his willingness to solve the problem.
I ask myself now, when did we create the problem of men?
How are we supposed to raise our sons now that this is a problem?
According to the actor, the television is largely responsible for the problem.
And he goes on: Is it born or is it learned?
What is it that they teach on television, outside, that boys often have problems with being boys?
I think that's the most important question right now - how can we change this?
Because it is understandable that something went wrong for young men at times.
In this conversation, Kit expressed his desire not to participate in any of the upcoming Game of Thrones sequels, as he was tired of fighting shows.
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's film True West, about the producer and his brother-claimer.
Recently, actor Keith was right that the best thing about Game of Thrones was that it turned out to be Rosie.
I met my fiancee in that language, and from then on I built my family.
In the Emmy-winning fictional series, she played Rozi Keith's favorite character - Igrit.
In June 2018, the couple married in the house of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV and AIDS: China reports 14% increase in infection rate
China reported a 14% increase in infection growth among HIV and AIDS patients.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second half of 2018, it was reported that about 40 000 new cases were detected.
Most of the new cases of infection were sexually transmitted, due to the history of the disease.
Traditionally, in some parts of China, HIV is contracted by bloodletting.
But the number of people infected in this way is now almost non-existent, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In the same year, the number of HIV and AIDS cases increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted infections of HIV are a major problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but is considered extremely offensive to the LGBT community.
Due to conservative values in the country, 70-90% of LGBT male recruits end up taking women as brides, according to known materials.
The disease is caused by a lack of sexual protection.
To help with this, the Chinese government has pledged to increase the availability and availability of HIV vaccines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies the Republican Party's leak of data and has criticized the anti-US conspiracy theory and the "dangerous deception" theory.
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters, one of the House of Representatives, exposed allegations that one of the representatives had posted personal information about three American Republican senators on the Internet.
According to the Los Angeles Democrat, these unfounded claims were backed up by unknown experts and websites.
In a tweet, Waters said it was "a lie, a lie and nothing but a disgusting lie".
The data collected included home addresses and telephone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information was posted on the Internet on Thursday and was posted on Capitol Hill during the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano.
The riot occurred after three senators questioned Kavano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address of the source was associated with Waters's account and that the information was posted by someone at Waters.
There is no correct message in this message, Waters said.
The personal data and safety of a member of my office has been compromised by these false allegations, and he should not be held responsible for it.
There is no correct message in this message, Waters said.
Waters's words were immediately echoed in the media, with former White House press secretary Ari Flaycher saying:
He wrote, "A very bad language".
This behavior showed that he could not be a member of Congress.
If a person is accused of doing something wrong, he should not be so much.
He must be calm.
He should not be able to argue with the accusers.
She must be quiet.
Flaysher, according to the observer, compared Waters's opposition to Kavano's, who was angered by the judges at Thursday's hearing for his poor response.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate, was forced to stand in for Waters in the upcoming election and tweeted his thoughts:
If true - it is a very surprising situation.
Wothers reported that law enforcement officials had reported false statements.
We will find the perpetrators and they will be brought to the legal entity's responsibility, because such actions are more shameful for each member.
Agent Johnny English film prequel to the spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to find something about Brexit in every film - so it seems that this is what will happen with the re-released comedy franchise; the 2003 Johnny English comedy was re-released in 2011.
Will this film that makes you laugh be a new export opportunity for our country?
However, the more subtle Johnny English with ball-eyed and rubber-faced faces was given a second release and a license to be all-Bulgarian - a film that, according to cinematographers, is a work of wide humor, but it was released for non-English speaking countries.
Of course, he's just a more subtle spy, and his more aggressive demeanor, his resemblance to Mr. Bean and even his voice, which is similar to the singer at the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony - makes him such a unique hero.
He is also a hero, embodied in the image of a traveler and a mysterious man, played by Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclayard adventure.
There are a few very interesting minutes of Johnny English coming out of the last one.
I loved watching Johnny English come to the helicopter, dressed in a medieval uniform and having the helicopter's air screws hit his guard several times.
Atkinson's ability for a gritty comedy is well known, but his level of humor is too weak and excessive, as modern serious films such as 007 and the irresistible mission have a good sense of humor.
To me, this humor seemed to be aimed at children from the perspective of adults, and Johnny English's wild behavior was no longer amusing, and the silent movie Mr. Bean was even more amusing.
The fact that the UK is now in a very vulnerable position is an ever-present concern.
To the surprise of a small role-developing agent for Kevina Eldon, a cyber-hacker somehow managed to get into the most secretive British intelligence organization and began to reveal the names of other agents.
This was the last straw for the newly-emerged prime minister, whose reputation was in a bad shape: although actress Emma Thompson was completely committed to the role of the fake Theresa May, the script was not that difficult.
His advisers told him that he would have to bring back some retired agent because the name of every active spy was known.
And this retired Johnny English, who is now a teacher at a rich school and, unfortunately, gives lectures on espionage, that episode alone seemed a little bit funny to me.
English was quickly sent back to Whitehall for an emergency organization, where he was reunited with his former but merely helpless assistant, Bow - played by the late Ben Miller.
Bow is now a family man, his bride is like a commander, and this fun role is like being played by Vicky Pepperdine for nothing.
Thus, Batman and Robin are reunited, and they make a terrible mistake in the Queen's Secret Service, where they meet the beautiful Ofelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is tricked by a very charismatic technological billionaire; he convinces the minister that he will eliminate all of Britain's computer problems, and this evil Jason Walt is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bow begin their journey of laughter: dressed as waitresses, they light a fire in a French restaurant, they go on a real binge ride on Walt's luxurious yacht, and English gets a head-banging virtual reality headset.
I'm not going to go into the rest of the film, but of course, the humor of this film is just for kids.
It was a very average movie.
And finally, in the wake of Johnny English's other films, I ask myself: Couldn't the British film industry have given such a talented Rowan Atkinson a more appropriate role?
The Labour Party refused to develop a plan designed for the British to work four days but be paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party devised a plan designed for the Bitanese to work four days but be paid for five.
According to reports, the money collected due to artificial intelligence will be paid to the workers by the company's management for the fifth day.
Thus, the workers would enjoy three days of rest, but would take home the same amount of money.
According to sources, this idea fits well with the financial side of the party and the country's plans for a rapprochement with the workers.
The transition to a four-day workweek was supported by the trade union Congress as a direct way for people in employment to take advantage of the opportunities of a rapidly changing economy.
A source in the Labour Party told the Sunday Times: "These political changes are expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It will not happen soon, but a four-day workweek is more appropriate for the party's move towards a correct economy and general industrial plans.
The Labour Party was not the first to make such plans - in 2017, the Green Party made a series of pre-election statements with a four-day system.
However, this effort was not entirely opposed by the Labour Party.
Party spokesman: Four-day work is not party policy and we cannot worry about it now.'
Chancellor John MacDonnell held a Labour conference last week to focus his views on social change in the economy.
According to McDonnell, it was important to him to regain control of the directors and speculators.
These plans of the Chancellor further explained the possibility that the shareholders of the water supply companies could not get their share, as the Labour Party could send different results to the government in case of disorder.
He also proposed plans to include ordinary workers in the board of directors of companies and to create funds for the transfer of property, which would be divided annually by the employees of private firms by 10% of their capital.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy spoke on the political television show "60 Minutes" about the possibility that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the indictment of Judge Brett Kavano delayed the final selection of his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week and put the question on the table - can the results of the bureau be relied upon to support Republican senators?
In a Sunday episode of 60 Minutes, reporter Scott Pellley spoke about how the FBI investigation could change the minds of Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham.
Kennedy was more forthright than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Absolutely", said Kennedy.
I spoke with Judge Kavano, who was supposed to be at the hearing.
When I learned about this, I immediately called him and asked him, 'What is the matter with you?'
He was very determined, bold and one-word".
However, Graham's voice seemed unchanged.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavano, but it will require a very strong indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett has absolutely refused", Graham added of Christine Bleici Ford.
"And no one can prove to you that this is what he said.
He is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
Did it help with the Global Citizens' Day and did it help with poverty in any way?
This Saturday, New York City will host an annual music event - the Global Urban Festival, featuring influential stars as it addresses a critical issue - how to fight poverty.
Now, after seven years of the event, tens of thousands of people gather on the Elder's Lawn in Central Park to watch not only the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also the ultimate goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens' Day, announced in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project to Fight Poverty - an international advocacy organization whose main goal is to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
If you are not ready to get a VIP-ticket, a spectator will have to do various activities to get a free ticket, such as volunteering, sending a letter to a world leader, calling and other impactful activities that raise this issue.
But during those 12 years, did the Festival produce any fruitage?
Is the idea of giving away free concerts the right way to convince real people, or is it just a case of clictivivism - the belief that signing petitions and posting posts online brings real benefits?
Since 2011, the Global Citizens' Day has recorded more than 19 million support cases and disputed cases among them for various purposes.
According to reports, these goals have forced various world leaders and politicians to commit more than $37 million worth of financing to support more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the event organizers reported that 390 projects had been paid or collected, totaling about $10 billion.
According to the organization, the money raised so far has already killed at least 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most important mandatory actions is the British investor and executive organization The Power of Nutrition, whose main goal is to help children. Thanks to 4700 tweets written in their name, the organization has promised to donate $35 million to the country of Rwanda to fight the problem of malnutrition.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, the people's government and people everywhere, we can end hunger forever", Tracey Ullman, a spokesperson for the organisation, said at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also reiterated that after more than 5000 steps were taken to address the nutrition problem of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced a project to finance more than 5 million mothers.
One of the most frequently asked questions is How will we eradicate extreme poverty?"
The festival website responds: "This journey will be long and difficult - it will be in difficult times.
But if we remember the great human rights protests that have been forgotten for a long time, we will definitely win this war, because unity is strength.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Ja'anel Monet are the stars who will perform at this year's event; the New York festival will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
US Interior Minister: We can use the Navy to block Russia ' s energy exports
Washington, citing US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink, said that it could, if necessary, use its naval forces to demand exports of Russian energy sources, which is what the Washington Examiner is referring to in the Middle East.
According to Zinké, Russia's involvement in Syria is not in vain, especially since the situation created by the Legitimate Government is only a pretext for investigating the energy market.
"I think the reason Russia is a frequent guest in the Middle East is that they are intermediaries in the energy sphere, because the same is true in Eastern and Southern Europe", the minister said.
According to the authorities, the means and ways of solving this problem are diverse.
"The United States has a very open Navy and a free market access to its energy resources when necessary", he said.
Zinké addressed the participants of the meeting of non-profit organizations organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, who considered themselves the voice of the energy consumers of the United States.
He compared Washington's position to the situation in Russia and Iran, saying that they were identical.
"The only option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel", he said, noting that Russia's profile is limited because the Russian economy is tied to the fuel fields.
These statements came after the Trump administration put before itself the issue of increasing natural gas exports to Europe and selling them at much lower prices in order to squeeze out Russia.
The US president Donald Trump and his administration have urged Germany not to participate in the construction of the Nord Stream-2 project, which is expected to increase Russia's influence in Europe.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline, which cost 11 billion dollars, will double its capacity to 110 billion cubic meters and is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin maintained that Washington's fierce opposition to the project was purely economic and an example of dishonest struggle.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak stated at his September meeting in Moscow with US Energy Minister Rick Perry: "I think energy resources should not be a tool of pressure and consumers have the right to choose their own suppliers".
The negative position of the United States had a negative impact on Germany, which agreed to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation, advised the United States to stay away from the Organization for Energy Policy and the Berlin-Moscow bilateral agreements.
After a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation, said: "I would be in a difficult position if a third country intervened in our energy issue".
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has said she plans to run for president in 2020.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts confirmed that she intends to run for president after the midterm elections.
In the administration building in Holiock, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed his intention to run for president.
The New York Times quoted her as saying: "It is time for women to go to Washington and change the government's attitude toward us and give us the right to run the country".
I will seriously consider my participation in the presidential elections after November 6.
Worren expressed his opinion that US President Donald Trump was not leading his district in the right direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Worren, however, courageously gave Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano his negative assessment.
On Friday, he wrote on his Twitter feed: "Of course, we're going to need an FBI investigation before the election".
However, according to the results of the poll published on Thursday, many voters are not satisfied with Warren's participation in the 2020 election.
According to a Boston Globe poll conducted by the Center for Political Research at Suffolk University, 58% of Massachusetts voters believe the senator will not win the election.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The state's former governor, Patrick Deval, received the most votes in the polls; in a potential race, 38 percent supported and 48 percent opposed.
In the run-up to the 2020 presidential election, he was mentioned alongside other prominent Democrats as former vice president Joe Biden and senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make his official decision in January.
Sarah Palin told Donald Trump's voters at a rally: "My son has a traumatic brain injury".
The 26-year-old Trac Payn served in Iraq for a year.
On Monday night, he was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
"I understand very well the other families, when my son came back from the war, our soldiers brought back not physical wounds, but wounds of the soul", he said at a rally of voters for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paynlin called the arrest of his son a "troubling issue" and said that his son and other veterans would return from the war changed and tough-hearted. They were concerned only with one question - how much respect they had for the soldiers and soldiers they had sacrificed for their country.
According to police department spokesman Dan Bennett in Wasila, Alaska, Payn was arrested on suspicion of domestic assault - he assaulted a woman with a drunk weapon.
18 states and the District of Columbia oppose new US policy on housing
The District of Columbia and eighteen states have a legal favorable view of U.S. policy toward supporting criminal groups, domestic violence, and abuse.
To deny such a policy, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia in Washington, D.C., filed a petition Friday to the court advisory to protect refugees, NBC News reported.
In August, the American Free Cities Union issued a decision that did not include Grace's real name in the legal action against Sessions against federal policy.
Grace was persecuted by her partner and members of the gang, the Blood Sons of Wu, but the United States refused to grant her asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who defend Grace consider gangs and domestic violence in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala to be the most common problems, as these countries have the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States.
A new US law from 2014 reversed a decision by the Immigration Council to grant asylum to undocumented refugees fleeing domestic persecution.
On Friday, the Attorney General of the District of Columbia, Carl Razin, noted that the new policy "cancels state, federal and international laws".
The court advisory stated that all appeals under the Federal law were considered as separate concrete facts and circumstances, and that the prohibition invalidated all principles.
The policy of not admitting refugees is damaging to the US economy, as most would be entrepreneurs and create jobs, the lawyers said in their appeal.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June allowed immigration judges to no longer grant refugees asylum.
In its statement of 11 June, Seshns said: "Asylum is only granted to certain social groups who are persecuted or threatened on the basis of their race, religion, nationality or political beliefs".
Refuge has never been a solution to all problems, even the big problems of everyday life on the planet.
The number of people killed in search and rescue operations in Palu has doubled
The situation was difficult for the survivors.
In an evacuation center in the city of Palu, 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma said that the situation was very tense, comforting her son who was in a difficult situation.
An ambulance will pick up the injured every minute.
There is a shortage of fresh water.
People were seen trying to save the flooded belongings of those returning to their homes.
The 7.5-magnitude quake destroyed hospitals and injured hundreds of people.
Some of the wounded, including Dwyane Harris, who had broken his back and shoulder, remained in the Army Hospital of Palou, where patients were treated outdoors due to prolonged tremors.
He was moved to tears when he remembered the powerful earthquake when he lived in a hotel room with his wife and daughter.
There was no time to escape.
I think I was squeezed by the walls", Harris told the Associated Press, adding: "We were in town with our family for a wedding".
I heard my wife screaming for help, then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I'm sure they'll be safe.
The American ambassador blamed China for the use of propaganda advertising.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper American Daily made a four-page advertisement about the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of propagandizing the US press.
Last Wednesday, US President D. Trump published a paid advertisement for the China Daily publication in the Des Moines Register, citing a best-selling newspaper in Iowa, accusing China of interfering in the November 6 US congressional elections, but China denied the accusation.
US officials told Reuters that Trump accused Beijing of creating a new campaign in Washington to increase pressure on China over its interference in the US election.
Due to their trade wars, Beijing and Washington were forced to balance import tariffs, while other countries were promoting their goods through advertising.
Chinese and American experts believe that new tariffs have been developed in China to reduce exports from other states, such as Iowa, for Trump's support of the Republican Party.
According to Terry Branstad, former U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, who sells agricultural products to China, Beijing has harmed American workers, farmers and enterprises.
In his article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstead wrote: "China is now conducting a double whammy by publishing propaganda in our free press".
"The Chinese leadership uses paid advertising from the Des Moines Register to promote its propaganda using American traditions of free speech and press", wrote Bransted.
Conversely, you will not find articles in the Beijing newspaper kiosks that cover the Chinese people who disagree with the government's policy and their worried economic development, because press materials are under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
A prominent Chinese newspaper objected to the publication of his article, though he did not say which press.
Analysts say Republicans are sidelining women who are elected in the midterm on the example of Kavano's failure.
Many Republicans support and support Brett Kavano's candidacy for the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault; they will see a negative reaction in the inter-election period, especially by women, the analyst noted.
In this tense time, most Republicans expressed their desire to vote.
Professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, Grant Richer, said in an interview with The Hill in its Saturday edition: "It's irreversible".
Richard was doubtful whether the unexpected demand of Arizona State Senator Jeff Flake, who said an FBI investigation would be enough to silence angry voters, would be reassuring.
As reported by Washington, D.C., on Friday, senior advisor and international press secretary of the progressive group Move on Karin Jean-Pier noted: "It was a woman's night, and it will not be forgotten tomorrow or in November".
According to the Mic news agency, when they saw Kavano in the Senate corridor on Friday, protesters organized a demonstration under the slogan "November is coming!" because Republicans monitoring the Judiciary Committee were not considering the testimony of Kristin Blaysey Ford and were going ahead with Kavano's candidacy.
According to independent political analyst Stu Rotenberg, "This will be a matter of interest to citizens".
It is still a popular saying and it is true.
But it may be higher, especially among hesitant women voters in the suburbs and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who don't often vote even if they don't like the president".
Prior to Ford's public testimony, which indicated he was accused of sexual assault, analysts predicted a sharp reaction if the Republicans rushed to confirm the nomination to the Supreme Court.
Earlier this week, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said the election was "a very confusing one for the Republican Party", NBC News reported.
As the director of the U.S. Preference Committee, Gay Cecil, who helped the Democrats in the election, noted: "It's not just about being elected or elected to the committee, it's about putting Kavano on the bench and how they get out of this situation, what their position is".
However, after the arguments of Ford and Kavano, the Americans split into two groups, but the supporters of the hanging were more numerous.
A new YouGov poll showed that 41 percent of respondents believed or partially believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent believed or partially believed Kavano.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents believed Kavano was cheated in his performance, and 30 percent thought so of Ford.
Flake's pressures have led to the FBI investigating another witness of Kavano's victim, Deborah Ramirez, who was also a witness to the shooting, reports The Gardian.
Last week, Kavano testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee that he had jumped Ford when he was 17 years old while drinking.
During her time at Yale University in the 1980s, a Supreme Court nominee showed off her genitals at a party.
World Wide Web developer plans to create a new Internet that will rival Google and Facebook
The inventor of the world wide web, computer genius Tim Berners-Lee, launched a new startup that rivals Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The project, built on the Solid platform with open source code from Berners-Lee, is called Inrupt.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored, to whom it will be disclosed, or to provide information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was world domination.
We have to do it now, he said of the startup.
This is a historical moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal online data.
It contains a contact list, a work list, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools for work.
Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all in one browser and all are similar to a single shelter.
The uniqueness of online personal data storage is that the user can choose what information to access.
The company calls this personal empowerment through information.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company provides the resources, processes, and skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of a security platform purchased from Berner-Lee, Bruce, IBM, several state-of-the-art developers hired to work on the project, and an organization of freelance programmers.
Starting this week, developers around the world will be able to use their centralized applications, tools available on the Inrupt website.
According to Berners-Lee, he and his team do not intend to consult with Facebook and Google to consider a complete change in business model.
We do not ask them for permission.
On Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote on his Medium portal: Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems, and to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.
The Internet was created in 1994 when the World Wide Web Consortium was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a key role in the debate over net neutrality.
Despite having launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the Open Information Institute, the World Internet Networks Consortium, an international non-profit organization.
"I remain optimistic about the future of the internet", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: A Victorian World War I worshipper gained fame
100 years later, the only clergyman in the Anglican Church to be awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry in the First World War.
On 29 September 1918, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the attack on the communes of Leocure and Belanglais.
However, he was unaware that he had received the highest military award of Great Britain, as he was killed by a sniper 4 days later.
A memorial tombstone was erected in her honour at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday, in the presence of her grandchildren.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the plaque was "significant" because it was erected 100 years after his grandfather's heroism.
The London Gazette reported that on 29 September 1918, under-colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Canten under heavy fog, heavy artillery and gunfire.
He then reached the firing line and led the line forward with great courage, destroying three of the detachment alone.
On October 4, 1918, a month before the end of the war, the German sniper killed Podpolkovnik Vann.
Michael Vann, 72, said he could never have duplicated his grandfather's courage.
After the parade of the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brentwood, he and his brother Dr. James Vann laid flowers in the grounds of their grandfather's home.
It is a great pleasure for us to be part of the parade, because the display of the true hero's heroism was held with the support of many people", said James Vann.
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Svinka Pepppa.
Imagine that you have been up all night watching the Bellator 206 tournament, but you have been denied entry.
The schedule of the tournament in San Jose featured 13 matches, six of which were shown overnight on the main map on 5 UK channels.
At 6 p.m., as Gegard Musaci and Rory MacDonald prepared for a face-to-face meeting, the replacement of the reportage with Svinka Peppa shocked the British audience.
For some, this was of no consequence, as they were awake to watch the battle.
A fan called the adaptation of the show into a children's animated series "some kind of crazy joke" on her Twitter.
Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said: "In accordance with the government's position, at 6 a.m. this content was not worthy of its content, so we had to move it to a children's program", when asked about the show.
Yes, this is Svinka Pepp.
Scott Kokker, president of Bellator, said they would work on their knees to ensure that UK viewers could watch the tournament in the future.
I think we'll think about repeating the broadcast and work on it, " said Koker.
Now in the UK, Sundays are at six in the morning and we can't decide on our time until Sunday, because they have Mondays.
But, we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast started, we thought about technical flaws and tried to fix them, there were a lot of messages from both sides, and they were not friendly.
We thought about technical flaws and tried to correct them.
But this did not happen, and all questions were put to the government.
Otherwise, he promised that it would not happen again.
This time we increased the number of fights from five to six for fans and saved time - there will be five fights in the future as usual.
This is a regrettable situation.
Desert Island Discs reports that Tom Daley felt sexually attractive
Olympic champion Tom Daley was a young man who felt sexually attractive, but this was to strengthen his strength to win.
"I didn't realize that not all people are like me until I went to middle school", the 24-year-old said.
In an interview with Lorene Laverne, the host of the Desert Island Discs radio program on Radio 4, she spoke out in support of gay rights to inspire hope in others.
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympic Games by becoming the head of the family.
The longtime regular host of the show, Christie Young, took a few months off due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, she felt inferior to others because it was unacceptable to be like boys and girls at the same time", said Daley.
She said: "To this day, I still feel worse and different than others and it gave me strength and energy to succeed".
According to her, she wanted to prove herself as a person so that people would not change their perception of her by knowing her sexual orientation.
At the Commonwealth Olympic Games in Australia this year, the two-time bronze medalist, a member of the LGBT campaign, called on other countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He explained his courage by his ability to live openly and by the fact that he had a sense of hope in others.
"My love for the American director Dustin Lens Black, whom I met in 2013, started unexpectedly", the three-time world champion said.
Daley married a 20-year-old Oscar winner last year - she says the age difference has never been a problem for her.
He went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer 3 years later - he said it was hard to find people of the same age who had risen and fallen and gone through so much despite being young.
In June, Robert Ray wrote to Black-Daily: "My whole worldview has changed".
If you asked me last year, I would have said that I should have won the gold medal".
But you know what? There are things in the world that are more important than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbi.
His son Robert is named after his grandfather, who died of a brain tumor in 2011 at the age of 40.
"My father couldn't accept that he was going to die and one of the questions he had was whether he had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row", said Daley.
"I couldn't tell you that you couldn't sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
I held her hand up to my chin and when she stopped taking a penny, I thought she was a fine person until she died.
In her second year, Daley won bronze at the 2012 Olympic Games.
I knew that swimming at the Olympic Games in front of my people was my lifelong dream, she said.
Also, the song Proud by Heather Smalls inspired her during her preparation for the Olympic Games and still caresses her body today.
Desert Island Discs is a radio show on BBC Radio 4 at 11h15 British Summer Time.
The game of the Ryder Cup is very slow
In his game Sunday in the 47th Ryder Cup, American Phil Mickelson will set his own record, but he needs to get back in shape to make sure the record is not a disaster.
After competing for the 12th time in two years, Mickelson was replaced by captain Jim Furick on Saturday in the forse and forball games.
The five-time winner, who was in the center of the US events, spent half the day sitting on the fans' stand and the rest of the day working on the game that was bothering him on the field.
The 48-year-old athlete was not at his best when he was at the beginning of his career and the unevenly-packed narrow field of Le Golf National was not very favorable for him and he punished the player for his mistakes.
Although the golf course was not a threat in Sunday's game 9, this week Mikelson will play against Open Championship champion Francesco Momenari, a veteran British player who is set to win all four games, teamed with newcomer Tommy Flitwood.
If the Americans, who were trailing by 4 points in the last 12 games, get a hot start, the game could be tense for Mikeelson.
Furik expressed his confidence in his companion, which was all he could say about him.
He understood his role in the game he played today, and he touched my back and hugged me and said he was ready for the game tomorrow", Furik said.
U has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a member of the  Hall of Fame and has worked for this team before and this week.
I didn't know he had played two matches.
I tried to show myself that we should go the way we thought we should go and that's what happened.
He wants to be where everyone else is.
On Sunday, Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
This may mark the end of his Ryder Cup career, as he never broke a personal record.
Mikelson had 18 wins and 20 losses in 7 tails, but Furique felt differently about his presence in the team.
"He's a very talkative, hot-tempered, spiky guy who likes to make people laugh and he's a very good guy in the team", he explained.
I think the young players were uplifted during the week he played with them.
It offers more than a simple game.
Thomas Bjorn , captain of the European team , knows that his big advantage may be gone
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European teams, knew from experience that the final day of the single-discipline Ryder Cup could turn into a heated race.
In his first match in 1997, Valderram, led by his teammate Sev Ballesteros, won by the smallest margin, 141⁄2-131⁄2 points, five points ahead of the Americans.
"You always remember the big advantage in Valderram: our advantage was when we lost in Brooklyn and when we won in Valderram, the advantage is nine", Bjorn said after looking at the results of the game with 5:3 on Friday 2018 and 10:6 on Golf National golf club tonight.
"So, for me and for all of this team, history will show that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will do even better.
Go there and do it right.
It won't end until you've scored points.
Our goal is to try to win and that is what we are focused on.
I've focused on 12 games that we've played and we know that we have the best players on earth against us", I said.
Bjorn added, always excited about how golfers play on a hard golf course: "I would never rush ahead of time".
Tomorrow, there will be a competition with another person.
Tomorrow there will be separate competitions, and that is another matter.
It's nice to be with a partner when the game is going well, but when you're playing alone, you're testing your skills as a golfer.
We have to tell the players that we are going to put all our efforts into tomorrow's game.
Tomorrow, you have to forget about putting all your energy into the game and give it 100 percent.
His teammate Jim Fury would have a better performance in individual events than Bjorn, except for Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
On the final day, Furiq himself was at the forefront of both of these changes; after performing the Medina miracle as the representative of the winning team in Brooklyn and the loser of the European national team.
Captain Ben Krenshow of 1999 said, "I know every word that's going to be said", when asked about his team before the final race.
We have 12 important games tomorrow and you want to start as fast as you did in Brooklyn and Medina.
This force was a major pressure on the match as it was going one way in the middle of the tournament.
We have tried to prepare the team, thanks to your gift, to perform miracles tomorrow in an orderly manner.
Thomas was given the lead in the attack and was assigned to stand and play against Rory Mackilroy in the top match against Paul Casey, Dustin Rose, John Ram, Tom Flitwood and Jan Poulter and other Europeans in the top half of the game.
After his own choices, Bjorn said: "The reason I behaved this way with this group of guys is, I think, because I was so attracted to them".
New German warship delayed again
According to local media reports, the new German Harbi-Marine Fleet frigate was supposed to be introduced in 2014 to replace the old Cold War war warships, but due to the poor state of the systems and the rapid rise in prices, it was resurrected this evening.
According to the newspaper Die Zeif, the commissioning of the new forward-deployed frigate Reypland-Pfaalz, like the Baiden-Württemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be delivered to the Navy in 2014, but problems with the supply of the products prevented the ambitious project.
The four ships of the class Baden-Württemberg were ordered by the Navy in 2007 to replace the older frigates of the class Breemen.
According to calculations, they are equipped with powerful gun, anti-ship and anti-aircraft missile sets, as well as low radar, optical and infrared surveillance technologies.
Other important features of the new frigates included the fact that the longer maintenance was to be sent two years further from their port bases.
However, as Die Zelt noted, the constant delays suggest that these advanced warships, in addition to demonstrating Germany's power among other countries, would be obsolete by the time of armed force.
Last year, the German Navy officially refused to commission the F125 and returned it to the shipyard, where it was repaired and built by the Hamburg-based Blohm & Voss shipyard, the newspaper headlines said.
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a shipbuilder.
The reasons for the return of the ship were not disclosed, but the German mass media pointed out the "program and hardware flaws" of the ships, and believed that they were useless in the performance of their combat mission.
The lack of a supply program was particularly important, as the crew of the Baiden Vürtemberg was to consist of about 120 sailors, which was only half the personal strength of the earlier Breemen class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was overweight, which reduced its performance and therefore delayed the future modernization of the Navy.
The 7,000-tonne Reynland-Pfaalts were twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the poor condition of the equipment, the project was also very expensive, taking into account the training of the crew.
The price was incredibly high: the initial price was €2.2 billion, but the current price has reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems with the new frigates were particularly important because of recent warnings about the decline of the German Navy.
Earlier this year, the parliamentary commissioner for military forces, Hans-Peters-Bartels, admitted that the Navy's reserve fleet of ships, which was actually equipped for expansion (dislocation), was running out.
According to the official, the problem was aggravated over time, as the old ships that had gone out of service were replaced by new ones.
He was disappointed that not a single frigate of the Baden-Württemberg class had joined the fleet.
National Foundation of Russia studies the underground life of frogs
The search for the hilltop in Scotland was aimed at determining how the frogs used the ladshaft in their hunting.
We hope that the obtained data will introduce new insights into the study of the life of rare and rare mammals and help in nature conservation activities.
The research, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will include a large dwarf frog, a small adult frog, a long-eared gray frog, and the devil butterfly Dabonton, which is in the Interview Gardens in Wester-Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at important locations around the hotel to monitor the frogs' existence throughout the season.
Also, staff and volunteers of the SMF will conduct mobile research using portable detectors.
The recording and analysis of the sounds of frogs can be used to identify the frequencies and types of sounds.
The map and report will then be made, identifying the places of residence, and the landscape will be explored in detail to create a picture of their lives.
Rob Dyuar, a nature conservation advisor at the SMF, is the author of this study on what areas are harvested, and how each area uses its own habitat.
This information will help in habitat management, in the processing of wetlands, and in determining how frogs are related to forest protection and other species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the population of frogs has declined over the past 100 years.
They are threatened by construction and technological activities, which prevent them from adapting to their living conditions.
Wind and lighting equipment, such as adhesive tape for mosquitoes, chemically treated building materials, and domestic cats are also hazardous.
The lizards are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, ears are more useful than eyes when hunting.
They use sophisticated technical echolocation to avoid obstacles on their way.
The country is seriously caring for the responsible frogs of the ShMF, which have 270 historic houses, 38 important gardens and 76000 hectares of land.
There are 10 trained specialists who regularly conduct examinations and help with the overnight care.
The organisation has even established the only specialized frog reserve in Scotland, with 8 of the 10 species living on the David Topson property in Trev County.
According to area director David Thompson, the area is a good place for frogs.
"This place, Trev, is good for frogs", he said.
Here are old houses, many perennial trees, and good living conditions.
But there are many unknown facts about frogs, so we need to understand what is needed for populations here and elsewhere.
He emphasized the importance of testing for frogs before serving on the property, as the destruction of one nest could kill 400 female and young frogs, and wipe out the entire local population.
The birds are protected by law, so every safety, killing, survival, nesting, and destruction is checked.
The Foundation's activist in Scotland, Elisabeth Ferrell, has called for help to protect the frogs.
He said: "We know about frogs and we don't know about their population in life".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers intend to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news" and said that people were going to be famous because of his name.
His lawyers were going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to reports, Ronaldo paid the woman $375,000 in 2010 to keep her quiet about what happened.
A few hours after the claim was published, Ronaldo, 33, called it a "fake news" in front of 142 million followers on Instagram.
No-no-no-no. This is a very good idea.
What they're saying today is a lie", the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
They want glory for my name's sake.
This is a common occurrence.
Such situations are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine in everything".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are going to sue Der Spiegel for "disturbing news about his personal life".
According to lawyer Christian Shertz, the footballer was accused of violating his personal rights and demanded compensation based on the degree of moral harm, which was probably the most serious violation of his rights in recent years.
The incident is believed to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palms casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to his room and, according to documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada, he allegedly raped Majorga.
According to the girl, after the rape, Ronaldo fell on his knees and said: "I am 99% a good guy, but I was cheated 1%".
According to documents, they slept together, but Ronaldo claimed that it was consensual.
According to the mayor, he contacted the police and photographed his wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement for fear of public humiliation.
The 34-year-old woman said she now wants to cancel the deal because she still cannot get over the trauma.
After the invention of the attack on Ronaldo, he was one step away from moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: Britain will regret it forever for car production
The UK would "always regret" losing its status as the world's leading automobile manufacturer, said Gregg Clark, post-Brexit minister for business and entrepreneurship.
According to a BBC report, the official leadership of Toyotá said that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would stop Bernaston near Derby - a news that had the minister in mind.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker has warned that a no-deal Brexit would lead to job losses due to delays at the border.
The Bernaston plant, which produced about 150000 cars, exported 90% of Toyota's Auris and Avensis brands to other European Union countries during the past year.
"If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop", said Martin Cook, director of Toyota in Bernaston.
UK carmakers such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover were concerned about leaving the EU if they did not agree on how the car trade would work.
For example, BMW announced that it would close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month.
The biggest risk to the automobile industry is the UK's exit from the EU without a deal.
Toyota's production line operates as a full-time , with spare parts for cars produced on order coming from UK manufacturers every 37 minutes, as well as from the European Union.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement by 29 March, there could be disruptions along the border, which industry officials fear could lead to delays and parts shortages.
Toyota said that the Derbicher plant would not be able to hold spare parts for more than a day, and production would be halted.
The Checkers plan, developed by Theresa May, is to prevent such investigations at the boundary of what is considered a reasonable future relationship with the European Union", Mr. Clark said.
We need a deal, - said Mr. Clark. <seg id="15" Translator-id='User 03'>We want such a good deal, the joy of today's success, beyond the possibilities of a deal, - said to BBC Radio 4 in the program Today.
We need to continue to do as much good work as possible, as Toyota and other manufacturers have said.
Toyota warned that he could not say how long production would be halted, adding that additional losses would reduce the competitiveness of the plant in the near term and would eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsувалларис, union leader of Unite, worked at the Bernaston plant for 24 years, and his collective is deeply saddened: "I can tell you from experience that if jobs are cut, there will be none".
According to the government representative, We have a clear and solid plan for our future relations with the European Union.
White House warns Trump and Rosenstein may be postponed
The White House said Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on Sunday could be "postponed for another week" as the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano continues.
Rozenstein, special adviser to Robert Müller, was leading an investigation into Russian interference in the election; contacts between Trump and Russian aides were linked to potential presidential objections to the judiciary.
Rumors circulated for months in Washington that Trump would fire the deputy attorney general and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was recording conversations with Trump and discussing the possibility of a 25th Amendment.
Rozenstein denied the report.
On Monday, he traveled to the White House to announce his intention to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday at the UN in New York.
Trump favored not firing Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed due to a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing to avoid a vote, with Brett Kavano and his sexual harassment accuser, Christine Blaysey Ford, testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavano, which delayed the Senate vote for a longer period.
On Monday, Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders gave an interview to the Fox News news program.
To a question about a meeting with Rozenstein, he said, "They haven't set a date yet, maybe this week, I think they might postpone it for another week because of other things going on at the Supreme Court".
See, I like to keep the press on course.
Some reporters have denied this claim: Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked why it was not held.
Sanders: I wouldn't call the lack of a briefing a "spooky" look at the tele-reporters to show them off, but I don't deny the fact that they showed themselves.
Trump did not rule out an increase in face-to-face meetings with the press.
"The president has more question-and-answer sessions than any other president", he said, without saying anything to substantiate: "We looked at those numbers".
Sanders said the briefing would be held as usual, but if matbughata is willing to ask the president of the United States a direct question, it would be much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it, and you've seen us do it a lot in the past week, and a conversation with the president of the United States is a press briefing.
Trump has always answered questions not only at public meetings in the White House, but also at press conferences before high-ranking guests.
There are few solitary press conferences.
He explained that he had been very open and unusual in his appearance to reporters in New York this week.
Scottish Health Minister writes to EU official, Scottish police health workers about concerns over Brexit
The Scottish Minister of Health expressed the country's and the Scottish police's gratitude to the EU officer, health workers and called on them to continue their work after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter six months before the UK's exit from the EU.
The Scottish Government has undertaken to cover the costs of applying for EU immigrant status for citizens working in the autonomous public service.
In her letter, Ms. Friedman wrote: "We have been negotiating with the UK for the summer on the issue of leaving the EU and the decision we were expecting was taken in the autumn.
But the United Kingdom also accelerated work on the possibility of a no-deal exit.
I know this is a very difficult time for all of us.
I would like to say that we respect every worker, regardless of his nationality.
Our partners in the EU and beyond have a wealth of experience that improves the work of healthcare professionals and provides a tremendous support to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland  is your home and we definitely want you to stay with us.
Christion Aberkrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
The loss of the halfback of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Aberkrombi, who underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after suffering a head injury in a game against the Vanderbilts Commodores, ended with a score of 31:27, - reports Mike Organ, a sports journalist from Tennessee.
Tennessee's head coach, Rod Reed, said the injury was taken before the break.
"The line fell when it reached the ridge", said Reed.
The coaches and doctors gave Aberkrombi oxygen before putting him in a stretcher and then taking him away for examination.
A spokesperson for the Tennessee State Department told the state's WSMV channel that Harris was being released from surgery at the Abercromby Vanderbilt Medical Center.
"We don't have any information yet on the type/size of injury", Harris added, adding that Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury income was due.
A second-year student, Aberkromby spent his first season in Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he attempted to get the ball five times before the break, resulting in 18 repeats of the same maneuver in the season.
New emblem for foreign buyers of real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will be charged an additional heraldic tax when they buy property in the UK; according to new plans by the Tory political party, the money will go to a homeless assistance programme.
The move was intended to frustrate Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn's attempt to attract younger voters.
The additional heraldic tax will be raised for non-taxpayers in the UK.
The UK Ministry of Finance expects it will raise £120 million a year for the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged an additional heraldic tax when they buy property in the UK - the money will go to the homeless support programme, Theresa May announced today.
This move was seen as a way to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's success by promising young voters affordable housing and counting on high-income people.
The heraldic tax would be collected from individuals and firms in the UK who did not pay the tax, and the additional money prompted the government to create a programme of affordable housing for the homeless.
Additionally, the new heraldic tax on the purchase and lease of second homes was introduced two years ago, and was 3% in total.
The UK Ministry of Finance hopes to collect £120 million a year in taxes.
It is estimated that 13% of newly built homes in London are bought by UK foreigners, and the rising prices prevent others from buying.
Due to foreign buyers, many of the country's affluent areas, especially in the capital, were called "hearts-cities", as they spent much of their time outside the country.
The new policy came a week after Boris Johnson's call for a new herald tax cut to help many young people buy their own homes.
In an appeal to correct Britain's property shame, May urged Mrs. May to abandon the quota for cheap property and accused the big construction firms of buying land but not using it, which was why the khans did not take it down.
Mr. Corbin's new housing reforms included paying rent and evicting innocent residents.
His wish was to give the local authorities the power to build new houses.
Mrs. May: "I said last year that I would devote my time as prime minister to reviving the British dream and improving the quality of life for the next generation".
This is called housing market reform.
The United Kingdom will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, this did not apply to British foreigners who did not live in Britain but bought a cheap house and worked.
For many people, the dream of having their own home is a reality, but the problem of sleeping in the open air is very remote.
"My ultimate goal is to govern Scotland", said Jack Ross.
Jack Ross, manager of Sunderland F.C., has a dream of one day governing Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scot, who finished third in the Premier League with a three-point lead, was delighted to be working on the rebuilding of the Northeast.
He moved to the Stade de la Lumière this year after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Premier League last season.
BBC-Scotland Radio Scotland Sportsound has been added to the programme:
I wanted to be a player for my country".
When I was a kid, I always watched Scotland games with my dad at Hampden Stadium and he always attracted me to him.
But that will only happen if I have a great success in managing the club.
Sunderland's previous managers before Ross included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Ellardays, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poyet and Paulo Di Kanyo.
"After rejecting previous offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town and coming after such influential people as a manager of a major Scottish football club, I was never afraid", said future Scottish football club manager Alloah Athletic Ross.
Can I get this club back to the Premier League?
It has a place in the Premier League because of its construction and possibilities", he said.
It is not an easy task to achieve this, but I will consider myself successful only if I have brought the club back there.
Ross spent his managerial career as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as head coach at Hearts, but only 3 years.
He then helped Alloa to a third-place finish and lifted Sent-Mirren from the relegation zone to the title champion the following season.
I feel more comfortable than I did when I was in the climbs of Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academica", said Ross.
It was probably a very trying time", he recalled, taking responsibility for Alloá.
I was convinced that management was more my thing than the game.
It sounds strange, because I was fine, I was doing well and I was sorry.
But playing is complicated.
You have to deal with many things every day.
I still go through stress and pressure, but management makes me feel good.
I have always wanted to be a slave; now that I am a slave, I am in a position to be in any way.
You can listen to Jack Ross's full performance on Sunday 30 September from 12.00 to 13.00 in the Sportsound show on BBC Radio Scotland.
The best time to drink beer is Saturday at 17:30
The financial crisis led to a rise in the revenues of British pubs, but a major push was made on restaurant chains.
Statistics show that sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurants decreased by 4.8%.
According to sales company CGA's calculations, Peter Martin: Due to England's long participation in the World Cup and the prolonged heat of the summer months, July followed the pattern of June: pubs saw a 2.8% increase in revenue, while restaurants suffered the most.
The decline of 1.8% in sales in June only intensified in July.
Other inedible pubs have the same disadvantage as restaurant revenues.
Food and pubs were also affected by the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
The people were just thirsty for water.
Sales of alcohol in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, while food sales increased by only 3%.
Paul Newman, an analyst at the cultural-recreational and hotel company RSM, said: "We're seeing this take shape as early as April.
When it comes to the external market, the weather, social and sports news remain the main conditions.
Despite the difficulty of a 4.8% drop in sales revenue over the previous year, most restaurants are trying to keep up and continue to struggle alongside cost cuts.
The long hot summer was a difficult time for companies specializing in food, and only time will tell if the mild weather we experienced in August will bring relief.
The increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, along with new owners, was 2.7% in July and showed a gradual market launch of brands.
The control of the Coffer Peach Tracker is exemplified by the collection and analysis of £9 billion in revenue from 47 working groups for British pubs, bars and restaurants.
Every fifth child has a secret social media account that they keep from their parents
According to the survey, every fifth child, some as young as 11, has a hidden social media account from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
This new development highlighted the danger of a proliferation of sexual-themed writings.
20% of students were able to share their main accounts with their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11, have accounts on social media that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts.
This new development highlighted the danger of a proliferation of sexual-themed writings.
20% of students were able to share their main accounts with their parents, with censorship, and a more private and non-sensitive account.
A mother read on a mysterious website that her 13-year-old daughter was encouraging others to rape her.
According to a study by the Center for Digital Awareness Research and the Conference of Private School Directors, 40% of students ages 11 to 18 said they had two accounts and half said they had a private account.
Mike Bykenen, head of the KD private school, said: "Many teenagers are online and parents and teachers can't find them because of the online space".
Eid Doyle will be the voice of the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Council
British athlete Eylid Doyle was elected as a volunteer director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the annual meeting of the governing body.
The move by Scotland's most prestigious athlete, Doyle, was a step that, according to the head of the board, Jen Beatty, gives the sport's managers the opportunity to use the experience of the last decade of the athlete.
"Eilid is highly respected in the athletics organisations in Scotland, Britain and all over the world, and we believe it would be a great benefit if she were to join the Director's Association of Scottish Athletics", said Bittie.
"I want to be the voice of the athletes and help lead Scottish sport and make my contribution", said Doyle.
Her American partner, a four-time Olympic Games champion runner who won the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, was left quadriplegic after a micro-stroke, and is now a regular specialist for Би-би-си.
"A month ago I had a stroke", he wrote on Twitter.
I couldn't walk.
My doctors said that time would tell if I would survive.
It was a very hard job, but she recovered completely, learned to walk again, and is exercising today!
Thank you for your encouraging words.
Russia has been a voice for ads comparing mammals to cows
The company that produces the milking equipment also agreed with the public opinion that the comparison of nursing mothers with dairy cows in advertising should be made.
The technology consumer company Elvie has released a humorous video-presentation called the world's first silent breast lift, which aims to make life easier for nursing mothers.
In a hay-covered cowshed, four mothers dance to the tune of a song that says: "Yes, I am well, but you do not see my vomit. And if you do not see it, it is not the cow's belly, but my dream".
The application continues: Shurry, shurry, I feed the children, shurry, shurry, I nurse my wives.
However, the ad, which was posted on the Facebook page of the company, sparked controversy in the network.
This aroused a disagreement among the 77,000 viewers and hundreds of comments from the recorded audience, many of whom expressed a lack of appreciation for the concerns of the dairy industry.
One user said it was "too risky" to advertise pigs on this app.
They need to get pregnant and give birth to milk like us, but the difference is that when they give birth, they are stolen.
The name Elvie/Mother, which is a suckling insect that sucks milk, was placed on the breastplate.
The other explained: "This is obviously a blow to both mother and child".
Yes, what's wrong with using them in advertising?
Another added: "It's advertising that's far from real".
Others supported the advertisement, and one woman - a song - seemed happy for her".
I think it's a great idea.
If I were breastfeeding, I would buy such a suction cup.
I felt like a cow when I was milking.
The advertisement was a bit of a dream, but I accepted it as it was.
This is a brilliant king", one wrote.
Second comment: This is a ridiculous ad for mothers who are nursing in the bathroom or at work and feel "cool".
This is not a promotion that praises or denigrates the dairy industry .
At the end of the song, the women dance with a milk jug in a collection of chestnuts.
The concept of the campaign is based on the fact that most women feel like cows because of their breastfeeding.
However, the Elvie device is silent, wireless and tubeless, is inserted into breast-feeding bras in an unobtrusive manner, and allows the mother to carry her babies outdoors when they are sick.
According to Ana Balarin, director and partner of the advertising agency Mother, Elvie is a revolutionary product, and it deserves to be sent based on boldness and temptation.
Comparing the healing of the cow and the cow we showed the problems of healing and the sensation of freedom of the new pump in a fascinating and interesting way.
This is not the first time that a milkmaid has been featured on the front page of a newspaper.
At the London Fashion Week, a mother of two walked onto the podium of designer Martha Yakubovsky with a milk cooler.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly placed in a tent camp on the border with Tehran
The number of detained migrant children increased dramatically, but the number of border crossings did not change in a month, due to the Trump administration's announcement and measures that have made it difficult for adoptive parents to take the children in.
Most of the adoptees were once illegal immigrants themselves, so those who claimed children's rights risked not staying in the country.
The threat came in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members would be required to take fingerprints and be sent to immigration authorities.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albenz arrested dozens of people who had filed a petition to the agency before Congress to have them placed under child custody.
The agency later found that 70% of those arrested had not been convicted.
 Up to 80% of people, sponsors and sponsoring family members, live in this country illegally and most are foreigners.
Therefore we persecute them".
In order to process children more quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, some of which, according to the shelter workers, required them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, not 60 days.
They can also appear in an immigration court to defend their legal status via videoconference, rather than in person.
Those who refuse to cooperate will be immediately expelled from the country.
According to the workers of the shelter, the long-term detention of children who arrived in the last month increases the risk of childhood restlessness, escape, violence.
Advocates say this risk is more common in large institutions like Tornilio, where the large camp area poses a risk to children.
If you move children without emotionally preparing them, they will suffer psychologically if they do not say goodbye to their friends", they added.
Syria calls on the US, France and Turkey to withdraw the occupying forces immediately
Despite eight years of war, the UN Secretary General's Foreign Affairs Minister Walid al-Muğalllim called on Syrian refugees to return home.
The deputy prime minister, Mugalim, said that foreign troops were living illegally in Syria under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that appropriate measures would be taken against them.
They should leave the country without any conditions", he told the assembly.
The war in Syria, which killed 360,000 people and displaced millions in 2011, is over".
He said Damascus is continuing this holy war, liberating the territory of Syria from terrorist groups and illegal aliens", Mugalim said.
The United States also maintains about 2,000 armed forces in Syria, training and advising them; in general, the US has been pushing both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
The war-torn country had over 1000 armed forces under French control.
"The conditions are good for the refugees to return", said Mughallim, who accused some Western countries of spreading "irrational fear" that encouraged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to support their return", he said.
"They politicize a purely humanitarian issue".
"No support for the reconstruction of Syria will be provided without a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on the cessation of hostilities", the United States and the European Union warned.
Diplomats from the United Nations said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last Idlib uprising provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province of three million people.
However, Mughallim noted that the terms of the agreement were clear; it offered hope that the war would be stopped by the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which was affiliated with Al Qaeda.
The United Nations representative Staffan de Mistoura hopes to soon draft a post-war Syrian constitution and organize the first meetings of a new committee composed of representatives of the government and opposition that would be conducive to elections.
The Muğalim stated that the work of the committee should be limited to the consideration of the articles of the current constitution, and added to the press conference the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election, as most liberal viewers hope, unless his presidential term expires early due to impeachment or controversy.
This is without a doubt the most dramatic presidential finale in history!
At present, there are no signs of fatigue in the hummus.
Since 2014, the prime-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers on CNN, while the ratings have tripled to 1.6 million viewers on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News was watched by 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and now has 2.4 million viewers during prime-time. The first spot is held by the evening news of MSNBC, with 3.5 million viewers.
"These people are a smokeless fire, we won't understand it", said Niel Baer, showrunner of the ABC drama The Last Candidate about the cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol collapse.
The author of the book Just Happy Seasons: and a Few Facts About How to Get Into the Hollywood Boys Club, Neill Showell, a veteran of comedy scripts, has a different theory.
He recalled sitting in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver informed him that he had chosen Trump.
"Why?" the woman asked.
"Because it's interesting", the driver replied, as Mrs. Showell said.
Chaos opens people's hearts.
Certainly, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Row Wade, the reunification of immigrant families, and the health of the world economy.
Only the most superficial spectators could have the luxury of being turned off.
However, it's not just about being informed citizens, because sometimes at 6 p.m. you find yourself sitting in a group of experts discussing the use of the "Fear" in Bob W. Woodward's book, watching the results of Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich skin bomb (a suit full of dirt - The Washington Post called it that) and Sturm Daniels' black-and-white depiction of Trump's anatomy.
I will never be able to look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
"Part of his job is to show you everything like a reality show, to give you food for thought until the evening", said Wheelhouse Entertainment's CEO and author of The Stars of Lomabrd, Brent Montgomerie, about the daily cast changes and plot twists of the Trump show (fighting the NFL, praise of Kim Jong-un).
You can't leave any episode behind.
When Mr. Fliss visited him this week, it was 27 °C outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He was not to be separated: at this time, Brett Kavano was to meet face-to-face with the Senate Judiciary Committee to determine the future of the Supreme Court, which was on the ropes.
I remember how we were doing these crazy shows at the time, and Mr. Fliss said to me, "This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization".
I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be true.

Foreign currency enters the toughest midterm election fight
It is not surprising that the 17th District of Pennsylvania saw a cash flow due to the grouping of congressional districts and therefore two presidents competed for the same seat.
The newly renovated suburb of Pittsburgh is home to Republican Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the election last spring.
Currently, Lamb is running against Republican incumbent Kit Rottfus, the representative from the old 12th District, which is similar to the new 17th Pennsylvania District.
The maps were removed when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old regions had been unconstitutionally changed in favor of the Republicans.
The contest for the new 17th Congressional District involved a funding battle between the Democratic Electoral Committee and the National Republican Electoral Committee, the major financial parties.
Lamb's name became famous after winning a special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump has won the region by 20 points.
Political experts preferred the Democrats.
The United States fined El Salvador for aiding China, but later withdrew.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, while Washington opposed it.
In June 2017, Trump met with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella and stayed at the Panama Hotel for a short time before the partners transferred the leadership of the Trump Organization.
"In response to recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", State Department officials said earlier this month, "the United States has recalled American diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama".
Perhaps the fines were in El Salvador's favor: El Salvador received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, including for drug research, development and economic aid.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be too heavy for Central America and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
During internal meetings, officials from North America and Central America postponed a high-profile meeting devoted to security and economic growth to continue the previous meeting that had discussed ways to reduce the number of migrants coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, officials of the highest administration indicated their willingness to continue the conference, thus concluding the investigation into the imposition of fines for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence was keen to speak at a conference in mid-October to show the importance of the administration.
Then, without bad news or punishment from Washington, the three American representatives set off for El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic.
Mr. Bolton's White House representative declined to provide details of the debate, and three American officials, including two diplomats, agreed to speak anonymously about internal disputes.
Their statements were confirmed by a pro-government analyst who remained anonymous.
History reading
The second trick may have been the report by lawyer Robert Müller about Mr. Trump's obstruction of justice, which is currently abundantly documented in public records.
According to reports, Müller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign has conspired with Russia to attack our election.
If Congress changes its ownership, Trump will answer to this body as if he were prepared to meet with voters, and, ultimately, to appear before a jury of his peers.
There are many, if not many, but I'm not talking about Mr. Trump's losing his job and his European equivalents.
We're going to have to make choices that will affect the duration of the fight on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to overthrow the Czechoslovak government if the West supported it in its resistance to Hitler.
We lost and missed the opportunity to avoid the terrible massacre that would continue for years to come.
History repeats these turns: The endless march of democracy accelerates or slows.
The American people are facing such a turn of events.
What will we do if Trump expels Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the head of the Mueller investigation?
The newspaper reported that Rozenstein had been harassed last year after suggesting that the president be secretly recorded and suggesting that he was unfit for office.
The Times' story is not true", said Rozenstein.
"If the investigation of Brett Kavano, as requested by the new Federal Bureau of Investigation, is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed by the Supreme Court despite rape and false testimony, how do we respond?
And first, in a midterm election, do we vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we don't pass this test, democracy will have a long winter ahead of us.
But I am confident that we will win, because I learned a lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had occupied my embassy.
She survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, on Shabbat, she sent me to light a candle on a table with a swastika symbol.
With this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

"Rangers" player Graham Dorrans greeted the match with cheer
Earlier this month, the Rangers finished with a base score against Villarreal in Spain, and now, on Thursday, they are preparing to face Vienna Rapids, which will increase their chances of reaching the Europa League Group G if they beat the Austrians.
The knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance, so we only saw him in the 2-2 draw against Vilarreal, but he was confident that the Raydengers would take advantage of that success and make even greater progress.
"It's a good score for us, because Vilarreal is a strong team", the 31-year-old said.
"We started the game with the idea of doing something and we came out with a point.
We would probably have created a lot, but the final limit is a fair result.
They were stronger in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
Thursday is another major European holiday.
I am sure that we will get three points, but it will be a very difficult game, because our opponents scored high in the last game, but I am sure that with the people who support us, we will win.
When I think about my injuries and the changes that have taken place in the club, the past year has been really difficult, but I feel good about where I am now.
The team is in a good mood, they play with all their heart, they train.
I hope we can continue the past season with success".
Women lose sleep for fear of pension savings
Although respondents were well aware of the care they received, few spoke to family members about it.
Nationwide half of the participants in the study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only about 10 percent of the children are told about it.
"People want to be looked after by family members, but they don't do anything to talk about it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where you can start.
If you do not communicate your wishes, you will not prepare your family to care for you.
Work with your counselor and family members to discuss where and how to get help, as this can be a crucial factor in determining the price of your choice.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you to find a way to pay for these expenses.
The financing options for long-term care include traditional long-term care tracheal insurance policies, hybrid insurance policies to cover those costs, or voluntary insurance policies that you pay for yourself (if you have the money).
Prepare your legal documents; stay out of court cases.
Get a health care trust, so you can identify a trusted health care provider and, if you are unable to communicate, a professional can fulfill your wishes.
Make a financial trust.
You will choose a trusted person to take financial care of you and, if you are unable, pay your bills.
Remember the small details: Imagine that your elderly parents need urgent medical attention and are in the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Make sure that you have these details in writing.
"It's not just about financial performance, what about doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medications?
Who will look after the dog?

Man fires multiple rounds from pneumatic rifle in Ilfracomb
On the way home in the evening, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle.
The 40-year-old victim, Ilfracombe, was in the vicinity of Oxford Grove in Devon when he received gunshot wounds to the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting as "an extraordinary incident" at approximately 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see the shooter.
His injuries were not life-threatening, and police asked for help from witnesses.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunami
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the communication disruption, rescue workers were unable to receive any information from the Dongla district, located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Some key facts about the Palau and Donga, located on Sulawesi:
Paalu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located in a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was in the midst of a devastating earthquake and tsunami when it celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Donggala is an area of the province of Sulawesi that stretches along a coastline of over 300 km (180 mi) to the northwest of Sulawesi.
As of 2017, the administrative region of the province, the district, had a population of 299,200.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donga.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Moravail, on the opposite bank of the Sulawesi.
The Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency reports that the region has experienced several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
The 1938 tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed more than a hundred homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck west of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific seismic ring and earthquakes occur here regularly.
The following are the most powerful earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake struck the western coast of the Indonesian province of Acheh, north of Sumatra, on December 26, causing a tsunami that killed 226,000 people in 14 countries along the Indian Ocean - more than half of them Acheh residents.
2005: In late March and early April, a powerful earthquake struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake in southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, killed about 700 people and caused a tsunami along the southern coast.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentavai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of more than 10 meters in length, destroying dozens of villages and taking about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake in the Acheche district of Pidija caused devastation and panic as people recalled the terrible aftermath of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the destroyed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in a difficult situation.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was imprisoned for domestic abuse
Track Payn, the eldest son of Alaska's governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Payn, was a prisoner of war.
According to a report by the Alaska State Police released Saturday, 29-year-old Payn, of Уасилла, Alaska, is suspected of domestic violence, obstruction of a domestic violence report and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, the woman was trying to call the police about the crimes when she was stripped of her phone.
Payn is being held in the Mat-Su Detention Center with an unsold bond of $500, reports KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked to confess, he said he was "not guilty".
Paynlin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which could mean a year in jail and a $250,000 fine.
He is also guilty of a class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
It was not the first time that a criminal case was brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Payn, called the police and reported the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with assault on a family, obstruction of a report on domestic violence and possession of a firearm while intoxicated.
His girlfriend told him that he had hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Payn was criticized by a veteran group for linking her son's aggressive behavior due to his service in Iraq to post-traumatic stress disorder.
Indonesia earthquakes and tsunami: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in a quake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed more than a thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks were down, and the number of deaths was expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos of the season of impact are circulating on social networks.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people had gathered in the city of Palo to watch the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for suspect in New York terrorist attack
The New York Federal Prosecutor's Office is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in the murder of eight people in New York City - a rare death sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, used a rental car from Home Depot to attack a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and a cyclist.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors had to prove that Saipov "knew" to have killed eight victims and "knew" to have caused significant bodily harm, with the intent to seek the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, the death penalty is possible in both cases.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury wrote Saipov 22 charges, including eight counts of aiding and abetting murder, assault, and carjacking, which are usually used by the prosecutor in federal organized crime cases.
The prosecutor's office said the attack required "serious planning and indiscretion" and that Saipov called it "a cruel, brutal and immoral device".
"Sayfulllo Habibullayevich Saipov has caused bodily injury, injury and injury to Diego Enrique Andzelini, Nicholas Klivs, Ann-Lor Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlijs, Ernan Ferручchi, Ernan Diego Mendosa and Alejandro Damian".
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last execution in the Southern District of New York.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal New York case was in 1953 against the family of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been executed two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
In the indictment, Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack after viewing ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said he also asked to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge No. 22.
Saipov's defender, David Patton, one of the federal public defenders, said he had "openly lost hope" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We think the decision to seek the death penalty instead of a life sentence without the possibility of parole will be very difficult for those involved in these events", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team asked the prosecutor's office not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Brexit talks should be left to Nigel Farage
Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the people's army" during the protest at the Tory conference today.
The former UK leader said that politicians should "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics - because one of Theresa May's deputies suggested he talk to the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bon said at a march in Birmingham that Britain would stay out if Mr. Faraj was Secretary of State for Brexit.
However, the problem of reconciling Mrs May's deeply divided ranks was that Tory conservatives joined separate anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister struggled to implement a compromise plan for the Brexit supporters, the anti-Brexit supporters and the Chequers during the EU attacks.
The Allies said that he would try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the rejection, forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and "chaos".
Mr. Boone said in Solihull that "going means going away", telling the participants of the rally that he wanted to "go away from Chequers".
He said that he needed to level the playing field and negotiate with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would go", she said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers".
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars for obedience.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Bown rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.
Tory Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins also told reporters at the march: "I'll say this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"The chequers are not popular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for them, they are not popular among our party and activists, they are really haunting the streets and seeking our election in the first place.
Please drop the Checker and start listening.
In his address to May, he added: "The prime ministers continue to do their job when they keep their promises".
If protesting politicians want to betray the 2016 referendum resolution, they should work to "feel hot", Faraj said.
"Now we are talking about trust between the people and our political classes", he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and today we're going to tell them, 'We're not going to let you do that.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want you to feel the warmth of our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that won Brexit, and we will not rest until we have an independent, ruling and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the opposing sides passed through Birmingham, after which they held a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small minority of activists have been holding banners of Tori Anti-Brexit since the group began operating this week.
Labour's Lord Adonis criticized the Conservatives for the security problems they faced with the party's application at the opening of the conference.
"These people tell us that they have installed IT systems, that the technology that's left in Canada can be for unlimited, free trade in Ireland", he added.
It's only Persian.
There is no good Brexit", he added.
Warren is considering a presidential bid
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said after the November election that she was "thinking hard about her candidacy for president".
According to the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke on Saturday about his future in the western Massachusetts mayoral race.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Dilga, who was chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
He was at the center of rumors that he might fight Trump in 2020.
The event was held in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon, the 36th time Trump has met with mayoral voters since he took office.
A person who had attended the meeting asked him if he was considering running for president.
Warren replied: "It's time for women to come to Washington to fix our broken government, including the woman above".
Sims killer arrested
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, reported Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the murder of Louisiana State University basketball player Wade Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at a press conference held at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help in identifying the person on the video.
Simms, 20, was shot on the outskirts of the South University campus early Friday morning.
"Wade Simms was shot in the head and eventually died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports reporters on Saturday.
When Wade went to defend his friend, Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned, and it was determined that he was armed and shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East-Baton-Rudge Police Department.
The 198-cm tall youngster, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Team division helps Lewis Hamilton win the world title by beating Sebastian Fettel
When Mercedes team mate Valtteri Bottas was ordered to push Lewis Hamilton ahead in the race on Saturday, he realized that such a split would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole and defended his position in the first two turns and helped his teammate avoid Hamilton by attacking Fettel.
Fettel entered one of the boxers, leaving Hamilton in the tail of the current, which would have been the decisive moment.
Mercedes came out behind Fettel after the first lap, but Hamilton, with a slightly spinning wheel, went ahead: thus the Ferrari driver, with double speed in the third lap, did not risk defending himself, but went out.
Max Ferстапpen started from the back row of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
I then quickly crossed the finish line and led the race with my tires on for most of the race to take fourth place to Kiimi Raickkonen.
He finally entered the box on lap 44, but he was unable to increase his speed with eight laps to go as Raykkonen finished fourth.
It was a very difficult day because Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and helped me to turn in front like a real gentleman.
"The team did a great job to win first and second place", Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally for ordering her not to leave a letter from Christine Bleizi Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano of rape.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly appeal to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead explained that the events in the Senate were "evil, ruinous and deceitful".
"The only thing that could have happened and the only amazing thing that has happened in the Senate in recent days is the outrage, the people showing themselves to be evil, evil and deceitful", he said.
Based on the releases and the classified information that was circulated, they said, "Oh, I didn't do that".
I didn't do that.
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, did you distribute it?
Remember the answer... Did you leak confidential information? - Yes, what?
Aay-ay, no. It is not.
I'm not.
Wait a minute.
Were we... No, we weren't", he added, as the senator sensed.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing his allegations against Ford Kavano, and it was circulated to the public in September, but Feinstein denied leaving his office.
"I did not publicize the allegations of Dr. Ford, the incident", Feinstein told the committee, according to Ze Hill.
He asked me to keep confidential and I did so
But his refusal did not sit well with the president, who commented during a Saturday night rally: "I tell you what, that was really bad body language.
Maybe not, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen.
While three women continued to defend a Supreme Court candidate accused of ties, the president believed the Democrats were using the accusations to their advantage.
They need to regain power by various means.
Do you see their evil, their ruinousness, they have to take power and control, no matter who they make difficult, no matter who they go through?"
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5: 3 Belfast Giants with a score of 3
Patrick Duayer scored two goals in the match against Dundee Giants.
Dundee Stars recovered their elite league defeat to Belfast Giants on Friday with a 5-3 win at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with two goals to spare thanks to Patrick Duayer and his shots.
Duayer led the Giants, while Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney were relegated to the home tier.
The two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory, while François Bouchard equalized the score in favour of Dandi.
In the Elite League, Adam Kif's followers suffered three defeats before Dundee won 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams in the season, with the Giants having won three times before.
With a pass from Kendal McFol at 3:35, and a goal by David Rutherford, Duayer scored the first goal in the fourth minute, and two minutes later Bovilier doubled the lead.
In the strong opening period, Sullivan entered the game at 13:10 with Matt Markwardt giving a pass to Cooney to tie the game at 15:16.
When Duayer scored his second goal at the end of the first period, it was clear that the Giants were the first to break.
The hosts were grouped and Buchar scored 27:37, being the majority team, and again tied.
In the second period, Cooney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nielsen push Dundee forward, leading his team to a five-point victory during the final period.
The Giants, who have won four of their last five games, will play their next home game on Friday against Milton Keynes.
Aerial dispatcher sacrifices himself to save more than 100 lives in a quake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was awarded the title of hero for the safe lifting of a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing in the tsunami that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The area continued to experience strong aftershocks, and many people were unable to get out of the rubble in the city of Palo.
But despite saving the lives of his colleagues, 21-year-old Antony Guenavan refused to leave Agun Pa'u's battered dispatchers' outpost at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
He then stayed on the runway to check that Batik Air flight 6321 had flown safely.
He jumped from the dispatcher's window, sensing that the dispatcher's window was broken.
He later died in hospital.
 Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the move could save hundreds of lives, reports Australia ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter to take her from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palu this morning.
When we heard this, we were very sad".
At the same time, the government fears that the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters reports that access to Dongla, Sigui and Butung is restricted.
"The death toll continues to rise, as most of the bodies are under rubble, many are not reachable", said agency spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho.
A six-meter high wave destroyed the Palau, which will be a burial ground on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft and food aid were brought in.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings a body.
Fresh water is scarce.
Minimarket was destroyed.
Jan Geelfand, head of the Indonesian International Red Cross, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rushed to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?  CNN report.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck in Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian air disaster: One person missing after air disaster in lagoon, according to Air Niugini
The airline, which was on a flight that crashed in a Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, reported one person missing after it was informed that all 47 passengers and crew had been successfully evacuated from the sunken aircraft.
Air Niugini said the airline was unable to locate the male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local government, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger's age or nationality.
After landing at the airport on Truk Island, the plane went into the water and local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew.
Officials said seven people were hospitalized on Friday.
According to the airline, six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday, and all of them are in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the true sequence of events remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane flew off the runway.
American passenger Bill Janez reported that the plane had gone too low.
"That's very good", said Janez.
Jane's account of the incident was that the water was up to his waist, so he and others were able to get to the emergency exit points of the sunken plane.
He told of the flight crew's panic and screams and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve the sea also assisted in the rescue, before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in airline accidents in the last two decades in the PNG, but none of them were connected to Air Niugini.
Analyst shows chronology of night of burning of woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor's office based its decision on a review of the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roullet testified for several hours as an expert witness in the intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, used cellphone tapes to piece together their movements on the night of their deaths.
According to Rowlett, she had several cell phones that showed that Chambers was with Tellis on the night of his death - information that contradicts her earlier statements, reports The Clarion Ledger.
The information showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, but Tellis said he was with his friend Michael Sanford; the police decided to talk to Sanford.
Sanford said he was out of town for a performance on Saturday.
When prosecutors asked if it was true that Tellis was in Sanford's car, Sanford said, "He's lying because my car was in Nashville that night".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said she knew Chambers for about two weeks after he died.
According to the cell phone records, they had known each other for only a week.
According to Roullette, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted his messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"She wiped him out of her life", said Hale.
The defense should begin its concluding arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that the jury was expected to be in session that day.
The High Breed: What is the meaning of hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wanted to counter the negative attitude in the genre by filling their music with good news.
Bristol band The High Breed spoke about how hip-hop is moving away from the roots of political messages and listening to social issues.
They want to go back to basics and popularize conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the success of Akala and Loukie, artists like The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK.
Another black man?!
New York nanny sued her family for writing racistic text
A New York nanny was fired from her discriminatory job after receiving a text message from her mother, which read: "This is another black man".
The family rejected the racist position, comparing the trial to a "looting".
When Lindsey Plasko-Flexman, a mother of two, came to the first day of work of her new babysitter, Gisele Morris, in 2016, she was disappointed to learn that she was black.
"A MAN with a black skin" written by Linsey Plasko-Flexman to her husband.
But instead of sending the text to her husband, she sent it twice to Morris.
Realizing his negligence, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flexman fired Morris because their departing African-American worker was badly employed and they were waiting for a Filipino wife instead, the New York Post reported.
Morris was paid for one day and sent home with Uber.
Morris now sued the family for dismissal and sought $350 a day in compensation for the six-month house he originally hired, even though he was out of contract.
"I'm going to see that they don't work like this", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "It would be discrimination".
The family responded that they were racist, saying that it was the right move to take Morris off the job, because they feared that we would not trust him after hurting him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to tell him.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
WOULD you, an only child, give your children to someone who would hurt them?
A newborn child?
You see".
Comparing the trial to a "looting", Plasco said that his wife was only two months away from giving birth and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you follow such a person?
This is not a good thing", the investment banker added.
The trial is still ongoing, with the public court quickly sentencing the couple via social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers say they won't accept pupil-speakers in new letter
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born after the book was accepted, wrote: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who's read this book for the first time before it's published.
It is interesting to hear about Paddington's great achievements now".
She said that her father's little toy bear had inspired her to write a children's book before, and that she was optimistic about being rejected for her job as a BBC operator, saying that it was "difficult" to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the book's publication because last year she had to send her father on his final journey.
She called Paddington "a very important member of our family", and her father added that he was quietly proud of her achievements.
"He was a very quiet man, not a boastful one", she said.
Perhaps Paddington was real to her, like a successful girl: you're proud, but you're not part of it.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his dream, he gave Paddington the credit he deserved".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur Hospital No. 2 - where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Ned was calling me often and saying that his condition was very bad and that they couldn't help him", Ednan-Laperoz said.
"Then Ned called me and said he was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye.
And I said goodbye.
I said, "Tashi, my daughter, I love you very much.
See you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications prescribed by doctors to keep his heart working gradually ran out and he left his body.
Soon after, he died, and all that came to an end.
I had to sit back and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I could not cry, scream, or howl, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I really shouldn't have sent it.
At the last line, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with all the passengers, forgetting the past ordeal.
He answered, "No one knows".
I kept my head down, and tears were flowing.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a little sympathy for Ned.
I told her that she needed my love and understanding.
I knew he loved my daughter very much.
Postcards from grieving women to prevent suicide in the press
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to help others avoid suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries placed inspirational messages and postcards with phone numbers on the Wales Bridge to call for help.
Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at age 13 and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel like I do every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lidney, told me with a warm smile that her son was a promising chef.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that her smile lit up the room".
However, before his death, he left his work, for he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was found dead after his brother committed suicide.
Davis said: "I worry every day that it will have a strong impact.
Although Davis was friendly, he made postcards to let people know that there were people he could talk to.
Do not sit still and talk".
Mrs. Humphries, who had been a longtime friend of Davis's, lost her husband of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
He said that it was difficult for him and he did not tell him about the dream he had.
A few days before Christmas, we saw how her attitude changed.
He seemed to be the most important at Christmas time, when he opened the presents for the children, he did not even look at them. "
Her death was a great heartbreak for them, but they had to overcome it: "This is a hole in the family.
That is what separates us.
But we all have to keep going and fight".
If you are struggling to overcome this, you can call Samaritan People at 116 123 (UK and Ireland), write to jo@samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan People website.
Brett Kavano's future hangs in the balance, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation begins work.
"I thought if we could get what he was asking for - a time-limited, limited investigation - we could bring some kind of interaction", Flake said Saturday, expressing fear that the committee was "in the back of the net" against the background of the entrenched partisan end.
Why did Kavano and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is time-dependent.
There are only five weeks until the November 6 midterm elections - and if the Republicans behave badly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get a candidate elected to the country's highest court.
Kavano worked for George W. Bush in the White House and through Bush, met his current wife, Ashley, who was Bush's secretary.
What happens after the FBI reports?
Currently, elections are underway for the Senate, which has 51 Republican and 49 Democratic seats.
It is not yet known whether Kavano will be able to garner at least 50 votes in the Senate chamber, which would allow Vice President Mike Peska to stop the strike and have it confirmed in the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean refugees under Kim has fallen
The South Korean MP said that since Kim Jong-un came to power, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased.
Based on data from the Ministry of Southern Unification, Park Byon Sok reported that there were only 1127 refugees last year, compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pak said that the main factors were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the rising tariffs on smugglers.
Pyongyang did not give any explanation to the people.
Most of the people who came from the North were eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many of them pass more easily through China, the longest border with North Korea, than through the well-guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
The North and South were still at war on one side, but their relations had improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders stopped in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This followed a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June, where they agreed to make the Korean Peninsula atomically free.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yonho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"We will have no national security without any trust in the United States, and we cannot unilaterally disarm in these conditions", Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and declared him unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavano "hysterical" and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview with the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't imagine that they would call her hysterical if she behaved like that", Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday about her reaction to Kavano's testimony.
Kawano emotionally denied the allegations that Dr. Kristin Baynzik raped Ford when she was young.
In her opening statement, Kavano was very emotional, sometimes screaming and in pain, and spoke about her family and school years.
He also repeatedly condemned Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him "a horrific and coordinated murder" - organized by liberals unhappy with Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi felt that Kavano's testimony showed that he was opposed to the Democrats, and therefore could not serve on the Supreme Court.
"I think he's being disqualified by this kind of reporting in a way that's targeting the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi opposed impeaching Kavano if confirmed, and when asked if Democrats would win a majority in the chamber.
"I'm saying this - if she didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, she shouldn't be in the Supreme Court, not in the court that she's in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavano is currently a judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe Wade, as she was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavano did not answer questions about whether he had rejected some of the Supreme Court's rulings.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, negative person to go to court and say, 'Everything is fine,'" Pelosi said.
Women should have rights too.
It's a fair diatribe, angry months and years, that she can't take away without tears.
"We cry when we're angry", Mrs. Staynem told me 45 years later.
"I think it's not that simple, is it?"
She continued: "A woman who worked as a manager helped me a lot, she used to cry when she was angry, but when she got angry and started crying, she used a technique that she would say to this person, she said, 'You must think it's hard for me when I cry too.
I'm really angry.
And then he moves on.
I think that's great.
Due to misunderstanding, tears are allowed as a source of partial relief.
One of the most memorable memories of my male-dominated office work was when I was crying out of anger, and I was caught by an older woman - a cold boss - who was always a little scared - and she dragged me into the driveway.
He told me, "Don't tell anyone what you're doing".
They don't know you're angry.
They think they are saddening you and are happy because they have been able to bring you down.
At the time, she served as a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was involved in an extramarital affair on a boat called the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Shröder, so disappointed, decided that she had no reason not to run for president.
It was a poorly thought-out decision, he told me after 30 years.
There were seven candidates in the race, and they didn't need another one.
Some called it "Belosnezhka and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign was delayed, and she was behind in raising funds, so she vowed not to compete unless she raised $2 million.
This was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave the men $1000 gave her only $250.
"Do they think they will get a discount?" he wondered.
When she announced that she would not participate in the official campaign, she felt this - gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system of fundraising and attracting voter attention, not delegates, and anger at sexism - she breathed.
"You would think I was nervous", Schröder said of the press' reaction to him.
"You think of Kleenex as my corporate donor.
They're going to put something on my grave?
He cried?
How trade war between the US and China could benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps of the US-China trade war were sound, and that the conflict between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, even if the war is not over yet.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing a tax on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting goods worth $200 billion (150 billion euros), with effective tariffs imposed on half of all goods imported into the United States from China.
Beijing responded in kind: It recently added tariffs of five to 10 percent on goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to stay with the United States, and the world's second-largest economy is unlikely to disappear anytime soon.
Limiting Washington means yielding to demands, but it would be uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly worship the United States.
But if Beijing can play its cards right, the US trade war pressure could be a good long-term support for China, which would reduce the interconnectedness of the two economies, experts say.
"If a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create economic conditions in different countries, then the observers will be much more dangerous", said Ebigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security, an analytics center.
Foreign Minister says Syria is "ready" to return refugees
Syria is reportedly ready for the free return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding a country ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid Al-Muallem, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, noted the improvement in conditions in the country.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The authorities continued to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normal life.
Due to the economic measures against terrorism and the daily life and way of life, all conditions are now created for the voluntary repatriation of refugees.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people fled Syria in 2011 as a result of the war.
The country has six million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'aalim said the media would support the Syrian regime in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he made it clear that he would not accept conditional support or support from countries that supported the attackers.
Paris won the Ryder Cup in Europe
In 2018, the European team won the Ryder Cup at Le Golf National in Paris, France, defeating the United States team by a score of 16.5-10.5.
The United States lost six consecutive times on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Denmark won the European crown after his team scored 14.5 points, enough to beat the United States.
US star Phil Mikelson, who fought for most of the tournament, threw the ball into the water on the 3rd hole of the 16th hole, thus winning the match for Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has excelled in all of his tours, with the current tournament format dating back to 1979 with a 1-0-0 record.
American Jordan Smith lost 5-4 to Denmark's lowest ranked player, Torbjorn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, the best player in the world, lost 2-1 to England's Jan Pulter, who last played in the Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Serhió García was the best winner of the European Tour with a career-high 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
So I want to thank Thomas for choosing me and for putting his trust in me.
I am very happy that the trophy is back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy to be able to help", Garcia said emotionally after winning in Europe.
He handed the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm proud to have won Tiger Woods because I grew up watching this guy", said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods won all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
He won 14 major titles, beating only Jack Niclaus, an odd statistic for one of the greatest players of all time.
The U.S. team struggled to find fairways over the weekend, with Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finley trailing, all of whom played top-level golf at the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury said after the team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
Europe was a little warmer this morning.
We were given up.
I took off my hat in front of Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to unite, we're going to work with the American Ryder Cup Committee, we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 young men and am proud to have served as their captain.
You must work out your own way.
We were defeated".
