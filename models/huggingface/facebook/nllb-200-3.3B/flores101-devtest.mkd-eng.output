Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but it also gives details that fossils generally cannot give, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut-brown on the top, and pale or carotenoid on the underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed mane, called a main shaft, but have other features of feathers - soft fibers and soft hairs - the researchers concluded that the main shaft likely represented a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but for thermoregulation or for flapping. The researchers pointed out that, although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not those of a chick.
The researchers noted that although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage, not that of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at a police station in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star, which is related to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of the inversion of the magnetic poles.

The work accomplished is mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observing the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team expects should be caused by the tidal forces and the interstice between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon affects the Earth, causing tides and eclipses, so the Milky Way affects the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists could conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around the galaxy is found somewhere in a kind of halo, and is composed of many small particles.

Candidates may send representatives to testify on every part of the process.

The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to the court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services could remove the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
No one has since appeared in the Edinburgh Crown Court as a suspect in her son's murder.
She's being held pending charges and trial, but any evidence from witnesses could be called into question as her image is posted everywhere.
This is commonplace throughout the UK, but the Scottish justice system is different and the courts consider the publication of images to be a potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "it really seems like journalists are going in a thin line if they publish photos and so on of suspects".
The state prosecutor's office, which has full jurisdiction over the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made until the indictment is complete.
According to the source, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to return to the period before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan River Valley.
Israel is seeking a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years after the deal is signed while the Palestinian Authority agrees to leave the presence for a period of only five years.
The arrows in the additional pest control sample had to be under strict surveillance by the rangers, as the sample was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Under the Sport Hunters Association's hunting program, in cooperation with the NPWS and the Sport Hunters Association of Australia (SHA), qualified volunteers were enrolled.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Parks and Heritage Conservation at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday as the new nine-member Provisional Election Commission (CEC).
This is the fifth interim Martelli election commission in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission suggested that the SER should resign earlier as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Martelli Commission was actually a reaction to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the non-observance of elections, and some date as far back as 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of faulty iPod devices overheating, causing a total of six fires, and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving appliances.
Last week, METI announced that it had received a notification from Apple for 34 more cases of overheating, which the company considered "not serious".
In its response, the Ministry called Apple's delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. (09:19 p.m. GMT Friday) and was followed by a tremor of magnitude 7.4 on the Richter Scale.
Representatives of the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Service said there were no reports of damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held a Hong Kong tourist hostage by hijacking his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as well as the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced the scene with an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She studied to be a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began researching premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" for filming flights on Wednesday.
Luna was also honored by her fellow warriors.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager".
Dustin Goldsmith Runnels commented that "Luna was as far away as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign argued that she believed Australia should become a republic after the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this opinion, wishing Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extremes noted in the survey, 29 percent of the respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have raised doubts about his fitness.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to overcome his pain because it was forbidden by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were a source of water to the Earth, along with organic matter that could create proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, specifically, how the Earth is formed, because long ago comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill allowing same-sex marriages.
He called the voices "political chatter and nonsense".
There's been speculation that he's going to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims allows aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, upgrading old radar-based technology to help flight controllers more accurately determine the aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
There is no additional transportation, and underground trains will not stop at Wembley and parking spaces and public transportation parking lots are not available at the stadium.
The fear of not having transportation increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species developed in just two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Galapagos chinch, Geospiza fortis, and the large cactus chinch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, it can be twisted into small shapes.
It can be dragged in a thin wire, which can be twisted and braided, hammered or dragged in layers.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called a chemical pH value, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is given by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix both dry powder and then, with clean, moist hands, squeeze into a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel unusual and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of sewerage systems have been found in houses in Minoan-era cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Bathrooms existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of a public bathroom, where both men and women would go together.
When you're calling someone from thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back at almost the same time.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, to carry a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an amazing way, and the best thing that the wheel has done for us is to make transportation easier and faster.
He has provided us with the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming pet cats) that eat many smaller animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a domain, a special thing that each cat has that prevents it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called herds.
The herd is composed of one to three blood-related males, along with up to thirty females and young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A lion pack acts similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, as well as being very deadly to their prey.
As an athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of the strongest man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's full-voiced roar, but more like a sentence of words that resemble a roar and a loud cry.
Ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds - almost all the animals that the ocelot catches are considerably smaller than it is.
Scientists think that the ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing the ground where they have been.
They see well in darkness with night vision and move stealthily as well.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it is often in an environment different from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
Our habitats are made of plants, our clothes are made of plants, and plants make up most of the food we eat, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row at the top of its mouth, indicating that it had no recourse to anything that got in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a chattering tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus rex was no match for it.
While most of the food is familiar, the Romans also had their own strange or unusual feasts, such as wild boar, peacocks, reptiles, and a type of rodent called the polus.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting on benches, the rich preferred to have communal feasts, where they could rest while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman dishes certainly did not contain products that came to Europe from the Americas or from Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted chickpeas.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of the gods, which was considered the home of that god.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the needs of the gods through rites and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped elevations, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the mound was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Much of the life of the ancient Jewish family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open-air threshes facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not thickly forested, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Old Norse lore, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled west, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Despite each country being "Scandinavian", there were a multitude of differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure", you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map of hidden treasure.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text is reversed and stands at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was originally wrapped for safekeeping.
So it's possible that the note was simply written as a sign.
The landings of D-Day and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
It was run by the "Vichy French", who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies entered Southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated the South of France and marched on Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture formed by a significant large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city, which also defines the size of society.
Civilized culture suggests the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a long-lasting cultural imprint and a rather large spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government - the only component of which was Congress - under the Treaty of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, lacking a national executive or judicial body, it relied on state bodies, often uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to override the laws on taxes and duties between states.
Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Among the most popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often geographically referred to as an  archipelago
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors spelled the island's name as Ilja Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a change in local grain-processing habits and employing Chinese agar-agar to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main buildings, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a glimpse of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the film size that prevailed at the end of the analog film era.
It's still made today, but more importantly, its ratios are inherited from the sensory image formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of an integer) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS group of formats) are the same or significantly closer in ratio.
The most abused and often mocked right of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the image.
It states that it is most effective to place the main subject at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subject to criticism.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity had united European nations for over a thousand years.
Her all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the central Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds are for that purpose only.
The central authority of the church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has caused many to question whether the principles were being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off much-needed supplies to the military and civilians, though the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
With little opportunity to respond to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifist and isolationist attitudes prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a collection of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of divided provinces between each dynasty, the most famous of these phases being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
This period was marked by bitter rivalry between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, when thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the earth belongs to all people rather than just one single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, jobs were opened up for all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true in the military because, instead of ranking in the military being based on class, it was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things outside of this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as Hira on the mountain Nur (light) to meditate.
He is locked in a cave, which has survived through time, giving a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knew they were fasting.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza remains today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of a number of large pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Death Valley contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "top" arrow is like a V, and the "bottom" arrow is like a joint or square that lacks its bottom.
Up means you start at the top and push the pin, and down means you start at the frog's hand (where your palm holds the pin) and pull the pin.
Moving upward with the cymbal produces a softer sound, while moving downward produces a louder and more aggressive sound.
Feel free to write your own characters, but remember, printed notes are there for a musical reason, so normally they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris, from Versailles, on 6 October 1789 by a group of market women.
They rode back to Paris in a coach, surrounded by a mob that screamed and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, a man in the crowd was waving the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military costs of the American imperialism in the Philippines conquest were met by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to defray most of the cost, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super-profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos was a major asset of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time period in which the events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from a technological impetus or technological imperative to a strong sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology, in and of itself, follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has an "impact" on societies that is inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a state-level road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new methods are being developed in manufacturing to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increased frequency of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography created individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with geography emerged, and in harmony with the place of society, they were superior to arbitrary imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status deteriorated during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than what was offered by the Byzantine markets.
During this period the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style culminated between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
Yet, because of slow communication channels, Western fashion was able to lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the great developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people began to use buttons to secure clothing.
Existential agriculture is agriculture that is done to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds originating from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, as is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may differ as a result of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style that encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look back at a few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misery or deliberate abuse by adults, remained unsocialized while growing up.
Such children are called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children have been locked up by people (often by their parents); in some cases this abandonment of the child was a result of the parents' rejection of the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Rude children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others are said to have grown from animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully grown from animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (in physical limits) almost the same as the animal that cared for it, such as fear of or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, a technique called "building scales" goes one step further.
The technique called "building the scaffold" is not a learning method but rather a tool that provides support for individuals going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scale, but so is the Microsoft Office docking man.
Virtual scales are built into the software and are designed to interrogate, prompt, and explain procedures that may have been too difficult for the student to master on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages or foster homes for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but still growing.
We believe the Grate System is a safe zone for these children.
Our welfare system should provide safe homes, caring caregivers, a stable education and a secure health system.
The care should provide all the needs they lacked in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet contains elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to pleasure.
For example, learning and socialization have been proposed as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) identify "personal engagement" and "personality" as new motivational aspects, exploring audience reactions to web pages.
The use of video has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it could be possible to detect whether someone is lying by accurately interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", noted how people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection allows for the removal of expressed variations from the group.
Segregation and recombination shift the variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its needs for amino acids from available plant sources.
Further, failure to do so would have serious consequences - stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and berries, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (frogs, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm to alert you without fully waking you up.
If you accidentally stop the clock while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bedtime, which makes a person have to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the pressure, the more positive the life force is present.
The only thing that's stopping us from getting there is the pressure and the negativity from us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded with the Mahayana path of love and a multitude of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the "divine yoga". Through visualization of several deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and everything about enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war ended, differences in systems, processes and culture led to disagreements between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and to be fought in real combat, with proxy armies, on the war fronts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defensive force had already been defeated and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Roman bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 troops from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of eastern parts of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
Transporting goods by ship is definitely the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job, by tradition, is to ensure your country maintains the ability to transport your people and goods, and at the same time, to impede the enemy's ability to transport their people and goods.
One of the most important examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop such traffic.
If the Allies had suffered defeat, Germany could probably have conquered Britain just as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them so they could easily access milk, fur, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or pastures, tended by goats that were usually children or adolescents, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Horse-drawn trams were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were mainly built of parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses for greater speed and to pull a greater load than that carried on the bad roads of the time.
Rail sills were used early on to hold the rails in place, but it was gradually found that the rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused a greater expenditure on wooden wheels than wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, the first train with all-iron wheels was launched.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not so good at walking upright.
Two-legged adaptations have been found in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have split into two legs seven million years ago.
We can start to be more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and maybe even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
In many cases this is the same as symptomatic treatment, but if the solution is not temporary, the root of the problem must be found and thus eradicated.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of humankind, and the problems have been made worse by the overpopulation and extravagant life-style of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the manuscript draft, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomas, was sent a few blocks down to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 specimens were made, known today as the "Danlap Pages".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of the Independence Building on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap documents that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, called birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that make them still look like dinosaurs.
They have shelled feet and claws, lay eggs and move on their two hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on information management encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or if computer jargon is used, bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, so a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open box of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term beetle in a formal sense.
The term derives from the ancient similarity of the cockroach, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the larvae and the parasites are nidicolous, adapted to live in a nest or give home to their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) throughout the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the birth parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can have parental rights over the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method, and in fact, it is the method that guides most of the scientific research.
But not only that, but experimentation, and an experiment is a sample that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observation, also drive scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with a special emphasis on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
A multitude of observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often consciously depend heavily on the presence of endogenous cycles and their creation via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free cyclic motion even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading assumptions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, while mutated cells anywhere else can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the plant and animal world.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing and studying the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and mingle with others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shared transport, everyone is somehow connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for the past two million years.
Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed lands, such complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints, why do they disappoint on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers know to stick to a reasonably constant frame; so traffic flows know to have a certain reasonably constant and can be mathematically represented roughly.
To better visualize the flow of traffic, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road structures.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards alongside their bodies.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the fairy horses and the unicorns.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, carrying more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, stretching some six miles [6.5 km] in some places.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers around the world into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main course is 6387 km (3980 mi) long, and water is collected from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in their size and technical exceptionalism of construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which by then were already more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
Legislation and official communication of the Vatican are in Italian.
Italian is also used in everyday speech by the working people of the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle considered everything to be composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
It is something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also believed that they change into new substances to create what we see.
Note that the periodic table is made up of many elements.
Metals are considered to be elements such as calcium and potassium.
There may also be alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so small that a trillion of them could be put together in the dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil's status and use declined.
People are now writing messages on computers and never have to go near a shovel again.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The physics bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to create a nucleus from a multitude of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and then, when the nucleus splits again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they have a tendency to decay with or without slight upheaval.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
Thin beneath the seas, thick beneath the plains.
There may be more basaltic plane on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it is easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what excites people or what they like.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from children to adults.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, there are two ways in which managers can behave when they begin to manage their former colleagues: on the one hand, it is an attempt to remain "one of the boys" (or "one of the girls").
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person turns into an unrecognizable person who feels that he or she has to change everything that the team has done and make it his or her way.
However, the leader bears the ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Such behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams operate to the same standards of excellence as standard teams, but there are some small differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of the conventional team because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a truly "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an outstanding component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the team to which each member belongs, and the visible team sets the standards for each member.
One goal of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity are sparked.
As a result, the organization's collaborative process of overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process of serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the foundation of scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This provides a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science fiction connotations, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research of artificial intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and user queries, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things became separate disciplines, which focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being incorporated into several software applications for home computers and video games, the AI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a big part of every classroom, and oftentimes, the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours, where students can explore museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in a class.
And the virtual sharing excursion is a good way to remember the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a web page for their trip to the state capital, every year the web page is reconstructed, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogging also helps to improve students' writing. Although students often start the blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, audience presence mainly changes that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging forces students to become aware of the world around them. The need to nurture the interest of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' written texts, and also highlight their own views on specific issues (Oraвец, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, characterized by an array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untamed natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more make Ontario uniquely Canadian, as foreigners see it.
The vast areas to the north are quite sparsely populated, and some of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are allied with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands and it quickly spread to the Comoros and the Maya.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all women travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider abuse and that it is not uncommon to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men and don't be afraid to stick to your point (with or without cultural differences, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan re-established the city as Darou I-Badia, but by the Spanish merchants who established trading bases here it was given the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tarjins, clay pots, leather goods, nargile and a whole range of cheap ornaments, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far eastern parts near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that overwhelmed most of the city streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any visit outside Goma should be checked to find out the state of unrest that persists in North Kivu province.
The town is also the base for climbing to the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla hunts in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, Timbuktu is today an impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites, due to the threat of desert sand dunes.
He was one of the main hosts during the PBS special, "The Wonder of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has more Arab charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each with a different animal world.
The isthmus is one of the largest attractions in South Africa and is considered the forerunner of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily maintenance fees and park entrance fees.
It can also be useful to buy a "Wild Card" that can be used to enter any park in South Africa or all of the national parks in South Africa.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island and it is the place that is the main focus of many tourists.
The arrangement of the buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline is illustrated by a brilliant graphic that is highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head opposite the coast of Kowloon.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the arid land along the northern coast.
It's where the British colonists took over, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the longest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast, into the Bangladeshi and Indian interior.
Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps of rhizophores - they comprise some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area is now home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30 hours.
Since intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese minibuses are used.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 Ng) and Punakha (200 Ng).
The Ojacoque River Bridge is a suspension bridge that crosses the Ojacoque River and connects the cities of Ojacoque in Brazil and Saint Georges de L'Ojacoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 273 feet [83 m], are 1,227 feet [378 m] long, and have two 12 foot [3.50 m] wide walkways.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters (15 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully functional by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payagua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "Great Province of Southeast Asia", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo competitions, check out Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money is exchanged at the islands' only bank located in Stanley, directly across from the FIC West store.
British pounds are mainly accepted throughout the islands and alongside Stanley credit cards, US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and American currency may be available; check with the owners beforehand to determine which payment method is acceptable to you.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange the money before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures above +30 degrees Celsius are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but wind and moisture together make them colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific "reversible" or "sustainable" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park service guidelines, keep at least 100 yards/ meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/ meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how pet they may look, buffalo, elk, bears, and almost any large animal could attack.
These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food that has a strong smell, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
It was founded in the 1850s, and since 1959 has been officially the capital of Samoa.
In 1889, the port experienced the infamous naval blockade when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except one British battleship, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
In the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamase Lialofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland covers two harbours. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in North Harbor County) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devenport in the south.
Almost all of the sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most have shade from the more pointy trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are on the Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Messine Bay and St Helier in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that get crowded sometimes, with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The most famous local beer is called Nambar wan, which is not a heavy but a pleasant and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines that can be taken, but wines from New Zealand and Australia can travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can be easily found if you are picky.
Australians are not typical of the idea of "ordinary white coffee". Short black coffee is "espresso", cappuccino is with a lot of slag (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is made to Belgian standards, and while expensive, the fruit juices are excellent.
Trips to the reef are frequent throughout the year and it is rare for a reef to be damaged by these reasons.
However, take the advice of the authorities, observe all signs, and heed safety warnings.
The gooseberry occurs along beaches and estuaries from October to April north of 1770. Occasionally it can be found outside this time period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people anyway.
Sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean all the time, their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, a traveler can rest assured that he will have a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you can also book accommodation elsewhere, such as camping, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies commonly offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also save your reservation if you need some time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any alterations or requests should be checked with the travel agent first, not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival visitors choose to camp at the location, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the center of the action as possible, you'll have to get in early and get a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music on the main stages has ended, there are parts of the festival where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cab's location because crossing the ice creates a terrible sound for the most vulnerable.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include a city pass, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special deals on food, drinks and entertainment to keep the guests in the mood and stay here.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low and you cannot drive like on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or snowfall or by condensation or freezing of vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic runs almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most popular for many visitors.
The popular sense of the term safari refers to a land journey to observe the beautiful African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to the vehicles, so standard equipment also provides a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are best seen with a close-up view.
"A walking safari (also called a ""wildlife walk"", hiking safari"" or "walking"") consists of walking, either for a few hours or a few days".
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked a 2020 flight and accommodation before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
There are differences in cancellation policies but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not continue until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have ashtrays and ashtrays available for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have a soot, or if you don't want to wear soot socks, then you can try a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to let the material become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, combustion).
Although there are various ways of purifying water, some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes just one minute to boil water, while in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, which is something to consider, and you should consider buying sealed bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are not present in the regions from which they come.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation or, in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can brutalize or kill a human, are not considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to purchase goods exempt from paying taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Point Marion to Fairmont trail has the most exciting driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, passing through isolated wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: high cliffs, narrow roads, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections, usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Yet, miraculously, the mobile signal is much stronger here than in other areas, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those in their neighbor to the south, Austria.
Fruit pancakes are commonly made with apples in the dough throughout the year, and cherries and plums can be found in the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nutty fruits.
If you like small but rich sweets, try these, called berliner, fancuchen, or krapfenn, depending on the region.
A curry is a food with herbs and spices, containing meat or vegetables.
The carrot may be "dry" or "dry" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the continental parts of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used to prepare curry dishes; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
The word Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses the various regional cuisines found throughout the nation of 17,000 islands.
But when used without additional attributes, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine displays a choice of simply spiced dishes, the most dominant flavors of Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle pins are the supports for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the rider, but there may also be safety considerations due to the likelihood of their feet getting stuck in them.
If a horse throws a rider, but his foot gets caught in the bridle, if the horse escapes, it is possible to pull the rider. To minimize the risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear heels and a very tight, fat, thigh.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety handles that allow the harness belt to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls on the fall.
Cochami Valley - The main mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with various large granite walls and fissures.
The peaks offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes through the endless potential of the mountainside.
Alpine winter sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you skate across snowy terrain with skis or snowboards on your feet.
 Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, often known as  skiers , whose entire vacation revolves around skiing at a specific location.
The skiing scene is very old - there are cave paintings of skiers from as far back as 5000 BC!

Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean more visa and passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, acts somewhat like a state in this respect.
As long as you are in this zone, you can in principle cross borders without constantly passing passport checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
