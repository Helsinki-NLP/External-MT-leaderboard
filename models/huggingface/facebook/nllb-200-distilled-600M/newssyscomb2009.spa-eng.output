The victory of the populist right in Austria, together they make up 29%
The early elections to the Austrian parliament have, according to the first approximate results, brought about a considerable weakening of both parties in the current grand coalition and an expressive strengthening of the populist right-wing party.
The Austrian People's Party (OVP) has suffered heavy and special losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously undermined.
On the contrary, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (AFI), the head of the Carinthia state government, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) remains the strongest party in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, losing 5.5 percent of the vote compared to the last election in 2006.
Worse still, the OVP has finished losing 25.6 percent, almost nine percent of the vote.
These are the worst, literally catastrophic results in the history of these two great Austrian parties since the postwar period and especially for the popular people who called these early elections.
As early as July, when the OVP left the coalition, the populars had a considerable advantage over the SPO.
It is clear, however, that the voters punished them for letting the government sink.
Already in the first reactions to the results speculation was heard about the resignation of the party president and, until today, vice chancellor, Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this Monday could be reached at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
Such a development would obviously facilitate the path to the constant and most approximate starting point of the electoral results, namely the renewal of the large coalition between SPO and OVP.
Given that the strengthening of both populist right-wing parties - the Liberals (FPO) have won about 18 percent and the BZO, 11 percent of the vote - and that the Social Democrats at the same time expressed their fears that the same thing would happen again in 1999 when the populars negotiated with the populists (then FPO was a unit, but in 2005 it broke away from BZO) for a coalition government that would eventually generate a sanction from the European Union.
This is clearly the case with Mr Haider, who has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and is now returning to Vienna.
The Green Party has also managed to reach parliament, although it has lost slightly and dropped from third to fifth place among Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly exceeded the four percent threshold and is therefore not a member of parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may get cold
If the problem of the Czech scientists who have been accused in India of illegally collecting beetles is not solved, the Czech-Indian relations could become colder, according to Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was stated by the minister in New York, after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this were not resolved then yes, then yes it would be safely reached at this cooling", he said after the meeting organized by the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the meeting that the executive can hardly get involved in legal matters.
However, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the government can negotiate with the local government of Darjiling, under whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"Your problem could be solved", the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best if he appealed to the highest courts.
He said he could then apply for a waiver of his cause and await his sentence.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his colleague expressed himself in the same terms during the meeting.
"I recommend that the High Court be appealed and then the pardon is possible", said the Czech Foreign Minister.
The only way the Czech side can get involved is to get the convicted a "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
He also said that such support is already being obtained by the Indian side.
"We have a strong interest in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it", Schwarzenberg said.
Moreover, as the ČTK said, he insisted before his colleague that the Czech Republic considers the problem of Czech entomologists of great importance.
"We consider it a tremendous mistake to imprison and condemn these Czech scientists", he announced.
The minister eluded the answer to the question whether he had received from the Indian side the promise that he would deal with the matter.
"I have received quite a few promises", he merely stated.
A Czech referee a fight on the seabed
I'm going to an electronic wall map, and it shows Australia surrounded by the sea.
He is not interested, however, in the continent but in a small lost spot in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and alongside it also the surrounding seabed.
The region is, at the same time, as large as a single continent", says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the 30-member team working at the UN Division for Ocean and Sea Law.
Its chief, the head of the Division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and sometimes completes it.
It governs this passion and enthusiasm for work.
The seabed still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
Oil and other mineral raw materials can be found, but also unknown organisms to this day that in themselves carry the key to the development of cancer drugs.
The bottom is bigger than the land
The coastal countries have begun to contend vehemently today over the new undersea territories.
Under the UN Treaty, these countries are taking advantage of the rights they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is basically the so-called Continental Edge, which sometimes extends a few hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
The Treaty provides for exclusive rights to all resources on the Continental Shelf.
"Continent edge" means simply the part of the seabed and its surface, which is the natural continuation of the continental shelf underwater.
It reaches the border of the sea coast, and often the border of the 200 nautical miles, that is, the pure economic zone", Mikulka explains.
The request submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the external borders of the Continental Shelf must be submitted with scientific technical documentation based on research and measures.
It's the result of a series of years of work preparation.
"One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal aid committee.
The Commission has so far processed five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have come forward", Mikulka adds.
Not long ago, Australia's success had a worldwide impact as it was the first to essentially expand its maritime domain.
But New Zealand has also done so - the seafloor area the commission granted last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, almost six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in their study.
The profits from the use of the seabed will be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also gradually submitting their applications.
They can do so up to ten years after ratifying the 'Montego Bay Treaty'.
Where the Continental Shelf ends begins the region of the ocean floor declared by the Treaty as "the common heritage of mankind".
No nation has an exclusive position here.
The right to exploit in these areas is governed by the Treaties established by international institutions.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold mine", says Director Mikulka emphasizing, adding "that its separate zones are legally and clearly restricted and its regime defined by contract".
The Czechs in the Pacific
And today, part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is distributed with other countries of the then Eastern Bloc within the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
This was achieved in 1991 with a Treaty as investors as did a few other states, states called "the pioneer investor".
It has the power to explode in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is somewhat larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom over there is rough, it's kind of a sea replica of the Tatras.
"A total area of 75,000 square kilometers can be exploited.
The area is rich in polymetallic concrete deposits containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese", adds Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employee of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of that kind of concrete.
It reminds us of a little potato or with a little bit of fantasy, the Shem, who according to legend revived the Golem.
During the release of the hostages the German special forces command was on the scene of the action
To solve the hostage crisis the Egyptian government had asked for the help of Germany - experts came.
When the situation got serious, the special forces command was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More and more details are being learned about the circumstances surrounding the release of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, the German special forces also took an indirect part in the rescue operation.
The release site was therefore occupied by specialists from the German army as well as officials from GSG 9, a German police air squadron, the Federal Criminal Investigation Office and the technical charity's logistics experts.
As ministry spokesmen reported on Monday night, German forces were not needed because the kidnappers, realizing a violent release, let their prisoners go and escaped.
The Egyptian government accepted Germany's help to use it as support on the spot.
"Fortunately that moment did not come", said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
On September 19 in southern Egypt, the assailants had kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Romanian as well as 8 Egyptian companions.
After the abduction in the desert region of southern Egypt, the hostages were deported from one side to the other in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unknown until the end as well as details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Meanwhile, the rescued people arrived in Cairo, safe and sound.
Steinmeier said the hostages released were under the guardianship of the German embassy.
He didn't say a word about the details of the release.
At first there was no information in Berlin about their return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, 5 tourists and special forces have to return on the German air force's Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The United States House of Representatives does not approve the rescue package
The first chamber of the United States Congress barely let a huge $700 billion bailout package for financial markets fail.
The Dow Jones fell very sharply.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government's financial markets bailout package by 227 votes to 206.
Despite all the calls from President George W. Bush and former politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the programme that should limit the disorder in financial markets.
With dramatic action, desperate defenders had still tried to convince critics to accept the huge $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, the leader of the Democratic negotiations, had asked the deputies to vote, although the plan is not as popular.
"It is difficult to get political approval to avoid something that has not yet happened", he admitted.
Already during the vote the Dow Jones fell to over 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of that was investors' concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He rested at the end of the vote and after the failure was made public, he fell again.
Experts are facing other serious turbulence in international financial markets.
To get the program into effect, it is necessary to have the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers record an increase in bookings
It seems to be a good winter for German travel planners:
According to one study, the volume of travel bookings sales for the coming months increased compared to last year - even the winter season by more than 30 percent.
According to one study, despite the weakened situation, the desire to travel of the Germans remains the same.
As reported on Monday by the German travel association (DVR) in Berlin, with winter travel bookings, travel agencies recorded sales volumes that are 31 percent higher compared to the same period last year.
According to the research of the GfK Market Research Institute, reserves for the autumn months had already increased in number.
Thus, the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost eleven percent higher than in 2007, DVR reported.
The results are based on GfK figures which are the information analysed on bookings at 1200 travel agencies and computed for approximately the entire market.
The data collected are travel bookings made up to the end of August 2008.
The DRV reported that due to the weakening dollar price, especially travel to the United States is in high demand.
In this case the number of reservations increased to almost a third.
The preferred destinations of Germans are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece but also the regions of Germany.
Especially are organized trips very popular, explains Klaus Laepple, the president of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices are rising, in this case travel expenses are 'better calculable for the customer than during an individual trip'.
Among other things, consumers can save money with early booking discounts or All-Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Also in the summer months travel was well booked, so sales volumes compared to last year rose again - although according to another study the number of Germans making a trip, compared to last year, fell.
My first Oktoberfest
The hits of the open-air parties at the endless Spa, the beer in a liter jar and the famous people dressed in traditional Bavarian designer suits.
A debut in a tent.
Susanne Kronzucker and I really don't have much in common.
She's blonde, the TV hostess and wears a custom traditional Bavarian costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is already worn.
But there's one thing that unites us: as soon as we're in the tent, the photographers rushed to us and filled their memory cards with photos - it's very flattering, especially because it's my first time at Oktoberfest.
That's how you make friends.
The traditional cheap Bavarian costume seems to serve its purpose.
In fact, as a tourist at the Oktoberfest from northern Germany my sense of well-being in traditional Bavarian costumes to this day was still limited.
But after we get to the Prado de Teresa, it's not all for that.
Almost everyone wears traditional Bavarian costumes or leather pants; none seem to be to be paying attention or feeling unpleasant - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my diaper gets weird looks next to a banana stand in chocolate.
A muniquee calls my attention to my diaper that I was wearing in the wrong way: "The left side is single, the half is virgin, the right side is engaged, the back is widow".
Oh, my God, I'm now crouching behind to the left.
"All right", he says with a laugh.
Others don't care much about subtle methods of flirting and wear hats where it says "To drink to get dressed!" and show off their bare asses without asking.
A young boy who behaves exhibitionistically is called Bob, he's from England and he's also at the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He thinks it's "gorgeous", which he pronounces with a very long "or".
He tells me after he put his glass of a pint of beer that he just drank next to him.
He put it right next to the fire mouth, most people think that's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of the famous people who can drink a lot.
The others are not very lucky and can't consume as much alcohol.
At about eight o'clock at night, health groups run through the party venue and have to worry about poor drunkards.
The sanitarians appear in groups every time - suddenly there are always four people bringing the covered floors from one tent to the other.
That works like most visitors: They arrive sober, they come back drunk.
You don't see who's got the alcohol levels and is on the move.
"They're the ones who 'can't do it anymore,' " a health care worker answered my question and disappeared in tumult.
Police identified accident victim
The 63-year-old pedestrian has been identified who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex County.
Carole Paulson, of Chelmsford Road, Brentwood, was involved in the accident that occurred on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
The woman was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving.
He's been released on bail since.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey was a member of the European Union, the European powers were keen to penetrate the interior of the country.
In the eastern part of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps into Asia, lies one of the most interesting relics of the disastrous imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in neo-Renaissance style.
At least, that's what the guides say.
The building is positioned at the end of the platforms and carries two towers, one for each corner, appearing to everyone as a typical German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The building at your compound is a little decayed.
But once it passed the vault box office, there is no doubt of the greatness of the company that this was the westernmost gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation consortium.
Germany, a latecomer in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this railroad that ran to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond in what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany failed during World War I.
Their railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, led to a fall in the
British rule and as the forces advanced into Egypt, they pushed the Turks and their German ally out of Palestine and Syria.
The news was bad for Hyderpasha station too.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources commented that this was sabotage.
Since then the station has decayed and remained on the sidelines of history.
But today, this railway, a gateway to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolically - to highlight Turkey's willingness to expand its diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party - the AKP - has planned a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there's a new policy of collaboration.
The Turkish government has excellent relations with Israel and Syria, with both the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To assess the parameters of this new foreign policy, I got on a bunk and went to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leaders of the AKP, an expert on foreign policy, the Turkish Prime Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a trip of shaking, which produced the old world sequences in the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital - a new city, designed to rule a new secular state, far from the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, with its clear Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish consensus
It has aroused some suspicion in the West and especially in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by built-up middle-market malls and "power bakeries" where middle-class managers in business suits - men and women - meet early in the morning to make a deal/do business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost any party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he still has a Blackberry.
"The objective of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly", he tells me.
Turkey has been cut off from its internal relations.
Today you must look at the same time to the east and the west.
It's not a case if it's not one way or the other.
You have to do both.
"But surely at some point", I ask, "Turkey might be forced to choose?"
"Turkey", he replies, "does not want to face that election".
I would like to stress a point which almost everyone I have spoken to has recited to me almost by heart: Turkey's relations with the Middle East, the Caucasus region and the entire Black Sea are a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on board, Europe in its complex can metaphorically assemble those railway lines that open the world to East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at Hydarpasha Station, after a second sleepless night, my thoughts return to the two German gentlemen, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who had attended the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised would you be to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East, to a large extent, would be in the hands of Turkey today?
And waiting for the ferry to take me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe".
So there's no question about what continent this fascinating country should claim.
Lives to Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as Guildford's music director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (scale, September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As part of the musical project for the city, the following year she founded her magnificent youth choir, Proteus.
It was supposed to be for the under-21s, but by the time the Proteus sang its finale in 1979, several of us were in our late 20s - we just refused to go to the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being changing forms) represented the will of the choir and the ability to perform any music presented to it, be it madrigal or Messiaen, regardless of whether accompanied or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by this youth choir was often surprising, always exciting, and it was all because of that man's inspiration and enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant throughout the years.
Tod often told us to "let the music speak for itself".
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all there, in the music.
That's just how you sing!"
Her wand was always absolutely clear and precise, though never imposing, nor too florid.
Whatever the musical score was, it always ended up on an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any driver should have been a gentleman, this is Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during his two decades as conductor of the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Especially in the last 40 years, I've reviewed over 100 of their concerts and I can honestly say that I've never, ever, ever been disappointed by any of them. Otherwise, I've been inspired by them many times.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of greatness and extreme personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, in his words, simply "sold one or two very well-known war horses around the world".
We're going to miss him a lot.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his sequel to William Woodruff (25 September) they state that "in 1946 he resumed studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 won a research scholarship from Houblon-Norman... at the same time he was studying for a bachelor's degree, a master's degree and a doctorate".
This is learned from a note by Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but it's not entirely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J.D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
He spent the years 1950-51 in the United States, enjoying a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to overlook this part of his career remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology
"I recommend the exhibition by José Vicente Resino "Flamenco y vida" because his black and white, documentary-style photographs are fantastic.
I was struck by their simplicity and the force they convey, always treating the protagonists with great respect.
A show that shows a lot of feeling.
Resin can capture magical moments".
Second assault for the Honda surplus
In November, Honda will begin the second generation of the Jazz.
If its predecessor already had a wide habitability, this new single-seater car has an even wider interior space.
In addition, refined mechanics increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz is aesthetically similar to the model it is, the changes introduced in this single-cylinder are numerous.
Among other things, an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics are to be noted.
However, before analysing the new model, it should be noted that this new Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was introduced on the market.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter period than that employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less well known, in other markets this model is a sales phenomenon.
This is the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, almost a million Jazz units have been sold since its release.
The second market has been the Old Continent, with around half a million units in six years.
However, Honda intends that this new Jazz will increase sales within the segment.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese firm sold a total of 83,000 Jazz units, in 2009 estimates point to 100,000 cars, which would represent a 17% growth in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, representing 6,7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the Spanish branch managers expect to sell 2,000 units of the Jazz in a full year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly halt the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, which is 4,000 fewer than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain, reaching 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese firm also expects to achieve 2% in 2010.
To achieve this quota Honda relies on the arrival of another new model.
It is the Insight, a compact, five-door, 4.37-meter-long, hybrid, which the Japanese company expects to sell about 200,000 units a year worldwide.
By markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be made in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation in partnership is made in January in Valencia.
With respect to the first generation, the new Jazz is growing at all its heights.
Its length is up to 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), width up to 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and axle distance up to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, does not vary and remains at 1.52 meters.
Along with increasing dimensions, the habitability of the interior also increases.
This gain is due, firstly, to the inclusion of a new platform and, secondly, to the introduction of the fuel tank in the central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - also rises to 399 litres, 19 litres more than the capacity of the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are from the version with the 1.4 engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 boot is 379 liters.
Other improvements - in addition to external elements such as rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass - are an improvement in access to the rear seats.
And the doors that give access to the second row have an opening angle of 80 degrees, versus the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
There are also new engines in this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercial launch, this small model will have two 1.2 and 1.4 litre petrol engines.
Both machines incorporate i-VTEC technology that achieves lower consumption, low carbon dioxide emissions, excellent mechanical refinement and at the same time high torque throughout the engine system.
The first 1.2 litre mechanics gets a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm. at 4,900 turns.
This engine - previously rated at 78 horsepower by Jazz - has a 5.3-liter power output and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The previous generation had 83 horsepower, but now it has 100.
This 1.4 horsepower Jazz achieves a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies Nissan has taken inspiration, this time from nature, specifically bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, based on the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step in collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is presented as an expansion of Nissan's four-area Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to strengthen the collision prevention capability of the brand's vehicles.
During their flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that closely resembles the Nissan Safety Shield.
But most importantly, the bee's composite eyes, capable of seeing at an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, allowing it to fly uninterrupted within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers designed what they have called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius of the BR23C, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to an onboard microprocessor that immediately results in collision prevention.
"The moment it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at a right or higher angle to avoid collision.
The biggest difference with any existing system is that the evasion maneuver is totally instinctive.
Otherwise, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be deflected up or down, nor diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in infinite directions and ways like bees.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, to prevent the small robot from collisions.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and act on that data.
It doesn't require saving information or intuitive logic from previous maneuvers, so it can work continuously with only a couple dozen KBs of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we're not talking about memory gigs, not even mega gigs".
This is the first step in developing new instant collision prevention technologies, a technology Nissan predicts will be introduced into production cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than the variety of lithium ions.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding roadblocks.
Shake before you mortgage
It must be acknowledged that the US Treasury Department, besides having plenty of fluid to inject, is not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from getting into junk mortgages at questionable credit bonds, they've created a fun and informative browser game: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
I mean, the "bad credit hotel"... or the mess.
The quirky aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think once, twice and even three times if it's time to apply for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably your goal.
It is true that you have useful information, but not very detailed.
It's more of a teenage page than a site for all audiences.
What if the game is over?
Well, there's a dream room inside the hotel.
Something is something, because buying a better house doesn't even talk...
Morgan Stanley sells a stake in Japanese MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its capital of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first Japanese bank, which will disburse nine billion dollars to acquire 21 percent of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a sharp drop in its stock market share.
A week after discovering a provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9 percent of Morgan Stanley's common stock at a unit price of $25.25, or $3 billion.
The agreed price is less than 19% of the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the purchase of convertible bonds which will ensure a 10% return and a $31.25 conversion price.
Morgan Stanley specified that the global transaction would be carried out on the basis of a price per unit of measure of 29 dollars, or 28% above its current exchange rate.
Morgan Stanley's stock was down 6.79% at $23.07 each at 5:00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status", explained Juan Mack, the group's American CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have allowed it to diversify its activities but it's passing under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious course than before.
The terms of the deal, which were announced last Monday, show that the deal has been amended over the past few days: Last Monday, Morgan announced it would sell up to 20 percent of its shares to Japanese investors for nearly $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the CEO of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, 'we thought the participation would have been made up of ordinary shares only.
But given the current economic and market situation, we have wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves".
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their carrying amount.
And the operation will translate into a dilution of about 20% of profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into ordinary shares within one year if they are sold at more than 50% above the conversion price, or at approximately $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley claims that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
A spokeswoman for the group refused to give details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he's been relieving his balance sheet a lot since late August.
The last few weeks have been exhausting for the group, which saw its stock market share drop by half as the cost of security against a risk of defects over its debt skyrocketed.
This cost was falling last Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the other "survivor" of Wall Street's big investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part for Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, following the example of his colleagues and friends, is the third to put a draft new constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished: 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results, which were 80% of the votes cast.
According to these results, the "no" got 28%, 7%, zero votes and 0.7% blank votes.
For the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls outside the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organisation had announced a widespread victory for the "yes", estimating it at between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had also claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on Sunday night.
"The Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians who head the government of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
Thus, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also by his Chilean colleague Micaela Bachelet.
The elections, which will be held in full calm, according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission, referred to a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution implies increasing the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially by extracting oil from foreign companies and by sending foreign currency to its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also grants reinforced powers to the head of state, who can serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and have the possibility of dissolving the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the president began to implement in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50 percent of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also provides for the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US drug operations.
The 19 people kidnapped have been released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions kidnapped in the desert ten days ago arrived unharmed in the Egyptian capital after being released on Monday afternoon.
By morning, they had been released by Egyptian special forces in Chad.
All of them looked good when they arrived at 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at the Al Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported by helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for medical examination, so they have not been able to speak to the press.
"They are in good health" and "no ransom was paid" to the kidnappers, said Egypt's Tourism Minister Zoheir Garana at the airport.
On September 19, these hostages were taken by 35 unknown kidnappers while enjoying an outdoor safari in a deserted area at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, and have since moved from one node to another.
The group consisted of eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the travel agency Aegyptous, which organises the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members, transported aboard two helicopters, had launched the assault during the night before dawn.
"A exchange of fire took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others have fled", said the official, who kept his name.
According to him, 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit were sent to Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
The Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade the role played by the secret agents and members of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men of the secret services, the special forces", he said without going into detail.
He also denied the ransom payment.
The Sudanese army said it had intercepted a patrol vehicle on board which the kidnappers were on board, killing six, including the Chadian chief and detaining two.
He also claimed that they were linked to a Darfur rebel group, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), a claim immediately denied by this group.
Letters - Silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture has made headlines and is taking place in the current election campaign.
It's better this way.
But one area of our cultural life is always forgotten.
Who will stand up and denounce the miserable sums paid to small museums, archives, archaeological digs or national historic sites starving to death?
What politician would dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
Why don't we have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage like in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government is spending 3.5 million euros to restore only the Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In the United States, it's written in its Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage has to be protected by all citizens, all elected officials and all government departments, and all of this, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Federation des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 benevolent people regrouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with researching history, preserving with little money large amounts of private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
These are often the guard dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and desperation when promoters and officials throw their bulldozers at our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a monument to history and heritage?
The Dutch governments nationalize a part of Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands - the first in Europe - will help to nationalize the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which is in trouble because of the impact of the mortgage crisis on the North American market: the three countries will support the financial and insurance institution, which also has operations in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
This weekend the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands held higher-level consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's economic competence officer.
The first eurozone crisis was experienced by Fortis Bank in the context of the international financial crisis that has been taking place in several waves over a year ago.
According to the decision taken early Sunday morning, the three States will buy approximately half (49 percent) of the Bank's property in their area.
The Bank will certainly sell a portion of its business, including in particular the activities - mainly insurance - purchased last year from ABN Amró.
Fortis shares began a sharp decline last week and by the second half of the week there were already signs of a major crisis in the institution.
However, analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees this bank is too big to allow itself to fail.
The company's shares fell 12 percent on Friday alone, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two thirds.
Looking at current share prices, the total market value of the group's capital is around 14 billion euros, but according to the company's executives this is not real.
The Bank's management attributed the sharp drop in Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the US market in relation to the approval of the US $700 billion package.
On Monday, the shares already showed a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new CEO.
The Bank also sought private investors, but so far no one has made a concrete offer.
The Belgian government had previously assured investors that they would not have to worry, they would not lose their money.
Among the Bank's customers so far there has been no panic, they have not invaded the bank offices to withdraw their money.
Fortis has its own branch in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Fox in the henhouse
In the United States, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract when they see data on drug purchases.
Privacy policy experts fear that the market for personal data will become uncontrollable.
'There are personal data protection programmes which link the use of prescription data in all cases to the approval of the person concerned.
It must be in independent hands, because otherwise, "we'll trust the fox with the chicken coop", says Richard Dick, designer of the medical prescription tracking program.
Insurance companies make the price of insurance and the amount of compensation dependent on the health status of the client and if they think the risk is excessive, they simply don't make the contract.
Before they sent the client to a medical check-up and signed the contract with him knowing the result of the check.
Dick invented a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: with the customer ID number he can easily get the pharmacies list of medicines purchased in the last year and a half and the program itself draws conclusions about the patient's illness and health.
For example, if you systematically take large doses of cholesterol-lowering pills, it indicates that your blood fat level is practically incurably high, so you are immediately placed in a higher risk category.
There are numerous versions of the programme in circulation, some even setting a risk number, so the insurance company besides the administration has little to do, although there are minor difficulties in this regard.
Among the disadvantages of the programme is that some medicines are multi-use, for example certain substances are used both for headache and heat waves and even as antidepressants.
The latter is a major risk-increasing factor for insurance companies whereas the former are not.
Special companies were set up to consult and process this data, which before acquiring the necessary information from pharmacies, ask for the patient's approval.
The authorities already force them to do this, although they have not received a fine for the negligence so far.
Some companies have also recently been working on lab test results and combining them with drug use data to obtain more accurate information about the patient's health status.
More and more companies have access to this data and simultaneously it is increasingly difficult to control its use.
There is a unique law for the protection of personal health data, but it applies only to insurance companies and healthcare providers.
The bill that gives authority to control companies specialized in providing personal data is already before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is insufficient: he therefore developed his programme, which will require the specific approval of the person for the provision of his own personal data.
It is another matter that the person cannot deny his approval, because otherwise the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the hens, after all, are exposed to the fox's good will.
The overall menu of Marseille
The European Union doubles its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually trade partners, this issue along with other mainly global problems dominated the agenda of the ninth summit.
A Franco-Indian summit will also be held today, mainly on cooperation in nuclear energy.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a major developing democratic power that should have more voice and voice in international affairs, member countries have not yet been able to reach a common denominator on whether they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
This question has not been addressed at the ninth summit launched yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the EU, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Javier Solana, the chief foreign policy officer, welcomed Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of India, with whom they reached an agreement to double their trade over five years, i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an overly ambitious objective.
The 26 existing bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have thus been legally harmonized, so that air transport can also fly in the future.
India intends to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is balance, because while the EU is India's leading trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among the Union's trading partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
Both sides condemned the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and terrorism - all forms of terrorism - and urged the convening of a UN conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also pressed, although both sides bear a heavy responsibility for its failure.
The EU has confirmed that it will stick to its energy and climate programme, meaning that it wants to reduce polluting emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agrees with this, as at next year's climate conference a global agreement should be reached and greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced by 50 percent by 2050.
They also wanted to prevent food prices from rising and supported the convening of an international conference to review the financial crisis.
Today the head of government of India will travel to the French capital, where he will - at a bilateral meeting - sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
Paris is confident that French companies will receive contracts worth 20 billion euros to build nuclear reactors.
According to news agency reports, the deal would be for a period of 15 years.
In Frankfurt more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt international book exhibition.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Exhibition is expected to attract more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 102 different countries, who will occupy the 171,790 square metres of the exhibition with more than 403 thousand titles on display and with Turkey as the guest of honour.
The Italian government will be represented by the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs Francisco Maria Giro at the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be present institutionally and effectively with a point Italy - 264 square metres of exhibition space.
A meeting with the printing press will follow in the Structural Room in the 5.0 hall of the Buchmesse: this will be the occasion to present figures, trends and prospects on the state of publishing houses in Italy.
According to the data, the weight of books by foreign authors is gradually decreasing over the total Italian production, particularly for adults and adolescents.
Found the plane of Steve Fossett the millionaire disappeared a year ago
The remains of the plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert have been found.
The debris has been found on a plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters in the Mammoth Lakes Nevada mountain range, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, there were no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson has dispelled the remaining doubts: "The plane has been located, we have sent a squadron, and now we have confirmation that it is the very thing Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared", he said at a press conference.
The sheriff has said no human remains have been found on the plane or in the vicinity.
The 63-year-old millionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (TSB) has announced that hours after the remains were spotted, a team of investigators has been dispatched to identify the apparatus: it belongs to the Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada, for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal remains have been found by a couple near his Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents with Fossett's name on them, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after he disappeared.
The millionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of firsts.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete a world tour in an air balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had made the world tour by plane and without stops.
Among his records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the publicity you didn't expect
An off-the-shelf SUV with an original and well-established design with defined lines and determined angles.
This is, in short, Glk the last born among the "compact" SUVs of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a window of novelty in this sector.
Due to the content outside the traditional, it will be unexpected and unconventional, the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition halls from next October 17.
The advertising campaign that accompanied the debut of the new car launched an unprecedented mode of communication through a 3D advertising campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project with maxi-posters, articulated in three different phases, which dominated the central shopping street of Milan, Como Avenue, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic version and thanks to special glasses distributed on the avenue How will it be possible to see the new SUV in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, looking at the images will give the impression that the car is leaving the poster.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative technology Elumina8 the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, to be reconstituted in a single image.
No doubt Mercedes is trying to introduce something new to the stereotype of automotive communication with this advertising.
Will this formula capture the interest of future buyers?
It's clear who the Italian hooligans are.
In Triveneto, the ban on access to sporting events is being played.
But who are these 150-200 girls and boys that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" that has been following the Italian National for years and that until now, to tell you the truth, had never created too many problems.
And they'd never met the rival's fans either.
Group extraction is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
A small group (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Apulia have been added to these from Sofia.
They have three-color flags showing the city of origin of the militants: Saturday night they have been taken out so they cannot be identified.
They inspire English fans.
In Bulgaria they have found a group of real Nazi fanatics, the Levski.
Figc had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all with names already, so easily controllable.
And the interior minister had already controlled them all: among those who had left for Sofia there was none with a Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) at the time, none who had prohibited him from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans, who had a history of crime in stadiums, have been denied the ticket and also the trip.
The Ministry of the Interior is now hoping to read the acts coming from the Bulgarian police to take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo (ban on access to sporting events) for at least five years to fans who have been arrested or identified in the disorders.
A Daspo (ban on access to international sporting events) that prevents people from attending not only Italian stadiums but also those of the whole of Europe.
Our hooligans, they're not gonna set foot in a stadium anymore.
I'm glad you did.
But now there is the fear of imitation: that to those few fifty, others will be added.
"We must immediately put out this fire and not legitimize who behaves in this way", they say from the Ministry of Interior.
That is why we are "very open-eyed" especially in view of Wednesday's National match in Lecce.
In Apulia there is also a small core of supporters of Ultras Italia.
Tomorrow the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Cams which can also have a section of the Aise (information and external security agency, that is, the secret service, which deals itself with the problems in the stadiums.
"The chorus of Duce-Duce and the arm raised during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought (expressed in a less than happy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks now the director of the Observatory of the interior ministry (he has taken the position that was previously Francesco Tagliente's and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had been head of public safety in Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate the Duke but yes, the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist  adds the Observer's n.1  the crimes are attributed to the countries in which the event takes place.
So far this group has behaved well, so we will see what has happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But let's also talk about whistles to the hymn of Mameli: those too are not a crime, but if they allow it they are not educational either".
