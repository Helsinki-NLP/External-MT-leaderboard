The Russian Federation FASO will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Assessment of the effectiveness of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings the agency will hold throughout the year, according to a press release received by "Lenta.Ru".
The third meeting is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for evaluating the results of scientific organizations.
The participants of the event plan to discuss separately the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events to form a single approach to the methodology of evaluating the results of scientific organizations for all three academies.
We've done that over the last five months, and the final version of the regulatory documents is in the process of being agreed.
According to the results of the next session, we should complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and terms of the evaluation", - said the head of the expert-analytical department of the Russian Federal Aviation Administration Elena Axenova.
Representatives of more than a hundred Russian scientific institutions will take part in the event.
A resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow, Solanka Street, 14.
Scientists have found a way to find their star relatives
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz, have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
The discovery is expected to allow researchers to search for related stars, which are from the same cluster.
The authors published their findings in the journal Nature, and a brief review of the findings can be found on the university's website.
The reason for the similar chemical composition of nearby stars is the turbulent mixing in the gas clouds that preceded the formation of stars.
Even if the newborn star leaves the cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of its relative stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of its relatives in the cluster.
The results of the astrophysicists' simulations show that such differences should not occur.
In their study, the researchers used a supercomputer to simulate two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
Over millions of years, this object under its own gravity transforms into a cluster, where protostars begin to form.
The scientists added markers to the initial gas streams and found that the rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
Astrophysicists believe that their research proves that it is possible to look for relative stars by their chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carruthers police arrested a 20-year-old man after he chased a motorcycle at high speed .
The motorcycle was impounded after it was driven at 125 km/h in the 70 km/h speed limit zone and through bushlands to evade the police in Pilbara.

Lavrov: Russia will not "knock on the door" in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not "knock on the door" because of the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of the Moscow State Institute of International Studies.
As for our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, because everything must be calculated in concrete terms, he said.
And once we understand what our European and American partners will agree to this time, then we will decide how to respond.
This will not be connected with knocking on doors, some kind of offense, misunderstanding, - the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, base ourselves on our interests, on the interests of protecting our economy, our social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners on their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
The steps taken in the field of sanctions can be very good to judge what the partners are trying to achieve, - continued the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
If they say loudly that "they will be painful for us too, but we have to go for it to punish Russia", that's probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of Russia in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO's tools, including when it comes to trade disputes, - Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU's discriminatory policy on anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time anti-dumping measures are applied against the sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the mechanisms of the WTO and to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively", Lavrov said.
How to use mercury in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the following questions:
Since the mermaid loses its main attractiveness after blooming, it is desirable to plant it with other shrubs.
It blends perfectly with many cultures.
Besides, you can and should plant ornamental plants in other seasons and flowers at the same time.
Another advantage of sirens is that they provide a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can shape it into a stem tree of varying height, an improved shrub, a broad-based shrub, and even a garden bonsai-like tree with a curiously curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that best fits your garden design.
A resident of Leningrad region convicted of selling fake money
According to the republican Interior Ministry, the man engaged in his criminal trade in Olonets and Segeg districts.
He committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already succeeded in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared in the Olonetski District Court.
And to finish the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, was staged in Segej.
The investigation has proven her guilty of several instances of counterfeit money sales dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case was sent to court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the four-year sentence with a general-security prison.
The sentence has not entered into force.
Recall that last week, two more people were convicted for selling counterfeit money in the shops of Petrozavodsk.
Azerbaijan citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One of them is serving five years, the other four.
Each is fined 500 thousand rubles.
The sentence has not yet come into force.
In Arkhangelsk, the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish" was celebrated
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish supplied the USSR with military aid from the United States and Great Britain.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov embankment in Solombal.
The event was attended by representatives of the Arhangelsk veterans' organizations, children from the cadet class.
The first time we met was 23 years ago, when the cornerstone was laid.
But at the same time today's event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance of those who were not returned by the sea", - said the chairman of the board of veterans of the Northern Sea Navigation Boris Karpov.
Then the city's wind orchestra performed, and the cadet class gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the flags of Russia and the Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers at the pledge stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategically important raw materials (10 000 tons of rubber, 1500 tons of formwork boots, tin, wool and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, the ships were equipped with military equipment and armaments - 3,800 depth charges and magnetic mines, and fifteen Hurricane fighters, all in disassembled condition.
The convoy was escorted by 16 British Navy ships, including two aircraft carriers.
The convoy was not detected by the enemy and reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the vital operations, 126 transport and about 50 warships were lost.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that would protect the organization of unions as a civil right.
"Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs", says Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is a co-chair of the Progressive Caucus.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Extension of Workers' Rights Act alongside the symbol of the civil rights movement, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal rights to discriminate against trade unions as it does against other forms of discrimination, while stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
Amending the Labor Relations Act to allow workers facing discrimination for union membership to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation and fines - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis, and the co-authors of the bill are proposing is to recall a very American idea.
Despite the attacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country - Americans once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding, and respecting labor rights.
There was a time, remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country pass a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions play a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, and to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations for the purpose of protecting and improving labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to restrict this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these ends will be declared unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairwoman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a world treaty in 1948, Roosevelt and the framers included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to protect his interests".
For generations, Americans have taken it as a basic tenet that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize unions - and to have those unions participate as equal partners in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is indeed wise to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living for millions, unions have miraculously created a market for industry and lifted an entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade union organisations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that historically enlarged America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the passage of a Louisiana law that his supporters say will likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginald in June and was scheduled to go into effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have a license to see patients in a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that for now, doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while continuing to seek such authorization.
"The plaintiffs will be permitted to operate legally while continuing the proceedings for their authorization", Judge John deGravells wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be scheduled within the month in which the judge will render a more permanent ruling under this law.
Abortion rights advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get hospital authorization.
"Today's decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to take away their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to halt the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to doctors from the two clinics, who were not plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admission powers.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed such laws, and courts recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a Texas law that would have shut down most of the remaining clinics in that state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that the laws on admission authority impose medically unnecessary restrictions on doctors.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights reports.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticising the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission authority await a decision.
What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products lead to ?
At least half of the products in the range of trade networks should be Russian, says Oleg Nilov, a member of the State Duma from the "Justiceful Russia" faction.
The parliamentarian has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible inconvenience to the buyers.
For the rest of the products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic producers", - Nilov told the publication.
Along with amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced rate of VAT of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in retail chains is part of a package of incentives for Russian manufacturers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Taxman", member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industry, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
The plus is farmers, small shops.
They'll be able to sell more, which means that the profits will increase.
They will also have the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, who will be forced to buy their products.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activity and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
It will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will develop faster, it will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately", the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into local shops due to the high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, with the embargo, that niche is free and we can breathe a sigh of relief.
But we should not forget that after all the necessary harmonization and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now is the "silent moment", when the old players have left and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in the prices of ready-made products", - told Aif.ru the first Vice-President of the Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", Tamara Kasyanova.
The idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will definitely help to secure the sector to local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that are cheaper due to subsidies from another state.
In other words, the battle for the buyer will be between companies operating under the same industry laws.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian producers are not able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots in all articles.
And in this situation, the retail chains will have to "pull" the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
This has led to growing concerns that poor-quality goods will be sold.
Perhaps foreign products with broken labels will be delivered under the guise of products produced in Russia", the expert adds.
The negative impact of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trade networks, especially those which are more profitable in cooperating with importers.
It is logical that foreign suppliers would suffer as well, since demand for their products would decline.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may also affect consumers.
The fact is that some Russian-made products may be inferior in quality to imported counterparts, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was revived by economists in February this year due to the ruble's continuing devaluation.
Now, in the face of the difficult relations with the West, the question of abandoning imported products is even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers to consider domestic manufacturers when forming orders for suppliers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time", - says deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective in those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where imports accounted for 25%.
Our farmers are actually capable of completely filling the shelves of Russian stores.
Meat production could also be given a boost.
As you know, the largest share of imports remains in beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% of the production is still Russian", - says Kasyanova.
Experts believe that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will facilitate import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko believes.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps will be taken in this direction.
It is not enough to set quotas, we must also establish domestic production in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide just such guarantees", the expert states.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more than in urban areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have released a video in memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who practice abortion in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those who live in urban areas.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, and found that only 35 percent survived five years after the diagnosis.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that those living in the regions and remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
NEW RESEARCH: New drugs may slow down lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers tracked the women's medical trajectory over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current illnesses, and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had advanced cancer at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
Those who lived in the regions or remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside of urban areas are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"The best way to treat this disease is by surgeons who specialize in gynecologic oncology, and they are mostly in big cities", she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of out-of-home services, which will allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people receiving treatment far from their home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Neve, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September , a new FAP will open in the Kujener district
The construction of the medical facility in Toktaybelak village was started in April this year and was carried out according to a model project.
The cost of the works amounted to a little over 10 million rubles.
According to the public relations and information department of the Mari El Head, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built treatment and prevention facility is almost 230 square meters.
The medical assistance will be provided to residents of eight settlements: Toktaybelik and Dementiev villages, Pyuncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibelyak, Shinnur and Chashkayal.
The new field-acupuncture center will replace the existing FAP, which was built in 1918 and has long since exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet the sanitary-hygiene requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
The woman who killed her four-month-old son in a state of drunkenness will be tried
A woman from Chuvashia is about to be convicted of murdering her own child.
In Cheboksary, the investigation of the criminal case against the 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by carelessness, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 this year, the accused came to Cheboksary with her four-month-old son to celebrate the birthday of her godmother's child.
After a long feast, the novocheboksar decided to stay and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up in the night and cried, the sober woman laid him on the bed next to her to breastfeed, but he soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, a woman fell on her son, causing him to die of asphyxiation.
The criminal case, the press service of the SCR in Chuvashia, has been sent to court.
Inflation is out of the holiday.
Will Russians feel the price rise
As a result of cross-border sanctions imposed by Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit into the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast by the Ministry of Economic Development, inflation will be 6.5-7.5% in 2014, and even lower - 6.5% next year.
However, according to the Kommersant, the IED should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast for 2017 this week.
According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in the income of the population.
The forecast suggested that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation would be in effect for a year - until August 2015.
How could inflation be expected to be so high in such a situation?
The current situation suggests a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change", the newspaper's source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists at VTB Capital do not share the government's financial-economic bloc's expectations regarding inflation and predict price growth of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will come together with the possible introduction of sales tax (STS) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
The inflation peak of 9% will fall in February, after which the annual price growth rate will decline, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat released the first inflationary results since the Russian Federation imposed "accurate sanctions".
AI.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of AForex FC:
Prices are already rising in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, as socially significant products became more expensive, the government was forced to launch systematic monitoring of price stability to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting to regulators on a daily basis so that authorities know exactly who, when and why is initiating price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the huge capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population to foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food goods from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures were kept under control, the cost of a basket of minimum-nutrition items would not have jumped 12% in just one quarter.
The ban on food imports triggered a supply shock on the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism at the current stage, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry the risks of an inflationary component.
If you add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, inflation may well exceed 8% by the end of this year.
Alexander Razuvaev, director of the analytical department of "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, and in the zero years it was also higher than the current level, another thing that was then offset by rapid economic growth.
I think by the end of the year, inflation will be 8 to 8.5%.
Platon Maguta, asset manager of the Maguta Fund
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is being successfully contained for now, but if there is further pressure, primarily on the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in the purchase of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It is possible to assume that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the price increases traditionally start after the summer slump and may become more pronounced this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to hold, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are suffering from a decline in homeownership
This drop, driven by the exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could lead to gardening centres losing tens of millions of pounds a year when today's young consumers reach "the prime age of gardening", according to a study by the HTA, reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, renters spend an average of 55 percent of what homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting front yards for parking and shrinking garden sizes as other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to have annual sales of £5 billion.
Greater London, where homeownership has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, has the lowest level of spending on garden products per household in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society have reported that renting housing and not having a garden space does not mean people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: "Containing plants, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move".
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail gardening goods as a result of increased homeownership and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year thanks to better weather after the adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a massive clean-up in the "Groundwork" fund
Three of the four heads of the Landfill Fund were replaced on Friday.
In all, three of the four heads of the Landscape Fund were replaced as early as Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture reported only the removal of Atanas Dobrov from the post of executive director.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasilova.
It turned out that two of the three deputy executive directors of the foundation were quietly replaced on Friday.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper "Tруд".
I was not present at the board meeting because we are not members of the board, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I can't tell you why my dismissal isn't posted on the foundation's website.
I'm on vacation. I'm going to the hospital.
I hope to learn more on Monday", Angelova told the newspaper.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who was until now the head of "Investment lending" at the central fund in "Earthworks" in Sofia.
Deputy executive director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until now, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the "Zhemelediye" fund in the city of Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the foundation Atije Aliyeva-Veli retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
Official reasons for all the changes at the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls in an American diplomat over a report of espionage
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country for clarification regarding the report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US envoy and Turkish officials discussed the message on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority target for US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of this report, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that the main German intelligence agency had also made Ankara a target of intelligence, provoked an even more angry response from the Turkish government.
China 's biggest companies have banded together against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China's largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networking, messaging, etc.) and Baidu (China's largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
But catching up with the Chinese internet miracle, which has outpaced even its American rivals eBay and Amazon.com, will be difficult.
The Union of the Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, with Wanda owning 70 percent and 15 percent each of the internet companies, according to Wanda Group.
The company is planned to be registered in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu's search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and the Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, the Wanda Group manages at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year , the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $ 8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and a theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring in $ 960 million in revenue.
Wanda also owns the American movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings, making it the largest movie theater operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its shopping malls, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created rival Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will lead the new company, the merger will increase Wanda's e-commerce user base from 40 million to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world's largest online-to-offline platform, Dun Tse said.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online shoppers to come to the regular offline stores or to purchase other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest cake in online commerce", said Wanda's head, Wang Jianlin (quoted by Bloomberg).
"There is no real O2O platform in China right now, and in this situation, everyone has about the same chance", he believes.
China's e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates that its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, according to official statistics from Bloomberg, more than any other country in the world, except India.
And by 2015, that number is projected to grow to 850 million.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huateng was until recently the richest man in China, but according to Bloomberg's billionaires index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma's net worth is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu CEO Robin Lee is currently ranked third among China's richest people, while Wanda's Wang Jianlin is ranked fourth.
"It's an interesting battle to watch: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer", said Cao Lei, director of the China Center for E-Commerce Research in Hangzhou, according to Bloomberg.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to compete with Alibaba in earnest once it's established: "Rome wasn't built in a day".
It is not easy to compete with Alibaba not only for new companies but also for the world's established leaders in online commerce, according to Alibaba's latest quarterly financial report.
Alibaba is often described as something between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost double the similar sum of competitors - it has grown almost three times year-on-year and amounted to $1.99 billion.
"Alibaba still has a huge money-generating potential, in large part thanks to its mobile apps", commented an analyst from Hong Kong's Arete Research Service on the Bloomberg report.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's website, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July was 188 million, significantly higher than the March figure of 163 million.
And 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba is going to announce the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts polled by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of the shares.
According to Bloomberg, Alibaba's debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is likely to take place on September 16.
The company's road show preceding the event will kick off on September 3.
Alibaba's IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE history and will raise about $20 billion.
Until now, the record for the amount of funds raised on U.S. exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held its initial public offering, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food in the retail chains should be Russian-made, state Duma deputies say.
They've drafted a bill on that.
The amendments are to article 8 of the Federal Law "On the basis of state regulation of trade activity in the Russian Federation" and to the Tax Code.
The document's goal is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification is that according to the bill, at least 50 percent of the products produced domestically in stores should be for each type of product.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for all food products whose country of origin is Russia, reports the newspaper "Izvestiya".
On August 27, the bill to amend the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was introduced in the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive in Russia the farmers' markets, where small producers can sell their products.
Police Chief Magaluf charged with corruption
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvia municipal officials to the Mallorca State Prosecutor's Office on Friday.
The police chief of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca has been arrested following allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious Magalufe drinking hotspot.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was placed under arrest as a result of corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and Calvia municipal officials to the Mallorca anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two more local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say the protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about surviving", one businessman told the court.
We must not jeopardize our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British vacationer making a pass at 24 men during a bar run.
The island's authorities have since been trying to stop the drunken hooliganism among Magaluf holidaymakers by minimizing the number of notorious bar-running.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the Carnage bar run organizers were jointly fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous drunken accidents involving the madness of the fun known as "balconying", where people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring was marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
A COLD summer has arrived in the south of South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5mm of rain fell on the city tonight at 9pm, following the 6.6mm that fell on Sunday night.
The latest rain was preceded by a couple of short downpours with strong winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and dropped nearly 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave off an early portion of spring last week, temperatures dropped again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The excellent conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the boarding of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land just after 7:30 p.m., but it got into a wind shift zone - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and was forced to take altitude.
Wind gusts were up to 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including the Emirates flight from Dubai and the Qantas flight from Sydney.
Highs in Adelaide are forecast to be 16C on Tuesday with a chance of one or two rains.
Construction estimates in Russia will be calculated in a new way
The Federal Antimonopoly Service has a special oversight of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, and networking.
The FAS has created an expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector.
At its meeting, the head of the Housing and Communities Administration, Construction and Natural Resources Control Department of the FAS Vadim Solovyov stated that "today's calculation of the construction facilities' estimate is absolutely incomprehensible".
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unjustified construction costs, the FAS believes.
And they propose that the cost of building public property at the design stage should be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the current estimates and single estimates for technological operations.
These proposals are on the roadmap and are currently under consideration at the Ministry of Construction.
"The replacement of traditional construction estimates with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry", Vadim Solovyov explained to RGB.
Because the estimate now includes every bolt and nut, and it is not always possible to check everything, sometimes unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors" in the documentation.
The Ministry of Defense and FAS agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of cost by structural elements are already there: methods have been developed for calculating prices for structural solutions, compiling estimates according to these indicators, - told "RGB" the head of the department of urban planning and architecture of the Ministry of construction Elena Zhukova.
Road construction is selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
According to the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko, the estimated standards are long outdated, but no other mechanism is offered to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, in practice this is difficult to implement, since the construction of buildings often uses completely different technologies", he believes.
It's no secret that the construction industry is developing largely thanks to a state order.
According to the chairman of the board of the National Enterprise "Expert community of professionals of state order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most payable customer.
Deputy Director for Engineering of the Rosatom Capital Construction Branch Center Vladimir Malachov pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is as much as possible protected from someone's controlling influence.
The expert council proposed to form a state order system in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts for the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to assign the customer with the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff of the customer and budgetary expenses for its maintenance.
The experts of the customer must have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work carried out by the contractor and its safety.
Often, this will require determining who is responsible for the overall security of the facility.
In addition, this approach may lead to an outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement due to the lack of interest in receiving a public order for an incomplete volume of works and a small amount of the contract.
Alexander Yevshashenkov, deputy head of the expert consultation center of the Institute of procurement, believes that the procedure of the state order has now turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "the participant must indicate "specific indicators" when filling out the application without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analog", "or", "type", "similar type", "not lower", "lower", "higher", "can", "may have", "may be", "earlier", "not earlier", "not higher", "not allowed" etc.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the contract applications submitted by the contracting entities.
Another problem of 44-FZ, according to Yevstashenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work through the "paper" proposal of the participant at the stage of submitting the application.
When considering the participant's application, one can really assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not even been started yet, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert council also proposed moving marginal income from the top to the bottom echelon to eliminate intermediate contractors.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, the Secretary of State, the Deputy Head of the FAS, Andrei Tsarikovsky, believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
Or it'll be like the famous reprise of Arkady Rykin's "The Atelier": "Do you have any complaints about the buttons?"
Israeli children return to school after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children in the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mines rained down on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-hit settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, the staff of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a missile, removed the traces of debris from the walls and children's shelters before the arrival of the students.
"We are a little scared, but we are looking forward to the future", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher at his school.
A lot of kids in our neighborhood really need to get back to a normal life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said that suddenly going back to school was "a little weird".
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't leave our homes at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited a kibbutz near the Gaza border to express his support.
Before a ceasefire agreement halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad were either not outdoors or left their homes to move to safer areas beyond the Gaza Strip to escape missile and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old Palestinian boy was killed by a shell of a landmine, are questioning whether they should return.
The Ministry of Education says about a dozen families have not returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for that time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a town on the border with Gaza that has suffered greatly from Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study hard and said: "We will do everything we can to educate you and to keep you safe".
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately ended hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for lifting the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and opening airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers who died in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rocket and mine rounds at Israeli cities, mostly in the south.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, conducted more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found shelter in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in shelters and fighting raging, education officials last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education, like children all over the world and Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of the schools in Gaza.
According to the popular benchmark, real estate prices have shown the biggest winter increase in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This growth resulted in a combined increase of 4.2 percent for June, July, and August, the largest increase for the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the growth in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data's research director, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that in Sydney, house prices have risen by 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne, they've risen by 11.7 percent.
The next largest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was overtaken by government spending cuts, where prices rose by just 1.4 percent a year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale over the next few months, which will be a "real test" for the market.
"Given the current high level of auction speed, overall high speed of sales and current low interest rate conditions, it is likely that housing prices will rise further over the next three months", he said.
How people live in the oldest house in Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Large Kazan) 18 apartments.
The 18th-century house has remained virtually unchanged since its construction, except for its age.
Strangers come here as if on a tour, and the residents suffer more than they enjoy, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest house in Ufa, whose walls are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is not exact, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But anyway, it turns out the building is no less than 300 years old.
The old yard, the open door, the creaky stairs.
The doors are close together, the walls are cracked, and the plastered walls give the street a view.
I think we're on the same page.
And the locals say, "You don't think it is, it's true".
Living in a wooden house from the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatyana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
It's a state property, but the money hasn't been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the government has forgotten about.
The last renovation was 40 years ago.
The walls are still holding up, but the foundation is rotten.
Many residents still use the outdoor toilet and bathe in the public bathroom once a week.
How can one be satisfied in such conditions?!
The road goes right under the windows, there's not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana is moving the curtain.
Now you can see what you could only hear before: a stream of cars floating under the windows.
You see, the windows are always cracking, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
Man is accustomed to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still a model, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
Plus, we have two rooms, three of us and a son.
Other families have much worse conditions, with ceilings on the second floor generally just over a meter and a half high.
For the contrast, Tatiana offers to visit the neighbor from apartment No. 6 Ludmila Starostina.
A pleasant, hospitable woman offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live like this: with my husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another living space - Ludmila looks around the room: an anthrax, two sofas with the letter "g"; one of them has a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But the ceiling is leaking regularly, so the plumbing system is no good.
Ludmila talks about her apartment as ordinary and surprising at the same time, like an Italian whose house stands on Roman ruins.
So it boils down to one thing that's very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was done about 40 years ago during the last renovation.
Then they built us a little backyard kitchen and a toilet out of the old shola.
We live right where Demidov and his family lived, the servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The real estate department in Ufa says privatization is irrelevant.
We'll only get a one-bedroom apartment anyway, we can't claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to move us out, but that's all they did.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
A whole dynasty lived in this apartment: my grandparents, my mother and father, my husband and I, and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, the big rats were running around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the flier, they're a meter thick!
They say the solution was mixed in the eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thanks to Demidov!
Probably just so nobody's killed by a collapsed ceiling or a fence.
But the building itself is slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and timbers of the houses are rotting, the floors have repeatedly failed, we poured cement over it, but all is useless - the solution goes into the ground like a well.
They say there is a secret passageway under our room and a passage to the White River, which was specially made by the Old Believers who once lived here, so that they could hide from danger, should anything happen.
They were being followed.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how a historian came to them, begging to begin excavations in the apartment.
And then convinced them to give them a place to live in exchange for his one-bedroom apartment on Oktyabr Avenue.
Ludmila refused the historian:
Where are the four of us going?
And here there's a small hope that they'll give us more space.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
The Elders never won anything, though.
Lyudmila's biggest dream is to have them relocated, and her daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter given a separate room.
So two families were given a two-room apartment instead of the not-so-magnificent ruins where two generations now live.
The cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, her large family lives in two cramped rooms, called flats, with a total area of 23 square meters.
There were seven of us, two children.
You can see the conditions.
The fabric falls off in pieces, as do the window frames, the kitchen walls and the rooms, and the holes in the walls.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
If you walk through the apartments of the oldest house in Ufa, you can see that the most fortunate of all were the Lavrentievs from apartment No. 4.
They're in the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
Room's 75 square feet, three people registered.
We live in the same rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing is, everything around me is cracking, falling apart, crumbling.
The neighbors must have told you!
The hardest part was the floors, the wooden boards rotted, the ground literally slipped from underneath our feet.
I put up the props, the wedges, the hall is still empty, and in the other room we're swinging, it's so shaky.
Alexander Dmitrievich can tell you more about the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov than any tour guide.
He treats the goldsmith like a relative, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagi and Uzanka factories built houses, cast cannons and bells, kept the Ural mines.
The heirs of the merchant estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof as history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around it stood wooden quarters for carriages, stables and guard houses, later demolished.
In 1968 they tried to move our house, but something stopped them...
The story repeated itself in 2014: they were offered new housing again.
We, as a team, gathered all the documents, went through the necessary instances, and suddenly we found out that the move to the apartments was postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore.
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to find out about the fate of the house.
The tenant was not accepted by the officials.
They sent it from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a piece of paper without a signature or a stamp: "The Ministry of Culture has no objection to the displacement of tenants".
I even had the feeling that our house had long since left the city plan, because it was number 57 first, then 57A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was torn down in the '70s.
"Russian planet" appealed to the head of the sector of information and analytical work of the land resources department of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of displacement of old housing.
I can't be held responsible for the actions of the government in the 1970s, but I do know that there was a plan at the time to demolish all the old houses, despite their historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, is being successfully implemented.
The tenants are soon to be moved to new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the Demidov House will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy, the architectural biennial is taking place, and the project "Old Ufa" is represented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the whole Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will have a proper look, corresponding to what they were before, three centuries ago.
Demidov's house is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, the government has decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, we can't do it on weekdays, because the city's too busy.
Vladimir Barabash promises to move people from the future museum in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same size as the current ones.
Just from another era.
In Primorye due to the thunderstorm started a forest fire
A dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire in the territory of the Hunting Forestry in the Pojar district of the Primorsky Krai.
The fire is being extinguished.
According to the KGSBU "Primorsky airbase", the conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy chief of the airbase:
The fire, which broke out in a difficult-to-reach area, was discovered by an observer pilot aboard an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
They're burning the wood left over at the old burner.
The strong swamp and slope of the area is more than 45 degrees, the absence of suitable for landing of fire-fighting platforms creates significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of the forces at the disposal of the airbase by the Mi-2 helicopter and the An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was discovered, 4 firefighters were promptly dropped off at the extinguishing site.
The main task of the specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the platform for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing equipment.
In the lunch area, 3 additional firefighters were delivered by helicopter to the Ohuntschi village.
As soon as the helicopter landing site in the fire area is ready, specialists will be transferred to the extinguishing site, according to the website of the Primorsky Krai administration.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you".
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Lips, which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
Henry, however, had to navigate some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, and Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get off your sister.
Get out of here!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, would go to pubs with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a punch in cricket.
I never talked to him like that.
He was this un-smiley guy in the corner who's been reading the paper most of my life.
Henry had recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to get a glimpse of what his life must have been like.
It's a little better now, but it's dark, smoky, the depths of the underworld's labyrinths with flashes of fire and smoke and piles of soot.
My dad would get in the bathroom and just lie there, and you'd hear him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to get away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he'd been doing this for years and years to earn a living for us, and I started to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood without parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, "I love you".
It wasn't until Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billie, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
With Don French.
Why shouldn't I be friends with her?
She 's a great mom .
They're still great friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Don's a good man.
Why shouldn't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got really, really well and I started having symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.
So I started doing some serious fitness, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's change in career trajectory is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been completely immersed in the theatre.
It was followed by "The Comedy of Errors", and then "The Fates" by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career at the age of 16 working in a factory.
A DJ noticed him parodying it on stage, and wrote about it in "New Faces".
His career in television began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time I was the only black parody/comedian on television".
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in the public eye, I had to learn how to be an effective joke-delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager had the rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "black-faced themselves", Henry found himself performing for five years.
My family didn't like it.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with crowds.
But what was "an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years", was also "a grotesque parody of black people".
Playing characters who both mocked and celebrated black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as, among other things, the chef Garrett Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
Commercials, documentaries, TV series and film roles took up the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv in 2008, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're pulling time or slowly turning it aside".
Next up was a series of Radio 4 documentaries called "What's Good About...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
You can't say I was taught that in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with tights and cabbage down the front.
So I was really afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, they said, "You have to try.
Don't say that until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of those words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello's last monologue for the documentary, and it caught on.
I got the feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been straightened.
"This is what it is, this is serious business, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read the play for months and months before we put it on.
And she succeeded.
It seemed like they were waiting for a disaster, and it didn't happen.
Soon we started "Comedy of Errors".
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, 'Oh, you've changed.'"
There was a technical glitch, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You'll have to work 10 minutes while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me said, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You're in a play, stay in the play".
Henry in The Gathering at the Dutchess Theatre
It was hard to learn the lyrics for "The Fable".
Panic is good, it strengthens the muscles.
It was well received, too, so it was like a sign from heaven saying, 'This is what you should do.'"
He says it, of course, in a BIG voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really like it.
I like being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the comic mindset - all the way through our conversation, he's interrupted by flashes of humor, where he starts and ends parodying.
I just decided not to work in a booth, because this whole instant reward thing from a room full of strangers, I think it's pretty dangerous.
If you keep trying to do that, it can lead to a dead end.
I do work on Apollo Live sometimes when I want to, but mostly I don't get the pleasure I used to.
I'm asking if he'll ever do another stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey, I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I like stories.
People like stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify 'invisible workers'
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people are still receiving salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has pledged to reduce corruption in government structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was lost to "invisible worker" payments and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow into bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the civil service, reports BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusuiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All civil servants must report to the identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure that their data is collected through biometric registration procedures, the government statement said.
Anyone who doesn't do so without good reason will be deleted from the payment ledger, it says.
"This procedure will significantly help streamline the public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clean up payroll at both levels of government - thus ending the problem of 'invisible workers,'" said Ann Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary for Planning and Structuring.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local news agencies report.
Police officials did not immediately comment on the information.
Among those arrested were 14 high-ranking officers, according to the Hurriyet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption-finding activities last December that targeted government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of organizing a criminal group and eavesdropping on phones.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and other in power, the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told the waiting reporters that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
All of Ukraine, the great united Ukrainian people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pashukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk's daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally settle here and that children will learn the knowledge that will be useful in their later lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rhona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the kind of impressive leader it needs.
Followed by a slew of fame from the world of banking, media management and the Tory inner circle.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at global management consulting firm Bain and Co, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and in the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when the top job at Pearson's parent company was taken over by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that she is earning close to £1 million.
Her political standing is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he was trying to bring private sector professionals to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband was Tory's former adviser.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned bowl.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two functions: inside as the top level of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outside as the voice of public concern and excitement when things go wrong.
It's an almost unattainable duopoly that requires complete radical reform.
But what new chairman would risk coming in, dismantling and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself were to lose his job in the process.
It's a difficult decision.
If it were not so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size, after reviewing its authority, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge comfortable old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of licensing pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest £145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in what is arguably the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC has a good story: it claims that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p a day.
Moreover, it's clear that Beeb's popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC's viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now get the headlines on my mobile phone and watch the missed shows on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs a big chair - I hope he's found it.
Perry of Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone outside
A tweet from Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry's confirmed account Sunday night contained an offensive image of the Democratic district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution for alleged abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, where the recording was deleted.
There was just a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I've removed it", a later recording says.
Perry's aides didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually involved in the publication of the tape.
An earlier tweet featured a mocking caricature of District Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her office when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The tweet read, "I don't always drive drunk, three times the legal blood alcohol level, but when I do, I blame Governor Perry for telling me so".
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Bureau did not conduct a grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge to dismiss the indictment, saying the law used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history will be unconstitutional.
Perry stopped funding of $7.5 million from state funds to the State Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and prosecutes corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto prompted a formal complaint from a left-leaning public control group.
Perry's verified account tape is updated frequently - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at the Iowa Party convention during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running alongside a lake and the words, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal"
One of London's most prominent developers warned that the real estate market in south-east England had "come back" to normal levels of activity.
Demand for homes in the capital has been high and prices have risen sharply, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose mortgage lending limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of elite construction firm Berkeley, said Monday: "Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to the normal level of transactions from its 2013 peak", adding that this has provided a "stable working environment".
London's property market prospered during the recession as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent last year alone, according to the Land Cadaster, significantly surpassing the 6.7 percent average for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes rose by about one-fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been held back by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "mansion tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tighter lending conditions, would also result in a decline in both market growth in property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting a further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, cut its 2015 London property price growth forecast to 3 percent based on the fact that the real estate price sentiment has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes, meanwhile, fell a quarter year-on-year in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, the demand for homes in the capital proved very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales to over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pijli added: "The demand for the right product with a good design and a better location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales have been maintained over time".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year through the end of April - almost a third more than at the pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual profit before tax rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to £380 million, income by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking before the company's annual meeting on Monday, Mr. Pijli said Berkeley's projected revenue for this year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, the profit before tax for the full year is expected to be £450 million.
The price of Berkeley stocks was £23.96 this afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Jennifer Lawrence 's nude photos were published online by a hacker .
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th annual Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claims to have a "catalog" of photos of 100 more rising stars.
A spokesperson for the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos are real, and condemned the hacker for "their brazen intrusion into private space".
A complaint has been filed with law enforcement, and they're going after anyone who publishes stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan were allegedly obtained due to a flaw in Apple's iCloud online storage system, and the alleged "catalog" of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It's unclear how many of these photos are authentic, though "Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone" star Winstead also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"For those of you who are looking at the photos I took with my husband a few years ago, alone at home, I hope you are proud", Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice from Nickelodeon's iCarly and Victoria the Winner denied that she was in the photos, writing on Twitter: "These so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, people.
Let me stop it in the womb.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesperson for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos, which are supposedly of her, are authentic.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which has garnered critical acclaim
They dissolved, or should I say dissolved, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes did she tell him he was too serious, too hard to communicate, too tense, too closed-minded, and maybe a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in himself.
He was a thorn, like a hedgehog, yeah.
The latest victim of this thorny spine was a little romance, from which he expected more than usual, a release from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a trembling frail beauty with ragged hair and a trembling heart from a northern island village even more remote and harsh than Port Royen.
She came south with an older companion whom Kevern considered her aunt, and the latter inherited a house in a dry but heavenly valley, joyfully called Paradise Valley.
No one's lived in the house for years.
The pipes were ticking, the spiders were sitting motionless in the baths, the slime left its mark on all the windows, sure that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds, resembling giant cabbage cats.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both scary and fascinating, with a garden full of secrets.
A look at the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was longlisted for the 2014 Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week .
Kevern and Eileen were sitting hand in hand in broken lounges among tall grass, enjoying a sudden warm spring day; they were both distractedly hooked up to a cheap console that was supplying the country with soothing music and soothing news, when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he recalled an old song by a long-forgotten black performer that his father liked to listen to while the curtains were down in the house.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on consoles.
They weren't banned -- nothing was actually banned -- they just didn't play them anymore.
They've been helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Public taste did what orders and regulations could never do, and just as people picked out the memoirs of rich people who grew up poor, the cookbooks and the romance novels, they picked out the ballads from all the music.
Caverns, enthralled by the day, began to play the imaginary piano and sing Eileen's big legs in a crude comic voice.
Eileen didn't know.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he told her, mechanically placing two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it came out of his mouth.
It started with a game they played when he was little.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start a word with a "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew it was what was expected of him, that's all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard of it.
Jazz was not played, either, although it was not explicitly forbidden.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There's only one "if" left in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same with wit.
His unpredictability got on people's nerves.
And jazz was a wit expressed through music.
Although he had reached the age of 10 without ever having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, which meant that every segment of it agreed with gratitude -- gratitude for those who were spared -- with the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent were well suited for entertainment and sports in temperament and physical characteristics - and they sang and ran.
The people from Indostan, who seem to have a natural talent for everything electronic, have taken it upon themselves to ensure that no family is left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was plumbing; what was left of the Greek diaspora was beating plates.
The Gulf and Levant migrants, whose grandparents didn't leave the country when what happened was happening, for fear of being accused of starting a fire, for fear that the fire would consume them next, opened restaurants with their hands and feet, and they didn't stand up and complain about their idleness.
To each according to his ability.
As she had heard only ballads before, Eileen found it difficult to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just sung to her could be set to music.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", said Kevern.
Except maybe for people with big feet.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of security.
No words could pass through the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Eileen didn't know what it was.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn't want to press two fingers to her lips again.
She already thought it was weird.
"He thought it was funny", he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, closing Kevern's eyes.
There was nothing in the whole world but a spear of her black hair.
Nothing he'd want to look at.
"Well, if you say so", she said, holding her own.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Are my legs too big?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you", but it was too soon.
"I like you because you have fat ankles", he tried to say instead.
I have this perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
His attempts at jokes often put him in awkward situations, because like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted to, too, Kevern.
Despite the kind eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the chair, flipping over the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
The wine was made from cassava, so the drunkenness couldn't be an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to shake like palm leaves in a storm.
"I like you because you're stupid", she said...
I don't like you.
He felt sorry for her, both for the excessive cruelty of his words and for the fear that appeared in her gaze when she resisted him.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She did not talk to him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he did not doubt that in basic ways she was like the ones here.
The same huge ice ocean came down on them both.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after what happened, if anything, than their ancestors, smugglers and vandals, were raging from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand at any woman who dared to refuse them or irritate them.
What are you, a fool?
They'd have shown her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
First they would kiss - kissing is now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console gave out was to kiss her first and then hit her.
Unnecessary detail, Cavern thought, because the kiss itself was already a hoax.
Eileen Solomons has shown him that he needs to leave.
He got up from the chair like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the top window she watched him leave, her companion a man who had taken the burden upon himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a little bit of compassion for him and for men in general, even though some of them were reaching out to her.
A man turned from her, with his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all fighting ability left him - why did she seem to know it so well if she could not remember any occasion, until today, when she had seen such a thing?
Another Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years or so before this, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, the informal public-mood monitoring service, produced a small report on the persistence of low and moderate levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decline, if not cease altogether, given the resources and efforts that were being put in to eradicate it.
"Much has been done and much is being done", she wrote, "to soften the innate aggressiveness of the men who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in these tangled branches and narrow hamlets of the country, where, despite the spires of churches hovering over fences, the gentle breath of human kindness has seldom been felt in all history.
However, some qualities are hard to eradicate.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions it engenders.
While the population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of obstacles overcome, and proclaims its strong belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, not only is the old cruelty still firmly entrenched in rural communities and urban settlements, but there are signs of new and vicious pranksters emerging in homes, workplaces, roads, and even playgrounds.
"You have the annoying habit of writing too much", said her scientific supervisor, after reading the entire report.
I think you should read less novels.
Esme Nussbaum has lowered her head.
I should also ask you, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer", Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
There's silence again.
"I ask", Luther Rabinovich finally said, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
We don't have any prejudice here.
We are servants of the people without prejudice.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, which are absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort results, like the ones you showed me.
It's obvious that you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "crude" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and vigor.
To continue to mourn what happened, if it ever happened, as if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vital force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around as Rabinovich spoke.
Behind his head, flamingo-pink LED letters repeated the advice that Ofnua had been giving the country for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, socialize, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talking is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand what you mean", Esme Nussbaum said quietly, making sure her scientific supervisor finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything except that we haven't been cured as effectively as we've been convinced ourselves.
What worries me is that if we're not prepared, we'll find ourselves repeating the mistakes that led to what happened, if at all.
Only this time we're not going to vent our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinovitz connected the tips of his fingers to the pyramid.
That gesture was supposed to mean endless patience.
"You're going too far", he said, "by calling 'mistakes' the actions our grandparents did or didn't do.
You're going too far when you say they've thrown their anger and distrust at the others.
A man in your position should not need to be reminded that in understanding the past, that is, in defending the present, we do not speak of "us" and "them".
There was no "us" and there was no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"Which, to be honest with ourselves", Esme dared to insert, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was bad or good, what's done is done.
That was then.
There's nothing more to say, we agree on that.
And just as you shouldn't blame anyone, you shouldn't excuse yourself if it's appropriate or if it can be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn
The past exists so that we can forget it.
If I may add one word to that,
The Luther Rabinovich pyramid has collapsed.
"I will consider your report", he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove off the sidewalk, as described by passersby, "in a fiery rage".
Coincidences are happening.
Lesotho army says coup was not planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
The army of Lesotho denied that the coup was planned to overthrow the government, saying that it was against the police, who were suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying the country's army had surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, claiming he had received an assassination threat.
Army spokesman Major Ntelle Ntoyi said there was no coup, but that the army was responding to threats from "political fanatics" whom the police were trying to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements within the police force that are actually planning to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were ready to create chaos", he told VOA.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the army's actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized power by force, according to all reports, the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho at the moment have the main signs of a coup", he said.
The army of Lesotho said that soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and that the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjhoa Metsing is running the government in Tabane's absence.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions over disagreements in his united government.
He claimed that his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.

The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the next few hours for a medical examination.
He only played three times for the London club last season.
Recall that earlier, Milan had hired from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Production in the euro area at lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the euro area manufacturing sector's business activity index (PMI) on Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders were delayed and businesses were hit amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values came in ahead of Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will expect the bank to come up with a clear plan for dealing with the stalling of the eurozone recovery and the threat of deflation at a mere 0.3% inflation.
There is speculation that ECB head Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and US during the financial crisis.
"While some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on manufacturers is becoming more apparent", said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany's manufacturing sector, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to be a real concern, as does Italy's weakening from stable growth to stagnation.
Signs that growth momentum is fading in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, are also not adding to the confidence", said Mr Dobson.
The slowdown in industry is likely to fuel the fire of analysts who expect additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August study of the euro area manufacturing business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing".
He added: "Eurozone producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions - especially related to Russia/Ukraine - add uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business - and especially the consumer confidence - and is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it "more and more seems" that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, "although we suspect it will be limited".
Mariupol residents will set a live chain against the militias
Mariupol was quiet until last week - no one was keen to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting for the arrival of the "militants" with horror.
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which was not yet part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupol people decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would protect them, but it has little strength against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and decided to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
On Saturday evening, several thousand people arrived at the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the national anthem of Ukraine.
They're going to do the same thing in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and load equipment and food, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
The city is gradually closing shops, banks and ATMs.
Ten years of hell for the Beslan survivors: ten years since the terrible takeover of the school, how the children who ended up in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day test that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated their deaths during the school shooting.
Exactly ten years after the horrific takeover of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, kidnapped and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like something of the extreme possible evil.
The tragedy united East and West in disgust, which then miraculously grew into action and hope for the future in the midst of the heaviest grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who had cheated their deaths during the school shooting.
We found amazing young people who endured adversity, even though the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their best hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl in the picture trying to climb back into the gym under fire
She is captured in a photograph by the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when she was trying to climb back into a shelled sports hall in one of her underwear after a mine explosion.
In her confusion, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
There were fears that they were both dead, but in fact they survived.
"The woman told me to run as hard as I could, but I couldn't", Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and I went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need another operation.
I've got a few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people the way the doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't break it", she says with a challenge.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember all those who stayed.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Djera Gapoeva, was murdered there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, although the memories fade a little every year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we've received from people in the UK and around the world.
When I see a picture of me standing in a school window on the Internet, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn't happen again.
The boy who ran through a hail of bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
He was seven years old, and he said, "My mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand".
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the road, grabbed her hand and ran through the hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with leg injuries, thinking her son was dead.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (now defunct News of the World), where he was awarded the title of Child Protector by the Barnardo's Foundation by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it", he said yesterday.
I can tell you, though, that I have a faint memory of him.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to that gym, but I'm not thinking about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard, and they never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We're saying they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to pick whatever I wanted, and the ride in the open-top car.
But now he's worried about places like Ukraine, where wars have led to the kind of grief he and his friends have experienced.
That horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors", said Damir, who volunteered at a women's convent last week.
I want to help so badly.
I want to be a police officer someday, and I hope to be accepted into the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were murdered in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence right after the seizure, there were just no kids screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She remembers her trip to London with Damir vividly.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how people on the other side of the world could understand our feelings, could provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I would love to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters at the restaurant, and Damir was shooting at them with his water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I still think this world hasn't gotten any better in the last 10 years.
There's a war going on in Ukraine right now, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like us.
I think for a lot of people, war is just a news report that they listen to when they're bored or when they're busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up to be a very soft and calm boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
He's not looking for revenge, like, he's not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close with six of their classmates, and they go to the gym every once in a while and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember him throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, and Damir is 17 years older than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can't believe that for a few hours I was so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked around and saw hell all around me with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and ran.
That's how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgi Ilyin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after capture became the defining image of the Beslan tragedy.
Grave: Beslan survivor Georgi Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and right Georgi today
There was a scar of fear on his bloody face as he narrowly escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the head doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists stormed the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmares", she recalled.
Not exactly alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only my George survived.
The closer that date is, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't feel like it was long ago, I think it was yesterday, some of the scenes of those days are still in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
It's heartbreaking: George's photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in a sculpture (right)
I remember George was so eager to go to school that day, he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there's even a sculpture of George crying in San Marino.
George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it's hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that with this picture, people all over the world feel our pain.
George now says: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating these tragedies and they never know the truth.
They're investigating the crash of a Boeing in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
"I can't understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does this happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
It takes decades to forget her for a while.
It affected my health, and I still feel it.
I had nightmares about the seizure for about three or four years, but now it's better.
I went back to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That's why I keep going to this gym every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to walk into a gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the Medical University in Vladivostok.
I'm going to study to be a cardiothoracic surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not gonna happen.
George Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a killer terrorist
Incredibly, Georgi Farniev was at the feet of the killer terrorist during the capture, but he managed to survive.
During the seizure, he was photographed in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a killer terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday", says Georgi, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer in the FSB but could not because of the damage to his health during the occupation.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say kids are easy to deal with bad events, but I have to say that's not true.
"In 2006, I was working with psychologists, and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
I wish I could forget.
In 2005, the following year, I walked into that gym again for the first and last time.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photograph.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with an open laptop photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is huge, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As far as my physical condition is concerned, I'm healthy.
I have to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I walk normally.
But my health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including the medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He's learning to treat all animals, from cats to cows.
He said, "I know I'll never tell my children about my experience.
It's not something that kids need to know about, and it's certainly not something they need to experience.
His 42-year-old mother, Marina, said: "The pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate her.
I know George won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there and I wasn't.
I was waiting for him at home and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he's back with me.
He's staying with us.
George is an adult now, but that nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so horribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He's had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't exercise.
I'd say he's 50% over the nightmare, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many of my friends and neighbors were killed during the occupation, and that only adds to my pain.
I've lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and it's the best gift God could have given me, but my heart aches for those who were killed.
I know families with new babies, but I know widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on even if you don't want it to.
I'll never forget the heartbeat I felt the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's going on in the world, wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
War is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we're at war now?
People and children are suffering, I'm sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If we could just grab all the rebels and throw them as far away as we can.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years old
A baby that was moved to safety by a Special Forces soldier
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is being carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
She 's ten now (right), and she has no memory of the monstrous crime .
The world was taken by surprise in 2004 when a Russian police officer carried little Alyona out of a school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christine, and brother Mahar in the school gym.
Mahar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister were killed in the massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they and his new wife Svetlana have a young daughter, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alyona, now ten, has no memory of the abduction and has blossomed into a bright and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They're a big happy family now, and Alyona and Mahar are both beautiful children", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
It's understandable why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia, said he is looking forward to playing in the German club's uniform.
He said this transfer was a career highlight.
Of course, I am very happy to play for Borussia again", Kagawa was quoted as saying by Bild.
I feel really good.
I'm full of positive emotions and I'm looking forward to being able to play in the Borussia again.
It should be noted that Kagawa moved to MU from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to establish himself in the English club, having played only 38 matches in the English championship over two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 effective passes.
Man charged with running over girl at Pelican footbridge in Fife
A 78-year-old man is due to stand trial on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at the Pelican footbridge in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit a girl at the Pittenweene crossing in East Newick.
Prosecutors have stated that Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and hit a girl, resulting in an injury.
Stuart, 78, of Anstruther, pleaded not guilty in Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the king's counsel, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande are not going to Vladivostok.
The Duty Free shop at Vladivostok airport has put up a sign banning a number of world political leaders from shopping there.
Not to give them spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store's management decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President François Hollande, Vitaliy Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other prominent comrades would not be able to purchase vodka, brandy and spirits in their store.
And I put a sign on the door.
Obama was previously banned from visiting the MGU Dietary Dining Room, which is even less accessible to him, the catering site reported.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet diner in Russia is unknown, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves to be terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies to establish the production of cheese varieties that are in demand among buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the "Yugpticeprom" company of the firm "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurants to refocus on Russian meat, which is of good quality.
A one-year embargo on food imports was introduced in Russia on August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team, Valentin Maslakov, is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All Sports" the words of Maslakov.
Third place is a confirmation of our high command.
It's nice to see the French and even the Americans' advantage over us is minimal.
We're not prepared for this competition.
The season is over, and we're not making our leaders participate in the DecaNation.
We've been runners-up in the last few years, but this season we've got a new team.
The French, on the contrary, put forward a fighting team, including 13 European champions.
They have made no secret of their intention to win this year, as they have repeatedly announced publicly.
But even this team of hosts couldn't resist the Americans.
So I think the Russians have performed well in such a representative company.
But the results in some species were a lot lower than in the same "Diamond League".
The season is over.
Of course, the results are not so important to athletes, especially in team-level competitions.
The place was the main thing.
And the results, I agree, it was absurd, when in the 1500m, the men were so obsessed with the tactical intricacies of the race that they showed a result below the average... of the women's races.
4 tips for better quality underwater photography and video
If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a whole range of equipment.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soap, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these photos at a family holiday with several cameras, all for about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow to get the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also, set your camera to the type of photos or videos you're going to take.
Some cameras have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, figure out how deep your equipment can go.
Some of the chambers are only five feet, others are 50 or 60 feet.
Take a look at our buyer's guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take some shots, because a lot of them don't work.
The "Whispers" have a GCD that helps you compose the images, whereas the action cameras don't.
Even if you have a water feature, it's hard to see underwater, and the framing is a random process.
So take some shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that takes multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The amount of light is reduced significantly the deeper you go underwater.
If possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It also allows you to convey more color in the photographs; the deeper you go, the less color you see.
Swim closer to the subjects.
That's great advice for shooting on land, but it's even more important underwater because of the dim lighting.
Especially important if you're shooting with an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you have to get close to the subjects if you want to fill in the frame.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in freestyle wrestling, Bilyal Makhov, may move to Greco-Roman wrestling.
This was reported by the head coach of Dagestan national team in free wrestling Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently Bilyal Makhov is in the squad of the "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sajid Sajidov.
In general, Bilyal played in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he won the freestyle tournament and was third in the Greco-Roman competition, and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
It's been said for a long time that the next phase of his career will be in Greco-Roman wrestling.
I'll tell you more: Makov can play at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the dressage.
But the decision is always up to the coaching staff headed by Gogie Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man whose strength of character could shake everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consultant anaesthetist, he has dedicated his career to relieving patients of both the suffering of disease and the agony of treatment.
Among those who approached him, his wife recalls, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson realized that while doctors are obsessed with diagnoses and diseases, those who are treated are primarily concerned with something else entirely - pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I didn't feel like I was", he wrote in May last year.
I had a hard time finding the strength.
As he struggled with flu-like symptoms, he found himself angrily blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I want it to happen sooner, not later", he noted.
When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found that he was unusually upset and unable to understand why.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
The X-ray results came back.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it's hard to pinpoint the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the cause was exposure to asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called "miracle" but is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when a recommendation for an industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was in use, only people in specific industries worked closely with it: pipe fitters, builders, carpenters, and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it's hardly a cause for concern today.
But such calm is wrong.
The UK, it turns out, is at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic today.
More people die here from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual number of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in the UK
The reason we're feeling its lethal effects now is that while asbestos use has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades to develop mesothelioma.
And mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and in many cases still is, a byproduct of the houses we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the stores we shop in.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, income, occupation, or age.
The bastions of the elite, from the fashionable London department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The parliament building is strewn with asbestos.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a pipefitter.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It seems there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years as an intern", he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors, and truckers - used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers have the same disease.
That was a question that, unfortunately, he could only partially answer.
"Of the four doctors who had been trained at Guy's Hospital and who had subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years", he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive".
How many of us get it?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
It's unusual to live that long.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can just repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us have the same disease?"
According to Professor Julian Pito, the UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, the most likely estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to end, some 90,000 people will die.
Most people don't realize they're going to die like this.

A quick look at courtroom records, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to exposing Janice Ellen to asbestos in an uncontrolled manner.
She worked at the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, running the clothing departments at two sites, one of which was a flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started at M&S.
She has two children now in their 20s.
"Before that", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, and I hardly knew about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word "asbestosform", which means a fibrous structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were commonly used in construction.
Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It's been used in roof panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seams, even in the brake pads of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but it is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a "serious source of health damage" that can lead to death.
However, brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crocodile oil) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong, though indirect, evidence to suggest that it is the main cause of the exceptionally high number of mesothelioma cases [in Britain]".
A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at the company's flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy.
Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients that suggests that "a significant percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or home, was likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment".
Much of this, he says, is due to "the usual use and weather" of our buildings.
No one seems to know for sure that he's safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which looked at Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, could be unconsciously affected.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical shafts and pipelines outside parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be set in motion by something as harmless as "strong air currents".
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite is true.
Although the Parliaments Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had received a "clean sanitary certificate", it has now acknowledged that £1 billion of work is needed to rebuild the parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MPs may be sitting in the nearby QE2 conference centre rather than the green benches of Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the asbestos situation was not managed according to various regulations".
There's no telling whether this mismanagement will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One of the people who never found out about his exposure to asbestos was Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital that successfully sued for asbestos", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places I've worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is a day in early December of 2009 when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly I started to get a fever.
It started really fast.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that pain came from the pleura, the membrane around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he couldn't go to work for a month.
The doctors were reluctant to take X-rays of the chest and insert pleural catheters to draw fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.
And yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms would return, often after he exercised and had difficulty breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to his office with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not connect it to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and dealt with asbestos directly.
The connection was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consulting physician showed his CT scans and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going", he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came back a week between Christmas and New Year's: "I was told it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma .
Abbott was suddenly caught up in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.
That's when he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos insulation was quite common on pipes", he says.
People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
So mesothelioma now affects younger people in unusual occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients were unlikely to be harmed.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement cafeterias (as Graham Abbott often did), were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
It turns out that for decades after the war, hospitals were a place where, in theory, they saved the lives of patients, but a place that was life-threatening for the doctors who treated them.
It's still being removed today.
Schoolchildren set up their Bunsen burners on asbestos supports
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, stores, libraries, and city halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant properties.
So are the schools.
In fact, many of them were likely exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren would set their Bunzen burners on asbestos supports.
Websites have been created to address the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless items like floor tiles or barn roofs tended to contain asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison that's been in a lot of our buildings", notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful when you remove the garden sheds.
The effect of diagnosis when you know it's incurable is huge.
"It takes a long time to realize that", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the hardest things was to go from being a doctor to being a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he had to take in.
"It was hard to understand", he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much time do I have?"
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to celebrate Christmas anymore.
That's it.'"
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it's the mechanics of how we sustain life -- the very act of breathing -- that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem is inhaling the needle-like fibers of asbestos", says Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos, now ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some of the others who may have been exposed during their internship at the hospital.
When asbestos needles enter the lung tissue, says Treger, "they are pushed by breathing out to the periphery, where the membrane is.
It's basically an invasive process from the start.
Conventional treatments for other forms of cancer are far less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treger doesn't agree with that.
"You can't cut the pleura", he says.
It's impossible to walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer "does not do well with chemotherapy", which "works", but does not cure.
"Once in a while, there are patients who live a long time", says Treger.
But eventually, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.
Two and a half years after his diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After he was diagnosed with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became a one-man support and counseling agency for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central", he said cheerfully when they called.
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He was diagnosed four years ago, and he's still very energetic.
Abbott was first offered six rounds of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life by just one month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "has managed to give everything a slightly more positive spin".
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lange-Lazdounsky, a professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"The advantage was that I didn't need directions, I just called them, and they took me in", admits Graham.
The average patient would have to get a referral and approval for funding.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment eventually proves to be ineffective, many sufferers face yet another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson has contacted Andrew Morgan at Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could pose a health risk.
That's when they started talking about corporate bad faith.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-cost settlement", according to Morgan, as Lawson could not unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of asbestos exposure at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for Guy's hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, tying fatal exposure to asbestos to one company or workplace - often decades later - has proved a major problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed ownership or closed.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend against lawsuits know that they have time on their side that the plaintiffs don't, of course.
In response, this year, major new legislation was passed that makes it easier for mesothelioma patients to claim compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a £350 million fund fund funded by the insurance industry was set up for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but have no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that a court would award in a normal compensation case - about £120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that £350 million is "very good work" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal written by insurers for insurers", he says, implying that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time frame hadn't been in place and mesothelioma patients could have tracked down the company and filed the lawsuit the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, admitted that the law was "imperfect".
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that with seven people dying every day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much and they need help today", Penning said during the second reading of the mesothelioma bill last December.
By then, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lange-Lazdounsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considered effective.
Radiation and chemotherapy followed, a tri-therapy in which Lange-Lazdonski boasts a 40 percent five-year survival rate.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
"This is certainly one of the most important things", says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some force that's holding you back.
When you give up, it can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott had surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of illness.
Then I had a scan in March.
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I was about to turn 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there's no sign of the tumors.
However, the process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things, like finances when I die, or showing my wife how to use the timer on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you get gloomy.
You have to look ahead.
As 16-year-old father Ellie and 14-year-old Tamsin, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn't live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Conversations like this are something that all cancer patients have to deal with.
But for mesothelioma patients, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even a glimmer of hope.
This disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
According to Andrew Morgan, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
The embalmed bodies of the pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloths.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now, a non-flammable canvas has been invented.
I've seen napkins made of it rot in the fireplace at banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, and soon after in America, Italy, and Russia.
It's the perfect insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Worldwide asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons a year.
Prudential's statistics reveal premature deaths among those who work with asbestos and who are denied life insurance as a result.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that asbestos particles in her lungs "were, without any doubt, the primary cause of death".
This is the first case of its kind.
Kershaw's owners, Turner Bros. Asbestos, have not accepted responsibility.
No compensation is paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding was intensively developed, one of the most deadly professions in terms of asbestos exposure.
The voluntary industrial ban on import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal upholds the first successful claim of health damage caused by exposure to asbestos in the UK.
World production of asbestos is growing to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139000 tonnes.
The Health and Safety Executive in the UK requires all contractors working with asbestos to obtain a licence.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The mesothelioma act is passed in the UK.
A £350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production is held at about 2 million tons a year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China's parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to run for office in the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to kick off the long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of this announcement.
The decision of the All-China People's Congress essentially allows the Communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"It didn't disappoint our expectations, but it still infuriates", said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it's obvious that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Congress, said that allowing a popular nomination for the Hong Kong leader would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain handed Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the head of government, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders have touted Sunday's decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominating commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And according to the new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer of one of the largest and most publicized protests in Hong Kong in years.
Much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is led by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong's financial district unless Beijing guarantees genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside Hong Kong's government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise to the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose details, apparently in an effort to avoid trouble with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement "has considered the possibility of capturing the central district only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to inform you that all the dialogue possibilities have been exhausted and the capture of the central district is certain to take place.
Hong Kong's government authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday security at the government headquarters was tightened with police and barricades.
The root cause of the unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland is intensifying competition in goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put at risk business, the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protest they're talking about could cause a lot of economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long", said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.
We don't want to spread the fear that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.
It's a perception that's bad for investment.
Chinese state media have also reported in recent days that Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists have been portrayed as Western-led saboteurs.
This summer, activists organized an informal referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong's voters.
And in July, tens of thousands marched in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
American prom culture reaches university life: freshmen offered to arrive in private jet
We are delighted to be responding to this demand by launching the UK's first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has considered safety.
This service is the perfect alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping this year's students get to university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesperson said that since the service was just launched, no orders had been received, but added that "students will start ordering the service in the next few weeks".
The company also said that although students were faced with the need to pay £9000 a year for tuition, it still hoped to find a market for the service.
Students today are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and expectations: it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as being out of touch with reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: "This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month are facing a cost of living crisis, where the available financial support in the form of loans and grants is falling short of the rapidly rising costs of basic necessities, before they can even begin to think about taking out thousands of pounds for something like a simple arrival in a dormitory.
Feminists raise racial issues and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
The crowd raises their hands and shouts, "Hands up, don't shoot", as they wait in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, over the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race when it came to advancing reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and national attention was drawn, Perez saw responses from white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9th killings, personal essays with headlines like "Thoughts on Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About the Oppression of Women" appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they've shown a significant shift.
"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privilege at such a high level", she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolic of the crisis we're facing, and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so tied to race, they felt it needed to be pointed out.
For Corita Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson exposed the problems that black American women face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural realm.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's happening to me and my partner, and I'll get 150 likes from everywhere", Mitchell says.
When I write about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"Why is it safe for women to talk about relationships in public but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly divide these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now integrating issues of race and gender into the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the basis for this was almost always the rape of a white woman", Hathery said.
It took a white woman to back up the story to justify the lynching.
In Hatter's view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for suffrage would be effective only for one group: women or blacks.
"They decided to put all the eggs in the basket for women's suffrage, and black suffrage was supposed to come later", Hattery said.
Looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women's Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came into being nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
In Mitchell's view, the rise of white feminists' reactions to the issues raised by the Ferguson situation - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to catch up with the issues that black women had been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if activists with this [traditional feminist] ideology took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?" Mitchell asked.
Second-wave feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what that means.
Two weeks after Michael Brown's murder, the prominent white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took to Facebook to publish a harsh article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in protests over racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the dangers of the body - and views on racial issues that differ substantially in public opinion polls - will lead the change", Steinem wrote.
While Steinem advocates a more intersecting feminism that includes issues of both race and gender, her comments on race in America still surprise some.
American Enterprise Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of "Who Stole Feminism?", told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Steinmeier's remarks about Ferguson contradict criticism she had previously voiced.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, Watch My Brother, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youth, it was followed by an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community are not the only issue that has pushed the traditional feminist front.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border this year, immigration reform has resurfaced again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that to make this issue important to women, she needed only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves", said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [male immigrants], the women who come with them are in a position of vulnerability to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are getting a response from women's organizations", she said.
The Ipswich pig house is for sale
A photograph of a house for sale in Suffolk was deleted by real estate agents when it turned out to show a large pig resting in the living room.
For sale for £120,000, a detached one-bedroom house on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on a sofa.
Connells real estate says the pig in the photo is the homeowner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has been deleted", a company spokesperson said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom detached house".
Although the agency removed the photo from its website, it still remains in the promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, with some asking if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who lost to Caroline Wozniak in the fourth round of the US Open, believes she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year and try to reach a new level, Vasily OSIPOV reports from New York.
How would you rate your overall performance at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad we won the Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I didn't have enough stability, especially at the end of some matches.
I'm upset right now, of course.
I didn't even make it to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After a bad loss, I have a huge motivation to take it to the next level.
I have a lot of work to do, and I'm going to do everything I can to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian Series starts in a couple of weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on physical culture, sport and youth affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses for the implementation of the norms of the State Organic Law when entering the higher education.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times, people will pass the standards on stretching, running and other exercises.
Recall that 12 Russian subjects will start implementing the GTO norms on their territory from September 1.
I also offered bonuses to students who passed the GTO, - said Valuev.
For example, you could give them a little extra credit on the SAT.
There are also suggestions to give extra days off to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the town of Harvey in South Wales , a new millionaire emerges after winning the lottery .
Harvey's lottery player this month.
There's a new millionaire hunt in southwest Perth, where one lucky guy takes home almost $1.1 million from a Saturday night lottery draw.
The Harvey newsstand is bringing gold in the grand prize draw for the second time in five years, with the last winner being $1 million in November 2009.
But the lucky winner still has to declare himself.
Store owner Steve Forward said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone's very excited.
We thought that such a win might be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the grand prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for the state's players.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the top five millionaires in August, following the huge $7.5 million win of a Belmont couple just weeks earlier.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and said that the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire brings the number of Western Australian grand prize winners to 59 this year, with a total prize pool of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Ministry's Department Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Auto Show 2014.
The plan was drafted on the government's instructions, and one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September - early October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-powered vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is in the Vedomosti) is for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for the evaluation of electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
A report to the government describing tax and customs measures to support electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a preferential lending and leasing scheme will be available by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is envisaged to make changes to the regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of giving it advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - proposals to expand state procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators of assessment of the activities of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, development of charging infrastructure.
The market for electric vehicles in Russia is still in its infancy - in 2013 about 100 electric vehicles were sold in the country.
In early 2014, the import duty on electric vehicles is zero, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts Mitsubishi Motors chief executive officer in Russia, Andrei Pankov.
But even a five-fold increase does not make electric cars noticeable: in 2013, Russia sold 2.78 million passenger and light commercial vehicles, according to the European Business Association.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company is focused primarily on corporate customers, says Nikola Remiz, Renault's director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia.
Most other electric vehicle manufacturers have taken a waiting position on Russia.
Russian manufacturers have developed electric vehicles - "", GAZ, "", but the output is meager.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to the ASM-holding, "Autovaz" has produced 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low because of the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of "Avtovaz" for engineering, Sergey Amanov, without state support breakthrough in this segment will not be....
The development of the Russian electric vehicle market, in addition to the high cost of cars (the electric vehicles sold in Russia are twice as expensive as their counterparts with internal combustion engines), is being held back by the underdeveloped charging infrastructure (fuel - units), sighs the general director of "Autostata" Sergey Целиков.
Due to the high cost and low rate of decrease in the cost of electric vehicles in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the chief editor of "Autorev" Mikhail Podrožanskiy, with whom Celikov agrees.
Carmakers, on the other hand, say that some electric models are already close to the cost of conventional cars.
The Russian electric vehicle market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electric mobility" is real; this will be facilitated, in particular, by the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia, Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rossetti": several stations have been built in Moscow, and soon about 80 more will appear.
Negotiations are underway with other regions to build a network of gas stations.
According to the director of the department "Rossets" Vladimir Sofiin, the company believes in the market of electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, Rossetti as a network company is not allowed to sell electricity, the possibility of doing so in relation to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov considers the zeroing of customs duties the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia.
The zero rate will be in effect until the end of 2014, and the possibility of extending it, expanding the list of benefits, is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental one (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as significantly as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Russia's transportation tax is low, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax cut led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars, which now account for 12 percent of the market.
Russia needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov believes, or the possibility of moving electric cars on designated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado .
A single-engine Piper PA-46 plane crashed in the U.S. state of Colorado.
Three of the five people on board were killed, reports ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident happened a few miles from the Denver airport runway.
The cause of the tragedy is being determined.
In Donetsk region, they're dealing with the captive fighters of the Donbass battalion.
The Karate were surrounded near Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of law enforcement officers were killed in the shelling.
Survivors say that if they had known what the situation was like in southeastern Ukraine, they would not have gone to war.
108 prisoners are lucky.
The punishers from the Donbass battalion survived the meat-cutting operation they were caught in near Ilovaisk.
The militants spent several days surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People's Republic, in fact abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters told them that the ring could be accessed through a supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But within minutes, shells and bullets were being fired from all sides.
"According to the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave", says the deputy battalion commander, who has the nickname "Lermontov".
And when we went down into the lowlands between Multipol and Chervonoselsky, cross fire started from anti-tank guided missiles, from "buzhkas", 30-millimeter grenade launchers, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three behind me, and there were only two cars left.
An officer with the Lermontov draft tells us that almost immediately at least 60 people were killed, dozens were injured, many died later.
The surviving militants are now being treated by the very people they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" are treating them well, giving them food, medicines.
While their own commanders have actually deceived them and doomed them to certain death.
We were simply betrayed, they say.
A column, a battalion, to destroy it.
Like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered for the Donbass battalion because the Ukrainian news reported atrocities allegedly committed by the "separatists" in the southeast.
Here Alexei saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Lugansk, and not by anyone but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me and told me that there was a mortar attack, which was probably carried out by the Ukrainian armed forces, says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion after that.
They wouldn't let us out of Iloivisk, they said we were in the ring.
I've already made arrangements with the commander, the report has already written about the withdrawal.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk from the Zurakhov army.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the "boiler" near Ilovaisk.
Some survivors now admit that if they could turn back time, they would never have joined the punishment battalion.
All the captured militiamen were handed over to the DNR forces.
Everyone will be tested for war crimes.
A food price control center has been set up in the region
A headquarters has been set up in the Krasnoyarsk Territory to limit the increase in the prices of products in the region's market if necessary.
The decree to establish this structure has already been signed.
The staff included members of the government of the region, representatives of the executive power and supervisory agencies.
Together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
News Economy ― Will Kiev compensate Rosneft for the $140 million in losses?
Rosneft head Igor Sechin said the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichan oil refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government to pay compensation", Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichan NPP was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There was no fighting, there were no 'dug up rebels', but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial site.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared", he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichan NPP, the oil storage tank burned down and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
The Lisichan NPP is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first line of the plant was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of oil per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the "Euro-4" standard, as well as a batch of diesel fuel of the "Euro-5" standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisichan NPP was suspended due to its loss-making.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft acquired the Lisichan NPP along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, the incident occurred at around 10:30 a.m. local time from the Chagangdo province, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
According to Interfax, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of South Korea, the missile is believed to have fallen into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble is falling amid geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Exchange, the dollar rose by 3 kopecks to 37.15 rubles, the ruble fell to the bi-currency basket amid geopolitical tensions.
The ETS trading on the dollar started with transactions in the range of 37.11-37.2 rubles/$1, in average for two minutes the rate was fixed at the level of 37.16 rubles/$1, this is 4 kopecks higher than the previous closing level.
The euro rate was 48.79 rubles for 1 euro, which is 3 kopecks higher than the previous closing level.
The price of the bi-currency basket added 3.5 cents and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The US dollar is trading 23 cents above the official rate, the euro 16 cents above the official rate.
The Russian market continued its rapid decline on Friday, August 29, but there was no panic this time.
The ruble kept getting cheaper and even updated the historic high against the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
But so far, it's more like artificial hysteria inflated by the media, especially the Western media.
There are not many options for imposing new sanctions on Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow stock exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the positions of the national currency may adjust.
Orenburg Airlines will be sued by Ideal-tour
"Orenburg Airlines" has filed a lawsuit against "Ideal-tour" for a total amount of 4,7 billion rubles.
We're talking about two cases that are scheduled for October.
There will be different judges.
According to Interfax, the first lawsuit was filed on August 14.
It's a little over 425 million rubles.
The hearing is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was filed on August 18.
It's worth 4.24 billion rubles.
The hearing is scheduled for October 2.
As the Russian Union of Tourists told reporters, judges have been appointed for different cases.
In July, the media reported that Ideal-tour owed Orenburg Airlines 1.5 billion rubles.
The airline's general manager, Viktor Zyukin, said the amount was 1.6 billion rubles.
Aeroflot's general director, Vitaly Savelyev, calls it even more than that - two billion rubles.
Twitter tried to be more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the registration process to engage new members more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This should reduce the number of people who abandon their microblogs.
New Twitter users will now be able to browse a large number of recommended accounts while signing up to create their own reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests indicated at the time of registration.
Twitter automatically sets a subscription tag for all the automatically selected accounts.
This will require the user to manually uncheck to avoid reading the ones that are not of interest.
Whereas previously users of the microblogging service only saw avatars of recommended users, now Twitter is pulling a sample of one of the popular tweets of a blogger to help build an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change to the Twitter signup page in the last three years.
Twitter has been working hard to modernize its service.
This activity is primarily due to the continuing efforts of the service to achieve profitability.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced slowing user growth and declining readership.
The company is desperate for more loyal customers who, once they're in, stay for a long time.
That's the only way to ensure a steady flow of advertising money.
Moscow 's Day of Knowledge will be rainy and rainy
On September 1st, the Moscow region will be cold and rainy all day, meteorologists say.
The air temperature in Moscow will be 16 to 18 degrees, in Moscow - 13-18 degrees.
In cloudy weather with clearings, rain will fall, the wind in the eastern quarter will be rather weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
The program of recycling cars resumed from September 1
From September 1 in Russia, the program for the recycling of cars is resumed.
Until 31 December 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other directions of support.
The program will cover all cars over six years old.
The compensation amount will be from 40 thousand rubles for a light car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Earlier, Russia had a similar program for the disposal of cars.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is not only intended to use the cars to get a discount, but also the possibility in case the car is over six years old, to buy a new one with a discount when the old one is handed over to the dealer, Interfax reports.
The previous federal program of recycling, which ran from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2011, cost more than 16 billion rubles.
Thanks to it, the level of production of light vehicles in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (that is 101.4% more than in 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator is releasing a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He talked about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but it's only recently that this fact has become widely known.
The game was inspired by the events in Ferguson, where protests are currently underway after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has no name yet, will be on how the news coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a citizen journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in the areas where there are clashes between police and the population.
The hero can take pictures of the scene in different ways, which will affect the course of events.
If he filmed it in a way that makes the police look like heroes and the protesters look like thugs, the police would start treating him better and let him go where the average person can't go.
If he covers events differently, his photos could turn peaceful protests into a full-scale riot.
The game will need to score points using the hero's Twitter account, which will generate new followers if the photos posted there become popular.
The game doesn't have a name yet.
The release date and platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, posted an image showing how an event can change depending on how the photograph was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for quite some time, but originally wanted to dedicate it not to the protests in the US, but to the events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media coverage of the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on the events.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which follows events from Case's own life, is about how a bisexual teenager tries to tell his relationship to homophobic parents.
Gelethe is dragging Ukraine into the bloodshed
With the call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery Geletey is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
"In Moscow, of course, attention was paid to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Gelete, who declared the "conclusion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great Patriotic War", in which losses will be calculated in "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page the mentioned post, is a subject for research by specialists not in the military field", - the message of Russian diplomats says.
They find it hard to believe that such statements could come from a minister of defense in a civilized country.
On his Facebook page, the Ukrainian defense minister wrote on Monday: "The Russian side has threatened several times on unofficial channels that if resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us".
He also stated that the "operation to liberate the east of Ukraine" was completed.
Perez Hilton deleted all the intimate photos of the stars and apologized
Today, horror has gripped more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers have hacked the primitive iCloud passwords of smartphones, and their intimate photos have appeared on the website of blogger Perez Hilton.
It's not for long.
Jennifer Lawrence, the official spokesperson for the star of "The Hunger Games", has reported that photos were stolen from her mobile phone, and has confirmed that all the photos that are "shining" on the Internet are authentic.
Perez Hilton, the creator of the tabloid site of the same name, apologized to actress Jennifer Lawrence and her colleagues at the shop for publishing their candid photos, The Independent reports.
No, no one made me do it.
I haven't been contacted by their agents.
And now I'm deleting the candid photos of Jennifer Lawrence and Victoria Justice", the blogger wrote on Twitter.
But all the candid photos of the stars have already been leaked online.
David Beckham got in a car accident while hiding from the paparazzi.
David Beckham was in a motorcycle accident trying to escape a paparazzi.
It happened in Los Angeles at a corner on Sunset Boulevard.
The British footballer got away with a blow and stretching of the muscles of his right arm.
Beckham came out of the tattoo parlor where the paparazzi were waiting for him.
While evading their pursuit on a motorcycle, he failed to control the turn and fell, TMZ reports, citing sources close to the footballer.
As a result, Beckham suffered a concussion, a sprain of the muscles of his right arm, and a scratch.
Tony Stewart is in a car accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track was over just over halfway through the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall a second time after his right front tire broke off on lap 172, ending his run.
Stuart drove his wrecked car to the garage and then walked out without talking to reporters.
His team manager, Chad Johnston, said the 14 members of the team were upset, but would now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him", Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, and hopefully we'll do better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
"I started today with a pretty big hope of coming to the finish", Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded onto the evacuator, and the team was assembled and ready to go.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver during a dirt track race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to take part in the Chase.
He returned to work during an investigation into the tragic incident that killed 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who went out on the track to voice his displeasure with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the crash will continue for at least two more weeks.
A decision on whether to charge Stuart has not been made.
The three-time champion was greeted with loud shouts and applause when he was introduced before the race.
Starting from 12th position, Stewart was in the top 10 at the start of the race, finishing in fourth position.
Then on lap 122 after the restart, Bush's number.
Car 18 went off course at the exit of Turn 2 and crashed into Stewart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell to 21st.
Sobchak and Vitorgan are smoking cigarettes with Zvanetski in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are currently in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not miss to report on her Instagram.
One photo, however, surprised and confused the couple's fans.
The picture was taken at Zvanetski.
"At the breakfast at Mikhail Mikhalych Zvanetskiy Maxim explains what is Instagram:)) #odessa", - signed the photo by Ksenia Sobchak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.
No coffee, no buns, no butter or anything...
The couple's fans decided that Xueisha smoked, too, and condemned her for it.
"Whose cigarettes?", "Smoking kills!", "Some kind of cigarette breakfast) ", "It seems like at breakfast, but only cigarettes on the table))) ", "Xenia, do you also smoke?", - her blog subscribers were excited about her favorite.
Recall that Sobchak recently boasted about what a delicious dinner Maxim Vitorgan had prepared for her for the first time in her life.
"Happiness is when you come to the dacha,and your husband has prepared dinner for you (for the first time in married life,it's delicious).The main thing is that now at the end of the dinner he does not say the words from the joke:"if only it were like this every day now", boasted her husband Ksenia Sobchak.
The picture shows Maxim preparing something with great effort, and the table is already filled with salt and roasted chicken.
Prisoners in Bulgaria hold national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital city of Sofia.
During the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands to return to the previous working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The increase in salaries is also part of the list of demands that will be discussed with acting minister of justice Hristo Ivanov.
For a month, officers protested symbolically against the new work schedule, demanding that 24-hour shifts be reinstated.
Despite the fact that the prison workers' union has met repeatedly with the Ministry of Justice, no agreement has been reached, reports Bulgarian National Radio (BNR).
Negotiations are continuing, said the head of the Main Department for the Execution of Penalties, Rosen Zhelazkov.
The protest is expected to be joined by members of the Federation of Prison Employees' Unions.
The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Pruitt (right) appoints Regent Wongsuwan (left) as his new defense minister
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-ocha, has announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, in which more than a third of the positions are held by generals or retired generals.
Army representatives were given key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-ocha was officially confirmed as prime minister after the Thai king formally approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to the post.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected Prime Minister at a parliamentary meeting.
The army had previously appointed parliamentarians.
According to Prayut Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by a six-month-long demonstration, during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.
Officially, Prayut Chan-ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold a general election in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22
The civil authorities are completely paralyzed.
Leaders of the main political parties were placed under temporary arrest.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country's leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Shinawatra.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis has its roots in 2006, when the army removed Yinglik's brother Chinwat Taksin from the post of prime minister.
Both are popular with rural people, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the capital's elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
"No one said clam salad would be better, I didn't promise you that", jokes the waitress at the new Palm's.
You have to formally admit that it is, but the mind and the stomach remain unyielding.
Because everybody knows that we say "Belgium" - we mean "Midias", we say "Midias" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurants like to say in a very profound way that the success of a restaurant depends on three things: location, location, and again location.
There are places that are not so well located, or even perfect, but they're unlucky.
So, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that there used to be a cafe called "Horodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and then "Bojole" restaurant and "Druzhba" beer.
Now it's beer again, but not nostalgic Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg is above ground: a bar and a couple of tables, all the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But it's like a nursery, with red, yellow, and green walls, colorful chairs, and instead of windows, TVs with mermaids swimming.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are not new, so there is a lot to compare.
There are eight types of beer available (260-300 rubles for 0.5 l) and an uncountable number of bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress is cheerfully presenting the menu, telling that "media is a rich big seed", and it should be noted that it is the service, despite some flaws, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Who could have foreseen that a meat-and-egg roll with Walloon blackcurrant (Rs 280) was actually a carpaccio, cut so thinly that parchment paper would appear to be an ugly piece of material compared to it?
You can't taste anything unless you've got half a plate.
Salads are worse.
The classic Liege (260) would be best considered a crime against the Belgian people: some kind of puffy iceberg, a potato that was boiled long ago, a scattered Kenyan bean, a wooden bacon chip and some pickled onion.
You don't want to meet anyone with a Lejeune salad like that!
The ingredients of the Belgian salad were somewhat different, but the impression was not so positive either.
If you could turn a blind eye to unripe tomatoes or to fried champagne, why do clams look as if they had been thawed and boiled several times in their lifetime?
I already know there are some perfectly normal clams here!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, the one with the white wine, celery and carrots, I honestly didn't like it.
There's vegetables, but no aroma, and whether there was wine is a mystery.
But the good ones are the squid-based fries with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken wateroom here is not a loaf so thick that you can decide, depending on your mood, whether it's your first or second course, but just a nice butter soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked by a local chef in a beer sauce, and there was no mention of rosemary.
The situation turned out to be the opposite: Rosemary was choking everything.
It was thought that the rabbit was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes, which gave the meat such an unusual aroma.
But the rabbit's leg was accompanied by a wonderful - no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
Palm offers waffles not only sweet, but also rich - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce was too watery, and the waffles were dry.
But the manager came to the table and asked, very informally, about the experience of the lunch.
Well, then, you should come back.
The dollar rose by more than 37 rubles on the IMF's news of the West's new sanctions against Russia.
That's a new record.
The dollar rose by 26.9 cents at 10:29 am, and was 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 cents - to 48.73 rubles, according to data from the Moscow stock exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closing and was worth 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached its maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, both in relation to the euro and to the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, says senior analyst Anna Bodrova of Alpari.
Everything about Ukraine will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors of a military invasion are unconfirmed by either side, but the market has turned very emotional.
All talk of him being resistant to news like this was deleted yesterday.
The week, according to the forecast of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are low, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all of these are links in the same chain.
Inflation is also forecast to rise: current prices will rise by 5 to 10 percent in the fall.
Soon, too, the seasonal fruits and vegetables will run out, and there will be a vacuum as the chains shift to other suppliers.
"The dollar has reached the 37-ruble mark, passed it and returned, there is no strong hysteria", says Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department at Opening Broker.
They're still waiting to see if the sanctions they promised will be imposed on Saturday, when NATO meets.
The ruble, he said, had weakened sharply after the end of the tax season, then news broke about Ukraine, and the Central Bank said last week that it was fully moving to a floating exchange rate by the end of the year and was refusing any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was scared of the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
So, nothing really powerful happened in terms of the turnover.
The most worrying times for the currency market were, I'll remind you, when the high demand for currency was observed at the end of January, and also on March 3rd, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, it is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as the increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in the price of imports, says the chief analyst of UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
The negative aspects include the rise in the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investments in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause the cost of borrowing money to rise, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the devaluation of the ruble somewhat smooths the decline in the prices of shares expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index fell 1.67 percent during Thursday's trading, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the index decline is explained by the weakening of the ruble over the course of the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions gradually disappear, and ruble quotations partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We think that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar to the Russian currency close to the level of 36 rubles per dollar", says Alexey Kozlov.
Genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed
The British woman said she spent many years thinking she was going to die after being misdiagnosed.
Caryn Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a group of inherited disorders that cause nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
CMT UK charity reports that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with MS because so little is known about the condition.
Some 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have PTSD, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, unsteady gait and cramped toes.
Patients may experience numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, meaning that symptoms get worse over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrichs Ataxia, a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she'd be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18, and dead by the time she was 30.
The 51-year-old mother of two said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do what others could.
I was falling every day, and it took me more time to do it.
I could never skate or skate with other children, and I was often teased at school for the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to loosen her Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at her medical records when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
"I felt guilty because I was in the wrong place, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, found information about the condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association", she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic that could be imagined.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she had thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me, and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease, because you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something that's much less of a threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have TBI.
"When he explained what the MTS was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket", she said.
The UK MST charity has launched an MST awareness month to try to raise awareness of the disease.
Tax burden on Washington-area entrepreneurs grows as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales, and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country have increased moderately over the past year as the recovery has accelerated, according to a new study released last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses last year increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years of declining bills in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes are up faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study by a professional services firm, Ernst & Young, and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenue, 56 percent, is from business taxes, while Maryland's tax revenue is 36 percent from corporations.
Virginia, at 28 percent, brings in the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is driven by a return to the previous level of value of corporate real estate, the researchers say, which has raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row when growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large share of this revenue is coming from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia paid a combined $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up $9.6 billion from 2012, a 4.2 percent increase from the year before.
However, the observed return on property value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or a nonprofit that doesn't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
So Maryland has to rely much more on, say, income taxes to pay for the same services that other states have.
The recent rise in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurial incomes also seem to be improving, according to this data.
Companies in the region filed $2.3 billion in statewide corporate income taxes, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are in one direction, the tax burden on local entrepreneurs is not increasing at the same rate in all three areas.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was the same as the national average, 4.3 percent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia saw a lower-than-average increase in tax revenues of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax rate of the three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), at 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs at the state and local levels and, in general, a more favorable tax climate for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county wasn't evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to as high as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to a recent study.
The taxes on entrepreneurs paid as individual income taxes by small business owners - the transitional structure under which most small firms are structured - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than the taxes on women entrepreneurs overall.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with state and local government turnover tax revenue up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may be lagging behind as the decline in federal spending is affecting the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The world championship of judo at home brought the Russian team two silver and seven bronze medals.
In this indicator, the Russians were only behind the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese national team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the 60 kg category, won the title.
In the equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one remark received by the Russian.
The second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday they won three medals at once.
In the men's competition in the category up to 66 kg, silver went to Mikhail Pulyayev, and bronze - to Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the 2011 and 2013 world champion, Japanese Masashi Ebinume.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarter-final stage, won the consolation tournament and became the bronze medalist.
In the women's tournament up to 52 kg, Natalia Kuzyutina also reached the third step of the honorary podium.
In the semifinals, she lost to the reigning world champion Maylinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended her title.
In the bronze medal match, Kuzyutina won from Ma Inan of China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place was not what she had expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way to the gold was Kelmendi, who had previously defeated Kuzyutina in the final of the European championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, bronze was placed in the Russian team's pool by Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, he was upset by former Moldova representative Victor Skvortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov played in the domestic championship with a leg injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a break from competitions.
As for former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he won the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, his other compatriot, who has taken the UAE's sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko, finished with a bronze in the 100 kg category.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Championships also brought one bronze to the Russians, which Ivan Nifontov won in the category up to 81 kg.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated Frenchman Alan Schmidt at the expense of a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of medals were played at the tournament, but the Russians were traditionally limited to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
It was won by Kirill Voprosov, and the Russian team was guaranteed this medal: his rival in the consolation final was his compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival of V. V. Prossov could not go out on tatami due to injury.
The bronze was won by the owners on the sixth day of the competition - it was put into the team's treasury by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clean sweep of Brazil's David Moura.
So the individual part of the world championship ended.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of the world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the fair sex were unlucky - they did not reach the medal.
The Russian judoka won the team silver.
In the decisive match, they lost in a hard-fought 2-3 to the main favourites of the competition - the Japanese team.
Russia led 2-0 after a clean victory over Khan-Magomedov and a free-throw victory over Denis Yarcev (weighing 73 kg).
However , in the heavier weight categories , Murat Hbachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100) could not cope with their Japanese rivals .
The same scenario developed in the bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team led 2-0, losing to the Japanese 2-3.
The team competition in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament ended congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is a great honor, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions", Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo, there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win them.
The Russian national team performed much better at the world championship at home than at the similar level held in Rio de Janeiro a year ago.
Then the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansour Isaev.
We're all, of course, big maximalists.
Yeah, I want gold medals.
But let's remember, if a person in the Olympic cycle is in the top eight, then he's a potential Olympic winner.
Especially in a sport like judo", - summed up the tournament the Minister of sport of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan's team was expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of various merit, five of which were gold.
The next world championship will be held next summer in Astana.
Other materials, news and statistics can be found on the summer sports page.
The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best .
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're hoping for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after receiving an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at Yorkville Endoscopy's Upper East Side clinic, sources say.
Doctors intentionally keep her under anesthesia and under close supervision until they are satisfied that her condition remains "severe".
The response was broad, including massive online support from the likes of Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripp.
All the kings can do
Royal Blood's debut album is a new hope for British rock, taking the rock duo from clubs to stadiums.
Royal Blood have been on the scene for just over a year, but they've already been nominated for a BBC Music Award, a warm-up tour with Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert set from Jimmy Page himself.
Their eponymous debut album had received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current sad state of the music industry, it's a very unusual situation, because this is not the new Lana Del Rey or the new R'n'B with the sweet voice, but a duo of British bull-looking guys playing with the same level of volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were particularly high and already quite justified.
The duo has made a name for themselves that could only be attacked by desperate metal hairy men, and the blood of kings seems to be in their veins, too.
It's, of course, above all, the heroes of Led Zeppelin's past: like the great quartet, Royal Blood are aiming to shake up the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to new heights.
It's too early to predict the success of this venture, but there are some things we can say.
Ten songs in thirty-two minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal compositional talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual songs, of course, cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by being remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum part.
Musicians joke that this song is easier to play than to sing.
Also noteworthy is the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
The truth is, though, that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played back-to-back, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they don't claim the praise of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather aiming at Motörhead's successors), but have brought out numerous rock duos from the ghettos of indie clubs.
Their music, though somewhat varied, is made for stadiums, in a room of less than a couple thousand people, obviously cramped.
The secret lies in part in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the familiar format invented by the early zero The White Stripes.
But it's not just the instruments, it's the way you write the songs.
The retro-rock zero heroes had a hard time moving beyond the postmodern paradigm, reluctantly recognizing themselves as not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood sounds so powerful and bold that it successfully strips away some of the secondary and hard-boiled material.
After all, who says rock has to be smart?
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion.
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Friday morning: The online store - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying streaming video service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news was surprising not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for well over a billion dollars seemed to be complete, and the combination seemed natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set out to be a streaming service of a general nature - a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly evolved into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; "YouTube for real-time gaming", according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos where the know-it-all give (mostly old) games a "mystery theater" treatment, is already popular on YouTube.
The fact is, YouTube is mentioned a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the YouTube deal failed, given that he was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Emmet Shear, CEO of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster".
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they'd rather be doing sports than watching them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games instead of taking the joystick in your hands.
It's one thing to watch over a friend's shoulder at 3:00 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and it's quite another to watch some stranger get 20 consecutive shots to the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them without controlling the viewing angle yourself can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I'll agree that speed-crossing, where the Rogers Bannisters of the electronic age finish entire games in record time, is entertaining.
But unless it's about game virtuosity or humor, it's unlikely his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, making it the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How exactly is Amazon going to make money off of this?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch would fold into Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could simply absorb Twitch.
But Twitch has what any company would love to have: a crowd of young men that advertisers dream of.
As Twitch CEO Sheer said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the channel shows no signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked to the survivors of the hostage crisis - almost all of them are students, the parents of the victims, the cemetery warden of the City of Angels, Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the "Materiel Bez" committee, Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation with the emergency services, - says the correspondent of the "Society" department, Elizabeth Antonova, who worked on the special project.
After returning to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was the president's adviser on the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "B" department of the Russian FSB, Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What really struck me during my time working on this topic is that it was as if there hadn't been a decade in Beslan.
This is a very painful topic for anyone who has anything to do with it, people are having a hard time agreeing to talk about what happened.
The experience of the trip is very difficult.
But Beslan cannot be forgotten, and I hope we have done our job", Antonova said.
The special project is prepared by the Rambler & Co. holding's infographics studio, which has been working at the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's rise to power.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan, Renhap reports.
The launch was made around 10.30am local time from the Chagangdo province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile is believed to have fallen in the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers, the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of South Korea said.
Deputies suggested speeding up the entry into force of the Personal Data Law
If the initiative is successful, Russian data will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The draft law, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians, was introduced in the State Duma from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative base of the lower chamber.
It was written by the State Duma deputies Vadim Degengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parahin ("Justice Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
This change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more prompt and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and the observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, which parliamentarians are rushing to enact, obliges to store personal data of Russians processed through the Internet on the territory of the Russian Federation.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, store, clarify and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right to restrict access to information processed in violation of the Russian legislation in the field of personal data on the basis of a court decision.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of offending sites - an automated information system called the "Register of violators of the rights of subjects of personal data".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Denganin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who don't have data centers in Russia will have to pay rent
Commenting on the draft law introduced today in the State Duma, first deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said he saw no problem in postponing the date of the entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own personal data storage of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers in lease and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies that today already provide their servers".
"There are also several independent data centers willing to cooperate in this area", he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I don't see any problems - they will get technological opportunities for placement", Levin concluded.
The controversial bill
Immediately after the bill was published, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, it is about online booking of air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation".
The RAEC's statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user where the recording is being made, systematizing his personal data.
In this case, the person can choose the territory where the actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills to "localise" personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and significant economic losses.
The ice water test participant has her jaw twisted .
Isabel Roberts of Britain cried so loudly when she was poured ice water on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
That ice water test went badly wrong.
A woman was hospitalized after she screamed so loudly during an ice water test that she sprained her jaw.
Isabel Roberts screamed so violently when she was poured ice water on her head that it damaged her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, but as I did so, my jaw started to get stuck", she told The Mirror.
They pour water on a 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts seconds before the accident .
I tried to shut my mouth, but he wouldn't, he got stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister had the same realization and started to stutter, but I had to be rushed to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman in the UK was taken to hospital for a jaw repair after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation and was shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
The militia handed over 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The Novorossiya Army claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27 and accuses the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement.
The militias as of 10:00 on September 1st handed over to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead soldiers.
This was reported to "Interfax" by the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya".
He added that "the air defense forces in the area of the settlement of Mereski shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreement".
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side used cassette ammunition, which is prohibited by international conventions, during the artillery shelling of the Lugansk airport.
The press service representative noted that the militiamen managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"The enemy's casualties were up to 100 killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered", the headquarters official summed up.
Interfax has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed forces of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 captured military personnel and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side within the framework of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, the DPR army, according to the "Army of Novorossiya", "intercepted the attempt of the national guardsmen to remove heavy equipment from the surrounding area in violation of previously reached agreements".
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs in a short battle, the capture of six tanks and the disarming of 198 servicemen.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupolsk) for that night were five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
Late last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk area of the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do this on the condition that the enemy surrendered their weapons and ammunition.
The first dozen soldiers began leaving the besieged settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, who was surrounded, on Sunday night, 14 more people came out of the "pot".
Semenchenko wrote on his Facebook page that Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at the 137th regiment of the 32nd Russian Division and the 9th tank brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry reports.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the European Council's "conclusions" of August 30 showed the EU member states' inability to overcome the inertia of their unyielding support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unproven claims about the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of this country", the ministry's website says.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is being influenced by countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the warring parties", the ministry stressed.
The agency's website also notes that there are no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is growing.
We remind you that during the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against Russia .
EU officials work closely with US officials.
It is expected that they will correlate the measures introduced with each other in terms of duration and degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government also announced an extension of sanctions against Russia in the areas of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Tricky ways to save on university textbooks
With university textbooks costing many students more than $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is about to transfer to his second year, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of renting books from high school students, offering them a nominal compensation for delaying their sale.
"My math analysis textbook, which normally costs $180, I got for $10 a semester and a "Chick-fil-A" cookie", says Schroeder, 19, who is a student at Covenant College in Georgia.
The literature he needed last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Council of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to cut those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to the Schroeder system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, and often costs significantly less than buying one.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Trevor Meyer, vice president of Nibo.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here's an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Shopping at the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you'd find in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of Mathematical Analysis by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler is priced at about $290 per pre-order, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Buy used .
If you don't mind being marked or damaged, second-hand textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is on sale for $93.49 in its second hand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassaday, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a used copy of the textbook "Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business".
The book sold for $48 new.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Bracey, director of College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, suggest that students ask their professors if they can use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are not essential to the class.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative for buying used books.
Renting
If you're good enough to handle them, you'll remember to return them and you won't want to keep them after the course is over, you should think about renting them.
You can save over 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Math Analysis for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up books, including any fines you may be charged for marks, underlining, and damage.
If you rent a book, remember that if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
The electronic books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented out by purchasing a period-limited electronic license from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Renting Mathematical Analysis from Chegg.com for six months is about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the best prices, since many classic works are now available for free download, while science and engineering literature can be quite expensive.
No matter what, look around.
Joe Gault, 29, who is about to start law school at Pepperdine, recommends using an ISBN to find out the price of a book, as it ensures that you are looking for the text you need.
Before ordering online, Galt says, be sure to check that the book is actually in stock.
He learned that lesson with difficulty.
The book he bought was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid full price at the university bookstore.
Putin says the Far East Development Fund is completely ineffective
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budgetary investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
"15 billion rubles are still in deposits", the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of the TORs should be introduced in the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, had not yet approved the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East and their criteria until July 1.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, improving transport accessibility in the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for export development.
Among other things, it is necessary to create preconditions for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form areas of rapid development that should become competitive with key business centers of the Asia-Pacific, the president stressed.
We've heard that the area of rapid development could replace the EEC.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy couldn't save the box office
Sylvester Stallone's Unstoppable 3 returned less than $30 million of its $90 million budget in the U.S., while Sin City: A Woman Worth Killing For returned only $12 million of its $70 million budget.
Home Video with Cameron Diaz only brought in $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like How to Train Your Dragon 2 also disappointed in revenue.
Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin's article points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Colin called 2014 the "worst" year in the history of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a barely "functioning" fantasy sequel.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem is not necessarily the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of every film released in the summer of at least 2,000 copies between the May Memorial Day holiday and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of both filmgoers and critics, suggest that this year's film crop is similar in caliber to last year's hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney film The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing".
We have to accept that and not try to chase what was before.
In contrast to the current drop in Hollywood box office receipts, Netflix's revenue from streaming services reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year's figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book franchises, and predicted the "crash" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there was some truth to his gloomy predictions.
With several potential box office hits expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minyonov and Jurassic Park, other filmmakers are more optimistic.
"X-Men" producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in box office receipts simply "cyclical", telling the Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest box office summer in history, and nobody's going to worry about it".
Food sanctions do not scare the owners of caucasian and central Asian restaurants, but for European and Japanese restaurants, Russian suppliers are a nightmare.
And in general, the public still prefers to replace the banned imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
"Better a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella", says Mariano Valerio, the chef at Barlotti, an Italian restaurant, over the quality of the cheeses that his suppliers offer him instead of Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan's got enough for a couple of months.
What do you want me to do?
Going to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: the shocking memories keep him up to date.
The meat was lying on the cart just a foot from the floor!
There are cats!
The rats!
I said then that for our restaurant we would never buy anything from the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe things have changed there now.
But the other day, I got a fish from the Far East to try.
So she was a dead man!
I said I don't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the freak show.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It has to hang off to become soft, to relax the muscles.
I did all this with local beef.
Then I was asked, "Where did you get such tender meat?"
I said, "That's your Russian!"
Why doesn't anyone do that?
Five minutes' walk from Barlotti, the French restaurant Brasserie Most has a stop-list in the kitchen, listing the missing items: French oysters, sea urchins.
Chef of Brasserie Most and Bar Strelka, Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: French oysters have already been replaced by Tunisian oysters, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
Regis is more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Cabbage - 200 rubles!
I say, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
And they say, "Well, we have to make money, too".
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters, we buy them by weight, but they live 15 to 20 years, do you know how much their shell weighs?
The price is a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign chefs.
Standard story: "Three months was good, then the quality went down".
The main complaints: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don't know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

The sanctioned menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure Russia's security, which are called mainly food sanctions.
Importation of beef, pork, poultry meat and offal, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups is prohibited.
Restaurants have begun to compete with suppliers: the prices of food have risen, and it is urgent to look for analogues from other countries.
The most affected are the expensive restaurants with single-kitchens in France, Italy, Spain, which were supplied directly from the "mother" countries.
The whole thing's been rebuilt before.
For example, when the Federal Agricultural Inspection Service banned the import of Australian beef in early 2014, and the year before that, American and Canadian beef.
In return, suppliers have arranged for beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer of 2014 sanctions turned out to be much more serious.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that removed from the ban the Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Valerio, the Italian, hopes that sanctions can be eased further.
Meanwhile, some restaurants exist in uncertain conditions.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Dull restaurants will have to change their menus to those produced by local farmers and other countries", says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur who owns the agency Restconstalt.
If the chef is strong, he won't have a problem.
We just don't have a lot of chefs like that, and it could take two to three months to develop a new menu.
The trigger from Brasserie Most is ready for this: to refuse 10-15% of the dishes, the other half of the menu - to recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine, they are already starting to replace dishes, such as steak made from marbled beef, with steak, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced by Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile", says representative of the company "East-West" Oksana Glibchuk.
Cloves and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seaweed from Norway - salmon, seaweed, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of European-produced vegetables and fruits can be compensated by products from domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget chain restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who are able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian go there.
Although he believes it will be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions.
The Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants with different brands and menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace", Mironov says.
Ginza declined to comment, citing a lack of ownership in the country.
Cafes with Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that the products of the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than those of Europe
But there are plenty of restaurants that are practically unaffected.
These include establishments with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine", says Hatuuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Vay Me!".
All our cheeses are made in Russia, and we don't use chicken fillet or exotic vegetables".
Kolbai's hasn't removed a single dish from the menu yet.
Timur Lanski, owner of the "Chaihona N1" restaurant with Uzbek cuisine, is also not embarrassed by the sanctions: he will only have to change the lamb for New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe, he says.
It is cheaper to get cuts, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits from the CIS.
And what they bring from Central Asia is much better than the plastic from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes, they are delicious, sweet.
No one talks about Spanish like that.
After the sanctions were imposed, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, said that he planned to double the export of fruit and vegetables to Russia by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan declared their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions were imposed.
The fast food restaurants that responded to Money's request are also responding to the sanctions quite calmly.
McDonald's press service said that the localization is over 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the department for suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80% of the products the network buys in Russia, although temporary difficulties may arise with the supply of vegetables and the rise in prices of meat products, which are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, "sanctioned products" generally took no more than 4%.
Sanctions and Walker's sandwich are not affected.
KFC, Burger King and Potato Chicken did not respond to Money's request, but other market participants claim that Burger King's localization is significantly lower than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, the restaurant is more willing to buy Chilean than Russian Far Eastern.
On my hump
Meanwhile, restaurant owners complain that the rising demand is driving up prices even for local produce.
"The prices of the products for the "Grables" have increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant "Cherry Mio" - by two times", says restaurant manager Roman Rozhnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of food will rise by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian milk products have increased in price by 10-15% since the beginning of August".
"Brazil's pork suppliers have nearly doubled their pork prices", complains Sergei Rak, deputy general manager of Stardogs.
Chicken curry is up 35%.
We're waiting for prices from China, maybe they'll cool off the Brazilian hotheads.
There's a planned 8% price increase at the Star Dogs in the near future.
"It's not a good idea to raise prices", says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of the general food revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
That's the lowest since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it's unclear how fast: while most restaurants stock up on food for the next two months in hopes of avoiding falling purchasing prices.
But what happens in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow city hall, there are dozens of tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the middle of the stage, musicians are playing the waltz.
It's a regional food festival with the funny title "There's Time to Eat".
"We had been planning to have a local food festival for a long time, and then we had to hurry, because of the sanctions", says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, Greek chef Anastasis is preparing a salad of macaroni and homemade candy, and the other day there was a master class on making borsh with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of the achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from the Republic of Bashkiria, deer from Salehard, vegetables from the Moscow-based "Lenin-Name Farm", cheese from the Italian Jay Clouse.
"The salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another salmon from the Far East", says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop "Swype People".
We have the king salmon, the king salmon, the king salmon, the king salmon, the king salmon.
Yeah, they're not as fat as Norway salmon, because they're wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You hold him, he doesn't even move.
And you can't keep our far-eastern salmon.
Only the most uncompromising establishments are willing to replace Italian mozzarella with domestic.
In the window of his tent are shrimp with the "Magadan" badge, cod, owl, muck, mussels from the Crimea, oars from the Far East.
Galkin thinks it's time to switch to the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 is more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the USA.
Fish imports in 2013 were about 800 thousand tons.
The "Swy People" shop has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the sanctions were imposed, it served another one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things".
Galkin's got applications from 15 other restaurants.
"You could make the same sushi with our fish", he says.
We got stuck, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is several times cheaper, and the delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation, I'm getting a Philadelphia with ketchup at Galkin's tent.
Unlike the seaweed rolls, these take longer to chew, but the awareness that this fish is our, native, gives strength.
The Swype Shop even has a roll of the palto and the sea urchin.
In sushi bars, it's true that Norwegian salmon is preferred over Chilean salmon.
Galkin explains it by saying that cooks are lazy to come up with new recipes for Far Eastern fish.
"We have not yet been offered Russian fish by suppliers", explains Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev.
The situation is similar with other products: Russian producers could take the niche, but this is not happening.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large multinational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They can quickly replace illegal imports unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit the big producers of other countries", Akimov says.
However, the restaurant industry has received a more alarming signal in the last month than the food sanctions.
Following the results of the massive, unplanned inspections by Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Ekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
"We are studying the merits of the claims to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible", McDonald's's press service told Money.
Nobody really understands what's going to happen next.
If it's all about food sanctions, that's one option that can be overcome", said an employee of a restaurant consulting company on condition of anonymity.
If they start shutting down McDonald's all over the country, it's a very different scenario.
"Euro-protocol" instead of the GIDD reference
Casco payments will be available without a GIDD certificate - the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "euro protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directive according to which, from September 1 of this year, insured motorists will be able to get cash payments without a GIDD certificate.
It is true that we are talking only about cases where the accident was registered according to the "Euro protocol" without the involvement of the traffic police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, no physical injuries were sustained, the damage was within the limit and both drivers agreed on who was to blame.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "euro-protocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1 in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often, even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be registered under the "Euro protocol", the drivers who have been involved in an accident call the DPS.
Because if you had a casco policy, you couldn't get compensation without a D.I.R.D. certificate.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive are designed to eliminate this obstacle to the implementation of the "Euro-protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum casco payment for an accident that is not paid by the DIGD should not be lower than the limit of the "Euro Protocol".
However, it cannot be more than the limit specified in the casco insurance contract.
The idea is certainly useful and could theoretically relieve both road and traffic officials.
But it's not likely to please motorists or insurance companies.
The latter are already talking about the serious threat of increasing fraud, which could result from the introduction of new rules on casco payments.
As for drivers, it's hard to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the inherent Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to report a minor accident, because that's more reliable.
And it's not clear which will be easier - defeating the fraudsters or convincing drivers of the reliability of the Euro Protocol.
The savings certificate will be made anonymous and irrevocable
The Treasury wants to ban the deposit-only savings certificates, but it's going to allow banks to make them the equivalent of a deposit.
The Treasury is drafting a bill that would ban the use of savings certificates.
The instrument has recently become popular, as rates are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the savings certificates for the depositor do not fit into the deposit insurance system, and the bank is cheaper, because you do not have to make any transfers to the deposit insurance agency (ASV).
The point is that this move is planned because of the small and medium-sized banks that distribute such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the ASV, control 98% of the market, will suffer.
The Bank of Moscow's share, according to the agency's calculations, is about 3.5%.
The problem, the FSA explains, is that customers of a small bank who buy such a certificate, if their license is revoked, try to get money in the FSA.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying proof-of-concept savings certificates, may assume that their deposits are insured.
The justified lack of insurance payments for these certificates in the event of a bank license revocation can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the agency's practice, there have been cases when holders of pre-emptive certificates have tried to collect insurance compensation through the court", the agency said.
The problem, of course, is made up.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of the certificates anyway, because they have no right to compensation from the state.
If the instrument were not insured by the SBA, metal accounts would be banned along with it, where citizens' funds are recorded in grams of one of four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
These accounts are not covered by the deposit insurance system either, but they are not being compromised.
The fact is, it's likely that the certificate of origin is a very convenient security that can actually act as a quasi-negotiator.
At the same time, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, give it to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no accident that the bill stipulates that a savings certificate must be a registered security, which must be kept in a depository.
And to make the banks sweeter, they're allowed to issue these certificates without the right to early repayment.
So, we're introducing the kind of deposit-free money that bankers have been dreaming about for a long time.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
There was a protest over the weekend against the NATO summit in Newport.
Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport on Saturday for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered outside Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-Semitic rally.
Stephen Fairclough followed the weekend for us and spoke to protesters who had come from all over, from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the militants of the terrorist group "Islamic State", reports ITAR-TASS on August 31 with reference to the decision taken at the meeting of the representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany is reported to be sending 30 Milan anti-tank missiles and 500 rounds of ammunition to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian aid.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will make a government statement on the subject in the Bundestag.
Germany has not yet deployed its weapons to hot spots.
The opinions of the people of Germany on the issue of sending weapons to Iraqis are divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop ISIS fighters, while others fear that these weapons could eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militia downed Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias have sunk a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, reports ITAR-TASS on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in the Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shiroquino and Bezymennaya (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media outlets report that two coast guard boats have been shelled.
It's been confirmed that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 MSK.
Teenagers picked up in a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bushwalkers were flown to safety by helicopter after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a hike shortly after noon Sunday at Govets Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8pm when they did not return home.
A search party was dispatched, including local police and a rescue team, and the pair were found around 11pm near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl hurt her knee, and the young man fell and hit his head.
Officers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were picked up on a lever Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountains Hospital.
Two unions have met
The Minsk summit did not resolve the problems for which it was convened, but it did give birth to a new format: the first leaders of the European Union met with the first leaders of the future of the Eurasian Economic Union.
Even if it was a worrying issue (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerating delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed a number of "hot issues" for the first time.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; however, it is clear who took the cream off this summit.
Questions about this fell away on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and then other Eurasians and Europeans saw the new president Lukashenko in the television news.
The Belarusian leader showed an example of fine courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who just broke the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in the higher society.
How the Maidan helped Lukashenko
The arrival in Minsk of three major European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - is not just legitimization of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is a request for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is confident that Brussels will no longer be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
"The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko gives us grounds to believe that relations with the EU will continue to thaw", he told "Ogyenk".
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparing for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results were achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogue on modernization, - lists the interlocutor of "Ogyenka", - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The States even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only fueled this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian airbase is located in Baranowice.
Brussels and Washington have noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and have assessed it, Belarusian experts are confident.
The extent to which Lukashenko's move towards political diversification will be successful will be seen by how often Minsk will be able to host meetings in the EU+TS format in the near future.
The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton, was unable to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from the new format of relations.
Ashton's press secretary, Maya Kosyanch, only told "Ognika" that this topic is not a priority in the context of resolving issues of war and peace.
There were reports that Kazakhstan could be the next venue for the meeting on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The key to Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked to do so by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all sides are not against Minsk remaining the central platform for meetings in the format of Russia-OSCE-Ukraine, as well as at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the "last dictator of Europe" is given the status of a fully-fledged European leader who is helping to solve a global problem.
Best friend of the European farmer.
The EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, had already pushed to the conclusion that the main undercurrent of the summit was not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
Indeed, the timetable for future gas talks and the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement looks more ambitious than peace declarations without specific dates or figures.
Trade Commissioner Karl De Gjucht, however, noted that EU representatives "came to Minsk to seek a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not the other way around".
However, it seems that the crisis in Ukraine is also working for Belarus.
Its consequences - and first and foremost the mutual sanctions imposed by the West and Russia - give Minsk, which is currently under sanctions pressure, a long-awaited space for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, ex-candidate to the presidency of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin at the summit has angered Minsk.
"The initiators of these schemes, - Romance emphasized "Ogenku", - are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They've been working on schemes for long time to supply goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today those schemes are broken.
Russian business is in dire need of somehow restoring them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second scenario, - continues the expert, - is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are willing to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion in exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand".
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and the TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU's agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, while the European Commission has currently offered only 125 million euros in compensation to farmers.
The Belarusian president could propose that Brussels work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko's authority in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality Without Initative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk is recusing itself from its active role in the birth of the format of the TC + EU, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that Kiev was the initiator of the new format.
"It was your proposal to meet, without any fuss to discuss, not from the bay to take a decision, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing in Ukraine at that time", he said in front of the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic ministry emphasizes that Belarus does not pursue selfish goals when it organizes EU-EU cooperation on its soil, and the ultimate goal of such a format is to create a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other spheres, in particular in the sphere of security, is put forward and promoted by the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation", - said "Ogeniku" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the department where in recent times scrupulously choose words.
Moscow could have a fee-paying zone
The Moscow government is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating the congestion of central roads, similar to other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru, citing the deputy mayor of Moscow for transportation issues Maxim Likusov.
One option that has proven itself is paid entry.
It's an expert opinion, we'll definitely look into it, see all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that any decisions have been made on this issue", - said Likusov.
Zamera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and traffic to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken by these countries is the construction of the central ring road, added Likusov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of why not all traffic needs to pass through Moscow.
If there was enough infrastructure to bypass, there would be no need to have transit traffic in Moscow", the deputy mayor noted.
Maxim Likustov also said that the introduction of paid parking places has significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
Recall that on August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, participated in the groundbreaking ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CADA).
Boredom is sinful .
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's Sin City 2: A Woman Worth Killing for was not the revolution you might expect.
The first "Sin City" (2005), filmed with minimal but symbolic participation by Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in the sense that it breaks the fundamental chain of thesis-antithesis-synthesis for modern thinking (if we mean the universe of noir by thesis, and the cosmos of comics by antithesis).
From now on, it should read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
Sin City 2 is chaotic on both the dramatic and philosophical levels: both times it's chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yeah, some of the characters are familiar with the first "City", although, here, he knocked Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, he ended his life on the electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to pull - in the role of this folk squad - from the air knives and other axes with whips.
But the old people are literally trampled on by the newcomers' elbows, like they've invaded the city from some other movie, the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry about.
So, his story, shamelessly cut by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His is the lustful frigid Eva Lord and the vengeful Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, where Dwight is, say, face-to-face with Johnny, especially since faces, like other body parts, are inflicted on characters with inexorable regularity, is not trouble, not even half trouble.
They're not people, we understand they're the archetypes of the noir: a doomed bitch, an overconfident gambler, a sex-trapped honey-trap detective, a corrupt, uptight senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, it's not cinema anymore, it's abstract painting.
And to ask an abstract painting about the logic of the plot is ridiculous.
Besides, even in this troubled world, there is something that is constant.
The war whores of the first City still hold a circular defense against the forces of darkness that besiege their native slums.
And the ghost of Detective Hartigan, no, no, he'll come and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always a good looker.
The main problem with Sin City 2 is different.
Frank Miller was good at brilliantly combining comics and noir as an artist, and as a director, he turned the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposed "realities".
The modern comic book phenomenon was born in the late 1920s, when Dashiell Hammett's novels Blood Harvest (1929), The Maltese Falcon (1930) and The Glass Key (1931) created the canon of the hard-boiled school, or "cool school".
Or pulp fiction.
Comics have given Hollywood dozens of heroes: from the sailor Poppy, the spinach-eater who gives him his richness, to Superman, Batman, and the detective Dick Tracy, to the Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man, and other "vengeful" characters.
But there was something damaging about any comic book movie: the characters were stubbornly unwilling to be portrayed, remaining a mere pretence in the world around them, whether they wanted to or not.
Simply put, they were utterly devoid of "existence".
Noir, on the other hand, is the most existential genre in world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all its credibility.
What kind of Forsyte, what kind of Tibor and Rugan Makkara, what kind of even Bolkovo and Rostov are even imaginable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
This novel was peacefully mutated into a soap opera, and the crime novel - which is by definition marginal - rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett learned firsthand what it was like to be a medic at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Loussi, Edward Dmytryk.
So the noir they've given us is, first, rude and cynical, and second, it's purely social.
It's almost like the American version of social realism.
The first Sin City was remarkable in that it unintentionally but organically connected comics with noir.
For the first time, the comic came to life, not being ashamed of its graphic nature, and not pretending to be a "real" film.
The darkness of a corrupt world where the cardinal ordered the murders and the senator covered up for the monster's sadistic son was well worth Hammett's pen.
And the picturesque details, like the severed heads that the sadist used to decorate his nest, the feathers of the brilliant James Ellroy, author of "The Black Orchid", and the best, if not the most, annoying representative of the neon.
Sin City 2 is not even a retreat, but a capitulation to Miller-Rodriguez's radical style to the comic book tradition.
I think a lot of it's because of 3D technology.
When you watch Sin City 2, you feel like you're trapped in a glass ball with snow trapping a toy sewer inside.
It's not snow, it's blood, but what's the difference?
Well, there's nothing to talk about socially.
Because it's only possible when somewhere, somewhere, sometimes, even on the edge of a dirt swamp, there's a normal world where you can bring back a girl who's gone off the rails, or, say, tell her despondent parents that her destroyer is being punished.
If there is no sin in the city, then it is not a sin, but a norm.
Boring as a rule.
The chaos of Sin City 2 is boring.
In fairness, the national rentals gave this fresh sin a little pepper.
The film's subtitles warn that the film contains harmful smoking scenes.
Compared to the most vegetarian episode, where a person's fingers are broken with a pinch, it's a hell of a comedy.
Hammett would have liked it.
France's socialists must "shut up and bring France back to order", says key ally François Hollande
Mr. Vallée urged deeply divided left-wing forces to "demonstrate warmth" to the attacking socialist president, whose re-enactments were not approved by the overwhelming majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay by his side", he said, to applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question France's controversial 35-hour workweek, despite contentious proposals, it should relax rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the Minister of Justice, put the wheels in the sand, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to "lose faith in the future".
Marine Le Pe, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among socialists, saying she did not imagine that the new government of Vallée would last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the naked king, but naked is Prince Manuel Valls, forced to assemble a new government when the previous one didn't last.
"The new one will not last either autumn or winter", Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win the snap election and was ready to govern.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by the Journal du Dimanche on Sunday found that 76 percent of French believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Mr. Hollande's presidency in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Sioux Powers University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to feel something is changing quickly", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Drug-Free City is not sued
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court left the claim of the administrative directorate of the regional ministry for the management of state property to the fund "City without drugs" without consideration.
The agency intended to collect from the organization more than 7 million rubles as a fee for the rental of a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice.
Today, the Sverdlovsk region arbitration court left the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) against the "City without Drugs" fund (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roizman) without consideration.
The representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles as rent payment.
It was announced today that the plaintiff failed to appear in court twice, which led to a decision to dismiss the case.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO directorate could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer the phone calls.
We haven't been able to contact the foundation either.
We are talking about a mansion that the foundation has occupied in the city center on Belinsky Street, 19 on a non-repayable basis since 2011.
This decision was made by ex-governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Sverdlovsk Regional Ministry of State Property Management filed a lawsuit against the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court for eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency was seeking through the court to recognize the unsigned contract of free use of the building.
According to the MUGISO directorate, the agreement did not contain any substantive terms for the rental of the cultural heritage.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court dismissed the claim, and an appeal was filed in the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was granted.
The Foundation then filed a cassation appeal against this decision in the same court, which was unsatisfied, and the decision was appealed by the Foundation to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court sided with the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, which led to the fund once again paying rent, said city mayor Evgeny Roizman.
The rent was set at 300 thousand rubles a month.
The previous county administration gave us this building for free, recognizing our service in the war on drugs, as a token of respect for the foundation.
The current administration decided otherwise", he said.
She is a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Why the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Was Offered to Leave Voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the Yekaterinburg city council Alexander Kosintsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city council Evgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against the arrested for the murder of a pensioner, the deputy of the city council Oleg Kinev, who is considered a collaborator of the mayor.
How Evgeny Roisman Found a Criminal Case
On July 1, it became known that a criminal case was initiated on the fact of "slander" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roysman.
This was reported in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Zachota" Anna Filatova addressed with a statement.
She said Mr. Roisman accused her in his blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
The iPhone will be turned into a wallet
In the run-up to September 9, when Apple is due to unveil its newest products, there are a lot of new leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
Citing sources, US media reports that the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet feature as a result of a joint project between Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and Re/code, Apple may announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express at the September 9th product launch, which will see the new iPhone 6 feature a mobile wallet.
The companies themselves declined to comment on the matter.
This function allows you to pay at the shop's cash register using your smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using Touch ID.
It is reported that the iPhone will be the first to incorporate NFC technology (near field communication), which allows you to make contactless payments using a smartphone and a corresponding cash register device.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
NFC was first introduced in 2004 as a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that were part of the NFC Forum, an association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first Android smartphone with NFC was the Samsung Nexus S, which was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced Google Wallet, which allows users to link their bank cards to their Google account and pay using an Android smartphone.
However, US experts point out that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in promoting NFC technology, US retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
So now observers are hoping that Apple's entry into this market will eventually force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their retail outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on the delivery of Mistral to Russia remains unchanged
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romène Nadal said Paris's position on the delivery of Mistral helicopters to Russia was unchanged.
"I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (François Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde on 20 August: 'Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent the supply.
This is a decision of Europeans, not France", Mr. Nadal quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
So the French Foreign Ministry replied to a question about whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine would affect the change of Paris' position on the implementation of this contract.

National Security Council of Ukraine: seven soldiers killed in the zone of the military operation
The representative of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, Andrei Lysenko, said that seven Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 25 wounded in the fighting zone in the east of the country over the past 24 hours.
The situation under Ilovaisk is extremely difficult.
Until the withdrawal operation is complete, the details will not be released.
After the operation, the loss and cause of the accident will be made public.
Those responsible for this situation will be held accountable", Mr. Lysenko added, refusing to discuss in more detail the situation near Ilovaisk, where several Ukrainian battalions were surrounded.
According to the representative of the National Security Service, "everything is being done to return the soldiers who were captured", reports ITAR-TASS.
Mr. Lysenko also noted that the Ukrainian military withdrew from Lugansk airport in the direction of the Georgiyevka settlement.

Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company, Prestige Cruises International Inc, for approximately $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market cap company, access to luxury cruise ships and secure Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise's shares.
Sources have requested anonymity as the negotiations are not open.
Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while an Apollo representative declined to comment on the information.
Norwegian Cruise, based in Miami, operates 13 cruise ships on routes covering North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India in the coming years.
The racing companies are looking to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with the US regulatory authorities for an initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's majority shareholder after an $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed as it exists today in 2000 by the merger of the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment and casino conglomerate controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok The.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company, as of the end of June, according to the filing.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public offering of Prestige Cruises' stock.
"Crimea" T.R.C. may receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia offers to allocate 250 million rubles to the state TV and radio company "Crimea" in 2014.
According to the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, which was posted on the single portal for disclosure of information on the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidies are planned to be spent "on covering the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of the modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea".
The money will also go towards the purchase of equipment, roof repair and energy supply systems in the building of the TV and radio company, founded in 1959, reports RIA Novosti.
Hong Kong democracy activists disrupt Chinese representative's speech the day after the election decision
A group of Beijing loyalists stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the All-China People's Congress on Sunday set out a procedure for allowing only two or three candidates to run in the 2017 Hong Kong leadership election.
All candidates must first win the support of a majority of the nominating committee, which will likely be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get on the ballot and has forced democratic activists to re-pledge to stop Hong Kong's financial centre with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a document by Beijing describing China's control over Hong Kong in June, pro-democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in the special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business center and staged a sit-in.
The briefing is being organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Congress Zhang Rongshun and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Bureau of the State Council Feng Wei were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings throughout the day.
Student activists said they would gather at the Hong Kong Prime Minister's building this afternoon.
The UK did not mention democratic rule for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River, which belongs to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is related to the desire to avenge the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
The Israeli Defense Ministry announced the seizure on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to Gaza Strip spokesman Saib Arikat, the international community should call on Israel to answer for "the continued settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem".
Putin demands that Kiev start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needed to be reviewed to give the Russian-speaking region an opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was consistent with the obvious strategy he has been following since the bloodshed began five months ago: to help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya de facto independence in order to draw closer to Russia, not the West.
In an interview with state-run First Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to retake the separatist-held territories in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the occupied territories Novorossiya, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops are attacking peaceful settlements in the separatist-held regions, is "a prisoner of illusions", ITAR-TASS reported.
"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, to respect the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's statements were meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict".
The Kremlin's intervention by a press secretary to correct the "false interpretation" of Putin's words underscored the Russian leadership's decision to behave in relation to the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population of 2 million are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia's mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia's main military fleet, as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between Russia's Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundry plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested during his June 7 inauguration speech that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections consider amendments to the constitution to give the separated regions more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from the view of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, who accuse Moscow of arming and inciting them.
Putin's latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed renewed rebel offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists have taken control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say is feared to be the start of a campaign to capture strategic coastal territory as far as Crimea.
This led to large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel-making port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the European Union leaders meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that was independent for 23 years.
"We are approaching the point of no return", warned Poroshenko.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take specific measures; the leaders called for drafting tougher sanctions against Russia that would be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support the troubled separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
The nude photo scandal has caught the eye of Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust at hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is in a frenzy after a series of candid nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence were leaked online in the wake of a massive celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker responsible for this is said to have about 60 candid photos of "The Hunger Games" star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strachowski and Greco, who lives in Melbourne, are also alleged to have had their photos stolen through an iCloud leak.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who made Greco's proposal last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting".
All private correspondence and photographs must remain private.
It's terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacking attack was "shameful" and that those targeted by it "feel like they've been invaded".
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying by the pool with her breasts exposed.
Palmer's film work includes Love and Honor with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of Chuck Strachowski and Forbidden Feast actress Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
Lawrence's spokesman told TMZ, "This is a brazen invasion of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Posting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different than selling stolen goods".
It's just that, legally, we can't have stolen photos published.
Potential way to steal nude celebrity photos
The massive hacking of the stars' accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The Next Web has described a potential scenario.
A Python script was published on Github that allowed users to select passwords for Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of an iPhone.
It uses the same login and password as the iCloud cloud from which the celebrity photos were stolen.
The script allowed the method of searching to find the password from Find My Phone.
This method involves sequentially entering all possible combinations of symbols, starting with the most frequently used passwords.
The script author claimed that the number of password options you can enter on Find My Phone is unlimited.
With a properly configured security system, after several failed attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and notify the user of the hacking attempt.
Because of the vulnerability, users have not received any messages about attempts to access their account passwords.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a scripted password-selecting program was written to it.
At this point, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted a Hackapp user who noted that the aforementioned vulnerability is common to many services, but noted that he has no evidence that this is the vulnerability that was used to access the Stars account.
It wasn't me, please RT
Twitter of the Prime Minister has once again been blocked by foreigners
While there is no hard evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using the service in the past.
Hackers were taking control of the device and demanding ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
In Russia, the Twitter account of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was also hacked earlier.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the way described above, then there could be a password for the government's chief's account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web was unable to get any comments from Apple regarding the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-time champion
Russian President Vladimir Putin has granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The relevant decree is published on the legal information website.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and asked the Federation of Modern Five-A-Mixing to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two World Cup stages, won the silver medal at the European Championships in the individual event and became the world champion in mixed relay, which is one of the newest programs in this sport.
She's holding the lead this season.
According to the rules, to compete at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to get a special permit from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change her citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to give a Russian passport to the chess player Ekaterina Lagno - a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world champion in blitz (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, she won the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the World Team Championship in Astana (2013) and the European Team Championship in Warsaw (2013).
The Crimean Crime Commission stopped investigating the Tu-204 crash in Vnukovo
The Russian Investigative Committee (RIC) has terminated the criminal case over the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the aircraft commander and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the crash was increased landing speed, failure of the crew to follow standard procedures at landing, as well as accidental release of the engines to increased direct-pull speeds.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline, which was flying Prague - Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 while landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft went off the runway and caught fire.
The captain of the aircraft, the co-pilot and the flight engineer were killed.
Two of the flight attendants were taken to medical facilities, where they later died of their injuries.
Three other flight attendants were hospitalized with severe injuries and underwent long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, which was moving at the time of the disaster on the Kiev highway, suffered serious injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The Transportation Prosecutor's Office conducted a review of the Red Wings after the crash, which revealed numerous violations.
In February 2013, the airline's license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelianenko has started training in the detention center
The famous Russian mixed martial artist, 33-year-old Alexander Yemelianenko, who is in the detention center for allegedly sexually assaulting a domestic worker, has fully recovered from his injuries and started training.
This is what Championate reports.
In May of this year, the Russian Investigative Committee charged Alexander Yemelianenko with rape.
The suspect was declared wanted, he was detained in Tambov on May 9 after committing a road traffic accident, which resulted in him getting a broken hip.
Yemelyanko Jr. was placed under arrest until August 31, and sentenced on September 1.
However, the trial was postponed, and the investigation insisted on extending the detention period until September 30.
If the athlete is found guilty, he could face up to six years in prison.
What's the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in the career of Alexander Yemeliaenenko
His last fight was in January of this year, losing to his compatriot Dmitry Sosnovsky by technical knockout.
Alexander is the younger brother of the more famous fighter Fedor Yemelianenko.
The latter is a four-time world champion in mixed martial arts, four-time world champion and seven-time champion of Russia in martial samba.
Anger has turned out to be the most universal and functional emotion of man .
Angry facial expressions are biologically universal to humans, and each organ and muscle group involved in their creation is not random, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers from Australia and the United States found.
Their findings were reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and a brief summary of their findings can be found in a press release from the University of California, Santa Barbara.
Angry facial expressions - downward-turning eyebrows, thin lips, and puffy nostrils - are the same in all cultures, and are made by children who are blind from birth and have never seen them, notes lead author Aaron Sell.
In a large research project on the nature of anger, scientists found that anger was a key factor in effective conflict management.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his own terms, and he conveys this to the other person through anger.
The researchers also found evidence for another hypothesis: Physically strong people are more likely to be angry and violent, feel entitled to impose unfair conditions on others, and prefer violent conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining", the researchers decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that produce the angry facial expression should represent the angry individual as more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the other person - and thus force him to agree to his terms as soon as possible to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modeled faces on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry face were present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although a lowered eyebrow or a raised chin alone did not make the face look ugly, the study participants were unanimous in their recognition that a person with such features was physically stronger.
Human anger, like animal anger, is a threat: an exaggerated display of power that forces consent and submission.
A human inflates his nostrils and clenches his lips for the same purpose as a frog inflating itself or a baboon displaying its fangs.
"Anger is triggered by the refusal of the other person to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes on a form that demonstrates the consequences of that refusal to the other side as effectively as possible.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry face are arbitrary, they all express the same thing", noted anthropologist John Tubby.
Ministry of Communications offered to allocate 250 million rubles to the "Crimea" TV and radio company
The Ministry of Communications proposed to allocate 250 million rubles from the federal budget to the autonomous non-profit organization "Crimea" Teleradio Company".
This is stated in the draft government resolution prepared by the department, which "Lenta.ru" has read.
According to the explanatory note to the project, subsidies from the federal budget will be directed "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the social and economic situation and the development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea, including the purchase of equipment".
In particular, the money is intended to re-equip the hardware-studio block, video walls, central hardware and video server.
It is also planned to purchase a mobile television station and a satellite transmitter.
The company will also use the money to pay for the use of fiber-optic communication lines (FOPLs) and for repairs to the energy system.
The subsidies will be provided within the limits of the federal budget, provided for the Ministry of Communications.
The state-run TV and radio broadcasting company "Crimea" was established in 1959 and broadcasts in seven languages: Ukrainian, Russian, Crimean Tatar, German, Greek, Bulgarian and Armenian.
Today, the television signal of the TV and radio company covers more than 75 percent of the peninsula.
In 2011, the "Crimea" TV company received a license to broadcast in digital format.
