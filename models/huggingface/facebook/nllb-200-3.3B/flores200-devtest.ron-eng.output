This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs were covered with feathers, a widely held hypothesis, but it also provides details that generally cannot be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brown-brown on the upper side, with a light or orange color on the lower side.
The discovery also provides a glimpse into how bird feathers evolved.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called a rahis, but exhibit other features characteristic of feathers  beards and barbels , researchers concluded that the rahis was likely an evolutionary development following the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for impression. The researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not chick feathers.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows an adult plumage and not the pubic of a chick.

They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system has been shown to be driven by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star will be in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to stimulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would have been caused by the large forces produced between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the Arrow galaxy.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy like a kind of aura and is composed of a lot of small particles.

 They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but is consistent with the hypothesis that they represent deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeology Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a rather technical experience: voters lock themselves in a booth and insert a pre-printed piece of paper into an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, he leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law rather strictly codifies the procedures to be followed.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can confirm that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send their representatives to witness all stages of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following clear procedures.

Four female sit-ins failed to complete their lap, and 45 of the 117 giant slalom skiers failed to secure a spot in the competition.
Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in front of the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car hit it, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed until emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court.
She was held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be altered, as her image was widely published.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts have decided that the publication of the photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists seem to be playing with fire by publishing photos and other information about suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is charged with the criminal prosecution, has told reporters that it will not comment further at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute, which Palestine wants drawn based on the pre-Middle East 1967 borders.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a sacred place for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel claims that after signing the agreement, it will have a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years, while the PA agrees to accept this presence only for a period of five years.
The hunters taking part in the additional pest control test were to be closely supervised by the foresters, the test being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Hunter Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited from the Sport Hunter Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Executive Director for Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunt operation received comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), consisting of nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to steer the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been approximately 60 cases of overheating of malfunctioning iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MECI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 more overheating incidents, which the company said were "not serious".
'The Ministry responded, saying that the delay on Apple's part was 'really regrettable.'
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau said no damage was reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has stated that there is no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong, hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and so far at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, along with the Filipino photographs.
Later, the photos were replaced by an elderly woman who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
She trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working for the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research premature labor in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate the lung maturation of the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The wrestlers' brotherhood also paid tribute to the Moon.
Tommy Dreamer said that Moon was the first Queen of Extremes. My first manager. Moon died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, as she was. A strong woman.
"Dustin Runnels, nicknamed the 'Golden Powder,' commented that 'the Moon was as eccentric as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's in a better place.'"
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic after Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of those surveyed agree with this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme ends of the poll, 29% of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim at the Commonwealth Games, in the 100 m and 200 m freestyle events, as well as in three relay events, but his fitness was called into question due to his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication needed to control the pain, as it was forbidden during the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery before the beginning of February, using various combinations of hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
The comet may have been the source of water supply to the Earth, along with organic matter, which can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as representing "political nonsense and nonsense".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and lowering carbon emissions.
It uses technology that relies on the use of satellites, as opposed to older systems based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft and transmit more precise information to pilots.
There are no additional means of transport available, surface trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and car parking facilities linked to public transport are not available in the area.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have raised the possibility of holding the game behind closed doors, in the absence of the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the development of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer, due to the breeding between the endemic Darwin's cyntesis, Geospiza fortes, and an immigrant cactus cyntesis, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into a multitude of patterns, rolled into tiny objects.
It can be pulled into thin threads that can be twisted and braided, beaten with a hammer or laminated into sheets.
It can be made very thin and glued onto another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
He mixes the two powders together, and then with his clean, wet hands, he forms a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which can give you a strange feeling and lead to the formation of a kind of crust.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets in almost every house, attached to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewer systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and in the Romans, toilets were sometimes found as part of public baths, which men and women used jointly.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you do it through a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and then reflects it back, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket, 100 feet high, to carry a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is that it has made transportation much easier and much faster.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them we have several medium-sized caterpillars, feeding on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of the niche; each feline has its own role to play, so it's not in competition with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called packs.
Families consist of one to three related adult males, along with up to thirty females and chicks.
Females are usually related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion families behave very similarly to wolf packs or dogs, animals with surprisingly lion-like behavior (but not other large felines), and also very lethal to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump for long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only felines that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence of sharp, shouted words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than the ocelot.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and find food by scent, sniffing the ground to find it.
With their night vision, they can see very well in the dark and can move undetected.
When a small group of animals (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or if it moves to a new island from which it cannot easily return), it will often find itself in a different environment from the one in which it was before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say they're the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (i.e., expel from the lungs).
Plants produce food by the sun, through photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make clothes from plants and most of the food we eat is plants and without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, fearing nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long tusks had over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, meaning that nothing in its path got away with it.
We don't know for sure, but he could have had a forked tongue, and his diet included turtles, large fish, other species of mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
They also attack anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex could have taken them.
While much of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included boars, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called a plover.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate sitting on the stools, the rich men liked to make banquets where they sat reclining on one side while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include dishes that arrived in Europe, America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cacao, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was the sanctuary of the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was less important.
Most of the life of a Jewish family is spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the backyard; shops were just counters that faced the street; houses were built in stone.
The land of Canaan had no forests, so the wood was very expensive.
Greenland was little colonized. In the Scandinavian saga, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and while traveling further west, found the Greenland and named it Greenland.
But whatever discoveries he made, tribes of Eskimos were already living in those places at that time.
Although they were all Scandinavian countries, there were many differences in the population, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a written inscription on the back, it is not a treasure map.
 On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words:  The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776 appear inverted at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for certain who wrote it, it is known that, in its early days, the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) had been kept rolled.
The marking was therefore probably done for labelling purposes only.
The D-Day landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
It was run by the French from Vichy, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American forces joined with the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were moving towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state; it also defines in a way the size of society.
Cities and states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural footprint and a reasonable spread.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the Revolution, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress as its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and because there was no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its decisions.
Nor did he have the authority to override laws and interstate tax rates.
The Articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
 Due to the island groups that Japan has, it is often said that Japan is, geographically speaking, an archipelago.
The beginning of Taiwan was long ago, in the 15th century, when European sailors passing by the island, recorded the name as Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on sugar and rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1985, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which had governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to allow tourists to form a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, its proportions have been taken over by the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format, somewhat confusingly, is actually 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore stated to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are identical to or very close to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and often ridiculed, is nothing more than a simple suggestion to create dynamism while maintaining some order in an image.
According to this, the best place for positioning the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the frame into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, drew attention to itself.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has bound European states to each other, despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power has affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds exist specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many question whether the principle was really being followed.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law provisions enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral ships.
The response to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its unconquered submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with only 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his previous boss) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delineating different time periods; each stage of China or each family that held power represented a distinct dynasty.
The best-known such interval was the Three Kingdoms Period, the 60-year period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods there were bitter wars between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest times in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the throne in the great palace at Xi'an.
It had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist one, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, men were able to access all occupations, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
So did the military, because instead of armed hierarchy based on class, they now relied on caliber.
The French Revolution, in turn, inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond the worldly, and he would often go to meditate in a cave that came to be known as Hira, located on Mount Noor (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it exists.
The only things you can see are the clear, beautiful skies above and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has remained standing to this day.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, also called the Giza Necropolis, in the Valley of the Dead, Egypt, is home to several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the tallest), several smaller tombs, a number of temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The  upward stroke looks like a V, and the  downward stroke looks like a cap or square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you have to start at the top and push the bow; down means you have to start at the frog (i.e. the side where you grab the bow with your hand) and pull the bow.
An upward bowstring usually produces a softer sound, while a downward one is stronger and more determined.
Feel free to mark your own indications, but remember that the printed indications for the arches are there for musical reasons and normally, must be followed.
On 6 October 1789, the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Marie Thérèse, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchants to return from Versailles to Paris.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd shouting and shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to leave the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd raised the head of a member of the royal guard, killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of the United States imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to support much of the expenses and interest of the bonds put into the name of the Philippine government by the banking houses on Wall Street.
Of course, the enormous profits from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were the basic gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The period in which the events unfold is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, representing the epoch in European history comprising the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative, to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an afferent logic, associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development itself follows a path largely outside of cultural and political influence and that technology in turn has effects on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the machine necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of ownership of cars.
A large number of car owners leads to an increased incidence of accidents on public roads, which leads to the invention of new medical techniques for healing bodily injuries.
An important component of Romanticism was cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and cultures related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place occupied by society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began to spread through 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned laden with gifts such as silks and spices more valuable than the Byzantine market.
This was the moment when the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was heavily influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of that period was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often ecological, system that uses preserved seeds from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or sex of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of distinctive style, which includes fashion, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways that people use to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from a few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Such children are called "untamed" or "savage". Some wild children have been abducted by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child was due to the rejection of the child by the parents, due to severe intellectual or physical deficiencies.
It's possible that wild children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Some are believed to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived alone in the wild.
The feral child, when raised entirely by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (in its physical limits) almost entirely like those of the animal that nursed it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the trick goes a little further.
The scaffolding or jobsite method is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to people going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the little man-graph in Microsoft Office.
Virtual schedules are built into the software, serving to interrogate, offer clues and explain procedures that otherwise might be too complicated for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to extortion.
There shouldn't be children growing up in an environment where they're deprived of food, love and education, but there are.
We perceive the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our family care system must provide safe housing, caring caregivers, sound education and reliable health care.
Family care is supposed to meet the needs of children that were not met in the home they were previously in.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The other distinctive features of the Internet introduce additional dimensions in terms of approach to types of use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialisation are suggested as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuous relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is argued that one can tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-facial expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The President's Speech", showed how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes them from the set of expressed variations.
Separation and recombination cause one or the other of the two genetic backgrounds to dominate the direction of variation in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has a hard time meeting its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources were the proteins in the leaves and legumes, but these are hard to digest for primates like us if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (fungi, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Given all this, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the protein problem in a way similar to the chimpanzees on the savannas today.
Sleep disruption is the procedure by which you intentionally wake up during normal sleep in order to fall back to sleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you into a conscious state without fully waking you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it across the room, forcing yourself out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking liquids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bedtime, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.
The inner peace that a person feels is inversely proportional to the tension in one's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and everyone has the possibility of finding absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is your own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but with the addition of the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it's all about Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing the various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to collaboration between the USSR and the U.S. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process and culture led to the two countries' estrangement.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last for forty years and be fought in earnest, by 'delegated' armies, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already collapsed, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, the plans became futile almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers were mobilized creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport both goods and people from one side of the oceans to the other.
Traditionally, the navy's role has been to secure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using submarines in particular, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in taking Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Cults and tribes in ancient times began to keep them near the house for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, usually in the care of a few heifers who were often children or teenagers, similar to the well-known sheep herders. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways have been built in England since the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of wooden planks laid in parallel, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on the slightly more erratic roads of the time.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to hold the rails in place, but it was eventually realized that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band on top.
This became a widespread practice, but the iron made the wooden wheels of the wagons wear out more quickly.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were produced.
The first known means of transportation was walking; humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessor, Autralopithecus, did not typically walk upright.
Biped specialization is encountered in fossils of 4.2-3.9 million-year-old Australopithecus, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedally seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some future suffering.
This is the same as symptomatic treatment in many cases, however, if we don't want just a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems and we should disable them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly as a result of scientific and technological advances, and the problems are now greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten note, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing press, located a few blocks away.
 During the night, between 150 and 200 babies were made, known as postere Dunlap.
On July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th, and a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap posters that are still extant are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But in birds, you can still see many features similar to dinosaurs.
They have scaled feet and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can contain only one of the two values 0 or 1, and the designation of these numbers is binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The best indication for internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term "rodent" is used by entomologists for this particular group of insects.
The term originates in the ancient resemblance of bedbugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both Assassin's beetles and bed bugs are nidiculous, adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to develop MS.
A couple may conclude that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
These couples may choose to formulate an adoption plan for their child.
In the case of an adoption, the natural parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main purpose of science is to figure out how the world works using the scientific method, which is applied in most scientific research.
It's not the only one though, experimenting and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have made their primary use of classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted in all aspects of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The body clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run for a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment represented one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments marking either the bacteriophage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in the germline type cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in any other part can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism organized around nature exploration attracts interested people to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example would be visiting, photographing and learning more about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural settlements to their workplaces, passing others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon-based economy has dislocated the biosphere from one of its stable states that has sustained human evolution for the last two million years.
They all participate in society and use transportation systems.
Similar levels of dissatisfaction with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in developed countries.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such discontent, why do they fail day after day? Is it because transportation engineers are simply incompetent? Or is there something worse going on?
Traffic flow studies the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
Studying traffic flow is unfortunately difficult, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with absolute precision.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to stay within a reasonable constant; therefore, traffic flows tend to be reasonably constant and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the flow of traffic, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for the planning, design and operation of road installations.
Insects were the first animals to start flying, and their ability to fly allowed them to evade enemies more easily and to find food and mates much more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Nowadays, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and ephemeris.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought otherwise; namely that the Solar System actually revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
It seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying over eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at places six miles wide.
No less than 20 percent of the water that flows into the oceans from the rivers of the planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects the water of thousands of smaller watersheds.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in size and technical construction prowess.
The ancient Egyptians who lived during the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments built by their predecessors, which by that time were already over a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those working in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are Roman Catholic.
Humans have known some fundamental chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, since ancient times, because they can be found in nature in their native state and are fairly easy to mine using simple tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: water, earth, air, and fire.
He was more concerned with the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had theorized that it would change into another substance to take the form we see.
Alloy is actually a combination of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals.
You'll see that some alloys can also include small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny, that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, the pencil became the friend of many after it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer writing instruments became available, the pencil lost its status and number of uses.
People now type messages on computer screens without ever having to put their hand on a sharpener.
You can't help but wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart up a hill, breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impulse.
The surface of the moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shelf is about 70 km wide at its nearest point and 100 km wide at its farthest point.
It's thinner under the sea and thicker in the higher-lying areas.
There might be more marsh on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people's attention or pleasure.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into adulthood.
These theories study what makes people want to do what they do and what in their environment may or may not make them do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two types of behavior can occur when managers start leading their former colleagues: One extreme is trying to remain one of the boys (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, people turn into unrecognizable individuals who think they have to change everything the team has done and do it their own way.
After all, the leader is the one primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
And often, this behavior leads to rifts between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for the physical group they are part of.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be freely manifested.
As a result, the process by which an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to an innovative process to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The data from neurobiology is physical evidence that underpins a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, and as such, it allows for narrowing the area of research and defining it with greater precision.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain brain functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that were previously unseen.
It gives us a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While AI has strong science fiction connotations, it is a very important part of computer science, dealing with behavior, learning and adapting intelligence to machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such actions have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, but has also been used in some software applications for personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom, and oftentimes, a teacher would love to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
Technology is providing the solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year the students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, every year the website is remodeled, and the previous versions are kept online, to serve as an album.
Blogs can also improve a student's writing skills.While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally has the power to change the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make an effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them. The need to respond to the interests of their audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs can help students to think more analytically and critically; by actively responding to material found on the Internet, students can define their own position in the context of what others have written, as well as shape their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, offering a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of the Muskoka district and more.
These and many others highlight Ontario as representative of what foreigners consider Canadian par excellence.
Larger portions to the north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost unpopulated wilderness.
To make a population comparison that surprises many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States is greater than the entire population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a true continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are renowned as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam to those lands, which was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman traveling say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's fine to wear the wedding ring, but don't make it look expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what may be considered harassment and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed, etc.
Be decisive when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences or not, it's still not OK!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Marini, being called Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, who rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, but abandoned it again in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tajine, pottery, pilgrimage objects, hookahs and a lot of all kinds of trifles, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the settlement's streets, especially the downtown area.
While Goma is a fairly safe place to visit outside the city, an informative effort is required to understand the state of the fighting that is still being waged in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for the climbing of Nyiragongo volcano, also offering some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
The boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) can be used to travel through Goma. The usual (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to be used metaphorically to mean exotic, distant places.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, though its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the danger posed by desert sand.
He was one of the main hosts during the PBS special of Henry Louis Gates, Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities, as it has an Arab flair more than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bounded by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 (11,500 sq mi) and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the emblem of the country's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It may also be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which allows entry to either a number of South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, and many tourists look to it as their focal point.
The display of buildings contributing to Hong Kong's skyline has been likened to a glowing bar chart that is enhanced by the presence of Victoria Harbour waters.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon, on the other side of the water.
The largest area of the urban developed part of Hong Kong Island is crammed into reclaimed land along the northern coasts.
This is the space that the British colonists appropriated and therefore for anyone looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, however - they also contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third is aft water/marsh.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has become a sanctuary for wildlife and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses connecting districts are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coastal buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby destinations such as Paro (150 Nu) or Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
With its two pillars rising to a height of 272 feet, it is 1,100 feet (378 m) long and has two 12 feet (3.5 m) wide strips.
The free-way height on the underpass is 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the "Gigantic Province of the Indians", was born in the 16th century after the Spanish conquistadors encountered the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the city of Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has maintained, with effort, much of its indigenous specificity and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Tournaments and smaller matches also take place here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is set at the equivalent of 1 Pound Sterling (GBP).
You can change money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely to be unacceptable, although British and American currency may be accepted; contact the owners in advance to find out what means of payment they accept.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands pounds outside the country, so you have to exchange them before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures frequently reach above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively frigid: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived cold more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly 'wet' or 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains about the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must keep a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wild animals!
No matter how docile it may seem, the buffalo, the elk, the bear, and almost all other large animals can attack a man.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so it's good to give them their space.
In addition, be aware that the smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so it would be advisable to avoid strongly smelling food and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, and is located on the island of Upolu, with a population of almost 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a sadly remembered naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III supreme commander.
There are many beaches, thanks to the fact that Auckland is between two ports. The most famous of these are in three areas.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are almost all sandy beaches, where you can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a wide array of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is Number One; it is not a complex beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one. The other local beer is called Manta.
There's plenty of French wines to be had, but New Zealand or Australian would be better.
The local tap water is drinkable, but if you are apprehensive you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is unusual. A short black coffee is an "espresso", a cappuccino comes full of eyes with cream (no foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards, the fruit juices are spicy as price, but very good.
Many visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April in the north of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles don't actually live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport or even packages that combine flights and hotel accommodation.
They can also keep you booked if you need time to think about the offer or to procure other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be addressed primarily to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this to be an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to catch a camping spot near the music.
Remember that, even though the music on the main stages is over, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, be aware of the cabin's location, as navigating through the ice makes an unbearable noise for the most sensitive.
Cruise in St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
As a general rule, casinos make every effort to maximize the time spent by customers and the money spent by them.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment, to keep the mood and guests staying in the premises.
Some bars will serve alcohol on the house, but drinking can affect judgment, and good players know the importance of keeping their wits about them.
Drivers of high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possible presence of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive like on dry asphalt.
During a blizzard, in a very short period of time, enough snow may fall to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or snowdrift or condensation, or ice formation on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic is largely continuous throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa's premier tourist attraction and the highlight for many visitors.
The word safari, as it is commonly used, refers to the overland voyages undertaken to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially those of the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants or giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for good viewing of them.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bushwalking, hiking safari, or walking) consists of hiking either for a few hours or for a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations within Japan.
Tokyo, which also hosted the 1964 Olympics, will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics.
If you have booked your 2020 flight tickets and accommodation before the postponement is announced, you may face a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, the coronavirus cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to events will cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7000.
Many hotels have a flat iron and an ironing board that you can borrow, even if they are not in the room.
If you do not have an iron available or if you do not like to wear socks with irons, then you can try using a hair dryer if you have one at hand.
Be careful not to let the material overheat (which may cause contraction or, in extreme cases, burn).
There are many ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for one minute, in others, several minutes are required.
Filters vary in their efficiency, and if you're worried, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that are unfamiliar to them at home.
Pests can alter food, cause irritation or, in severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that may injure or kill a human being using physical force are not generally considered to be pests.
Duty-free shopping offers you the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travellers who are to visit high tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts, especially when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The portion between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult traffic conditions on the entire Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often crossing through isolated and unmanaged areas.
If you are used to driving on country roads, don't lose control: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and dangerous curves are common.
The speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous sections  generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and it is all the more important that they are strictly respected.
Yet, bizarrely enough, the cell service is much stronger here than along many other portions of the route, e.g. Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit confectionery is common, with apples being used throughout the year, and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and the popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a food based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be dry or lichid depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry sauces; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
Used without any other qualifier, however, the term tended to indicate the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island, Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is characterized by a number of dishes that are simply seasoned, with the predominant flavours preferred by Javanese being peanuts, sweet peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various flavoured spices.
The ladders support the rider's feet, hanging from either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but can pose safety problems, as it is possible for a rider's legs to get stuck in them.
If a rider falls from his saddle but is left with one foot hanging on the ladder, the horse may drag him along as he goes in pursuit.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stair straps to detach from the saddle if they are pulled back by a rider falling off the saddle.
Cochamó Valley - the most sought-after place for mountaineering in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of walls and high granite peaks.
The peaks offer breathtaking views from their summits, and climbers from all over the world are continually charting new routes through the walls with unlimited potential.
Sliding sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
 Skiing is a major tourist activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes called ski bums in English, who organize their entire holidays around skiing in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old. We have cave paintings of skiers from before 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called skiing in unmarked areas, skiing on shifts or skiing on skis.
It is a related activity, but usually not involving alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter being carried out on much steeper terrain and requiring much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
In good conditions, you'll be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking  but very rarely will you be able to reach typical deep-skiing speeds without a heavy backpack in the back, on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport control procedures repeatedly.
In this sense, the Schengen Area is organized in a way as one country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross the border without having to do so at passport control.
Similarly, a Schengen visa holder does not have to obtain a visa for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is considered antique goods, and some tax authorities consider antiques to be more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographic location, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, although they are newer than similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of income among the Sami, and trade-related culture is also important for many who have other occupations.
However, traditionally not all members of the Sámi population were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, but lived off fishing, hunting and the like, using reindeer more as beasts of burden.
Nowadays, many Sami have modern occupations, and tourism is an important source of income for Sápmi, the Sami area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word gypsy is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and an incorrect perception of the Roma population.
If the country you are going to visit is covered by a traveller's warning, it could affect your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments other than your own, but their advice is for their citizens.
One example would be how American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
Opinions are often presented in a superficial, general and oversimplified way, compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
'Extreme weather' is a generic term used for any type of dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world and are of many types, depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, heavy rainfall and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are storms, tornadoes, sea tornadoes and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms.
Travellers are advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in the area as it could upset their travel plans.
It is recommended that anyone planning to travel to a country that may be considered a war zone receive professional training.
A search on the Internet for "hostile environment courses" will likely provide you with the address of a local company.
Normally, a course will address all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually through practical experience.
A course will usually last between 2-5 days and will include role-playing, much first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are quite plentiful, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery in another country must ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Opening up governments to the possibility of issuing passports on which the gender (X) is not stated or documents updated to match the desired name and gender is variable.
The willingness of foreign governments to accept these documents varies as much.
Checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through the scan without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Back currents are the back-flow to the ocean from waves breaking on the beach, often at a reef or similar formation.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections and there a fast current can be formed towards the deep waters.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion in trying to swim back against the current, which may prove to be impossible.
Once out of the current, swimming is no more difficult than normal.
Try to move into a position where you're not trapped again, and depending on what skills you have and whether or not anyone saw you, you might want to wait to be rescued.
The shock of returning home manifests itself more quickly than the culture shock (it lasts less than the euphoria of the honeymoon), it lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travellers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes face particular difficulties in re-adapting to their native culture.
If you returned home after living abroad, you would have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first moved abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that visiting a new country requires a process of adaptation.
The world does not always expect that patience and understanding are required for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most exciting things for kids in the whole area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them silently before the show starts.
The noise of tourists and vendors is usually heard all the time, and the sound and light show seems to have been taken from a storybook.
The sphinx is used as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen being active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingstone Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
The southern part of the peninsula, which is bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.
The Peninsula Mountains join to give rise to this plateau, then split again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the north, called the Sentinel chain, lies the highest mountains in Antarctica, Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson rising to 12,950 feet (4,892 m).
In remote locations without phone service, a satellite phone might be your only option.
A satellite phone generally cannot take the place of a cell phone, because you have to be outside with an unobstructed view of the satellite to be able to make a call.
The service is commonly used in maritime transport, including by pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions requiring the remote transmission of data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider may be able to give you more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular alternative for people planning a year-long holiday is to combine travel with study.
It is a popular activity especially among graduates, allowing them to take a year off before attending a university, without jeopardizing their educational path.
In many cases, enrolling in a year-long course abroad can even increase your chances of accessing higher education in your home country.
Normally, there is a tuition fee that is paid upon enrollment in these educational programmes.
Finland is a wonderful place for boating. The land of a thousand lakes also has thousands of islands, both in these lakes and in the archipelagos off the coast.
In archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the archipelagos off the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller craft or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is Finland's national recreational activity, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
This happens in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is 1 to forty).
Most dedicated Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a few days, returning to the ship at night to sleep.
If you go ashore only on excursions aboard a ship, you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009)
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is by no means close to the sea and the visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and all backgrounds, especially if they are flying for the first time or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's not unlike the fears and personal aversions to other things that manifest in so many people.
For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight may help to overcome the fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery. Often, delivery time is critical in terms of documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies owned their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies had a problem.
If they've sent something by air, on some routes it can take days to unload and clear.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as checked baggage.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, convince your airline to do it for you).
But it's not cheap: in general, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times more for first class!
In general, there is no point in looking for business or first class discounts for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of getting somewhere fast and comfortable, and they charge fares accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from inter-ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The dominant religion of Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
İzmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transport hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a bustling, developed and modern commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, along with the glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres, are endowed with traditional 18th-century red-tiled roofs as well as old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views over the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble carvings of pigeons above some graves.
It's worth spending half an hour walking through this amazing village.
To the north, easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became beyond the country's borders following Lord Byron's enthusiastic tour of its splendors.
The 403 Scottburb bus makes regular trips to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also in the north you can visit the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Fatima, a place known throughout the world for the apparitions of St. Mary.
Please note that you are basically visiting the site of a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.

You are asked to treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Don't vandalize the place by drawing and scratching on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and practically all know Spanish.
However, most of the panels are only made in Catalan, as this is established by law as the first official language.
However, the Spanish language is widely used in public transportation, among other services.
Periodic announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected interruptions are announced by an automatic system in different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, unpolitical and arrogant.
Although it is often just a stereotype that does not correspond to reality, to have a pleasant stay in Paris it is good to behave as well as possible, like someone who is bien élevé (well-bred). It will help you to cope with much more ease. 
The reserved attitude of the Parisians quickly turns into a friendly one if you show a minimum of politeness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It is home to a considerable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soil types and altitude levels.
The region also harbours an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat and mountain rooster can be found here, along with many other more common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders as well.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in bright colors, you'll receive a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
And these can be borrowed from the ones available at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, greens and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used in abundance.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summertime, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil and tomatoes, with any spices available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the word Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even within the sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some verbs from objects.
It also undoubtedly makes reading easier, although the writing is somewhat complicated by the need to discover the possibility of a verb or adjective being used in a substantified form.
Pronunciation of Italian words is relatively easy, most being pronounced exactly as they are written
The letters you should be more careful about are c and g, because their pronunciation varies with the vowel after them.
Also, make sure you pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar manual will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Obviously, a person who knows a Romance language will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may jump to the premature conclusion that Portuguese is sufficiently close to not needing to be studied.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today and remain open as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their heyday as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, and are more easily accessible than those built in our time.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations located in isolated areas with favorable weather conditions.
The cherry blossom sight, known as hanami, has been an integral part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor for himself and other members of the imperial court aristocracy.
Nowhere do plants look better than in their natural environment, so don't be tempted to pick just one of them.
If you visit a formal garden, collecting specimens will also result in your eviction, no questions asked.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where you can easily navigate and buy almost anything as soon as you get there.
But being in the "upper tropics", just a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to face both the heat (always) and the strong sun (when it's clear, less often).
There are also a few buses that head north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, along with their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not to Kiryat Arba, the nearby Jewish settlement.

For example, visit the castles of the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley or take a cruise to the sites of the Danube or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by both nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians throughout the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake, outdoors, watching the sunrise.
There are of course explanations for this tradition in Christian theology, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditionalist churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Holy Week, with congregations often gathering at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the distance from the mainland, the mammals were unable to make the journey, the result being that the giant tortoise is the main animal that grazes in the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas during winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon line.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be, more or less, dark at that hour.
Because the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is not so often a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars, too.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are the standard dress in business, and coworkers address one another by family name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is a key element, with emphasis on team effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers often have to get the approval of their superiors for all the decisions they make and are expected to follow the instructions of their superiors without question.
