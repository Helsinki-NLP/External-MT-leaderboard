Bikers respond lightning fast and prevent worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was slightly injured due to his quick reaction.
A motorist overlooks a biker
A 44-year-old woman was driving her VW from Merklingen at 9.30 p.m. and was trying to turn left on State Road 1230 towards Machtolsheim.
In this case, she overlooked the 24-year-old motorcyclist who was coming from Nelling.
Hand and foot brakes fly away in the collision
The biker tried to avoid the car, but it still ran in the rear of the vehicle.
The strain caused the hand and foot brake levers to be torn off the Suzuki and the driver was unable to pull the brake.
He was mentally present, driving his motorcycle into the green tires next to the freeway and rolling it out without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
The motorcyclist suffered an injury to his leg and had to be treated in a hospital.
Breastfeeding: Corona mass infection: 174 crop workers infected
After a massive coronavirus infection at a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, nearly 500 people are quarantined and banned from leaving the farm.
A security guard is monitoring the exit ban.
A total of 174 crop helpers were tested positive for the coronavirus variant Sars-CoV-2 during the series of tests, the Dingolfing-Landau Land Council Office said on Saturday evening.
"Unfortunately, to prevent further spread, we must take this step to protect the population", said Land Council Member Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Seven employees had previously been infected at the plant - this was the reason for the serial test.
The farm is a large vegetable garden that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers are only for storage.
Mamming is a rural community of about 3,300 people, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder called on the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected workers were separated from uninfected employees, and the premises are now surrounded by a barrier.
The Greens and the SPD shared responsibility for the state government.
The two opposition groups accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"This can be bitter revenge if such local infections are to be tackled and regional lockdowns are to be ordered", said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary director general of the Greens.
The SPD has a similar view: "We have already requested a special control programme for farms with crop helpers after the coronavirus outbreak at the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May", said environment expert Florian von Brunn.
'In particular, we believe that hygiene conditions at work and housing conditions must be strictly monitored.
Obviously, that didn't happen".
The outbreak was "with a message".
Aidenbachstrasse subway station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls to the trackbed after pushing
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstraße subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into a trackbed.
Obersendling - A dispute between two youth groups broke out at the Aidenbachstraße subway station at 4.15pm on Friday.
A passenger alerted the police, who approached with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich resident (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the side of the platform and fell into the trackbed.
Persons from the 17-year-old's group helped the fallen man climb off the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were further clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old first fled the scene, but his identity was later determined.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
Seehofer is calling for longer storage
The storage of the data in the reserve is currently suspended.
However, the Federal Minister for the Interior Horst Seehofer has called for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) has called for an extended storage of reserve data - six months instead of the planned ten weeks.
Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a swift change to the law.
Seehofer therefore intends to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He feels it is wise to "immediately make the necessary changes to the law now", the paper quoted the letter as saying.
The storage of the data is currently suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer wants the amendments to be implemented in advance so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report says.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would only be possible to make a reasonable assessment of the need for legal adjustments if the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer and the interior ministers of the countries had already called for data storage in June.
NBA: Strip club threat to Clippers star Lou Williams
It's exciting in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, basketball pro for the Los Angeles Clippers, reportedly left the tournament quarter at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, he was still at the Magic City strip club in Atlanta at night.
Williams, who reportedly admitted to visiting ESPN, is back in isolation, being tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for coming is Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is known in the NBA, already expressed his love for these very wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA has ordered Williams to quarantine for 10 days.
This means the Clippers star will miss the first two official games after the Test.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the end of the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season finale, which begins Friday night.
Söder comments on the coronavirus situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) announced a test offensive on large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The Mamming case in Dingolfing-Landau County has shocked authorities and politicians.
The large vegetable farm is currently staffed by nearly 500 crop helpers from several countries, with over a third infected with the coronavirus.
The yard is now under quarantine and has been locked with a construction truck.
No one is allowed to leave the premises. Food is being delivered.
The government is now offering free coronavirus tests to the 3,300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the county council office has so far assumed that the infections did not spread beyond the yard.
'Conscience' confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
"My client has been cooperative", lawyer Quentin Chabert told the paper.
The defender added: "He is very sorry for the actions, the confession was a deliverance for him".
His mandate was "plagued by bitterness of conscience and greatly distressed by the extent of the destruction".
If convicted, the man faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros, according to the prosecutor's office.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged by fire last Saturday night.
The fire had broken out at three places far apart in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, now in custody, had been arrested just hours after the fire.
But he was released after a day.
The man is a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for closing the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came under the spotlight of investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the 50+1 rule be abolished.
"German football should at least discuss, set conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates complete facts", Grindel told the Sunday picture.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to become dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, it is not necessary to avoid the debate on whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors by associations that want to break into this phalanx".
He doubts, however, whether the German Football League is willing to allow majority shareholdings prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the Bundesliga economic location in a European single market", Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "attempts to ensure a more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only ultimately weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even a uniform distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
'FC Bayern has a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences between the first three clubs alone are therefore immense.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million", explained the 58-year-old.
Looking back, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this error and stabbed the press instead of talking to me about it", Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"It's been very busy with me, humanly".
The gift, worth about 11,000 euros, was given to him by a Ukrainian official.
"I have committed a breach of compliance, and it was right to draw the consequences", Grindel said.
"I have dealt with the ominous gift of movement completely transparently and unsuspectingly.
Many in the DFB knew about it".
He never "made a hole in the gift", the 58-year-old assured.
"It's naive to call it, but at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption".
"Black Lives Matter": Wounded and a Dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have been intensified by Donald Trump's deployment of federal police in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes between protesters and police took place in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville, 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, a person was shot dead while a protest train was crossing a crossroads.
Earlier, clashes erupted in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officials, used tear gas on Saturday night to force protesters out.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky, on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor's death be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who didn't even live there, and there were no drugs found.
When a member of a group calling itself the Black American Armed Alliance fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were floating in danger.
The police erected barricades because opposing protesters had formed a white militia.
The meeting of the two groups did not end.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and killed during a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they detained a suspect.
She has not yet given any further details on the circumstances of the incident.
According to The New York Times, Mayor Steve Adler said that he, like many in the city, was "disconcerted and dismayed" by what had happened.
In the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters clashed with police on Saturday.
They set fire to cars outside a juvenile prison, and the police planted grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assaulting a body.
In the city of Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters blocked windows, fired fireworks and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire was quickly put out again.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd of protesters on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital with injuries.
Also, a courthouse was broken into and a fire was set, police said.
Investigations have been launched.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: historical costumes are defying Corona
Although the great sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But even if the big party miles in the city centre were missing, the crowds and program highlights like the burning halls, Rakoczy ball or the festival, many of them were paying for the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we have managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair", says Kurds Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have taken it well.
In principle, we go back to the beginning of the Rakoczy Festival, when only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy Festival in Bath Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So is this time in the year of Corona.
The couple have been making themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watching the historic flannel and listening to live Cuban music at the gaming bench restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant too", says Konhäuser.
She misses the masses of people who don't belong to Rakoczy.
But you're missing the usual highlights of the programme, especially the burning of the halls on Friday night, the historic festival and the final fireworks on Sunday night.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year", she says.
Rakoczy riding tournament is to be held again
For the performers of the historic guests, the alternative programme meant some more work.
I'm talking about Christina Gold, who is a regular year's party and can be seen in the coach of the nursery café.
This year, she was out walking around town in costume on Saturdays and Sundays.
"It's more difficult, otherwise it's easier", she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were traveling in the park.
"We are very hopeful that the equestrian squad will be able to take place again next year", says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause, a Rakoczy equestrian tournament will be held again in 2021.
28 cases of coronavirus in Spanish second-league player Fuenlabrada
Spanish football double-league champion CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper into the crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid, despite the first cases of corona, flew to a game in the city of A Coruña on July 20, a deep blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one of whom was admitted to hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada, from the town of the same name, southwest of Madrid, has had a chance to make the playoffs so far.
Now even the threat of relegation to the B-Group of the Second League.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña on Monday was cancelled at the last minute, the prosecution is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering forcing the club's exit.
The players and other team members are in a hotel in quarantine.
"They have not received a fresh towel or gel until the sixth day of quarantine", wrote the sports newspaper "AS".
The pictures showed players hanging underwear and club clothes in their hotel rooms for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
Also, the bedding was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It was neither good nor good enough, AS wrote.
The club management, on the other hand, said that they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the allegation of deliberately endangering public health.
The rules of the Corona Association have not been violated, said Javier Tebas, son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Before the flight, there were four infected people until July 19, but they were all isolated and not travelling.
Just before the flight to A Coruña on Monday, all players and team members were tested again.
When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members tested positive for the coronavirus.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before the whistle, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must catch horses that are torn out by the steam box
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user reported two free-range horses on the bridge between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld estuary and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already between the Zubringer and the village of Dampfach.
After the officers gained the confidence of the horses just before the steam engine, they each let a rope carried by the police car ride down.
The European Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new framework for the European Parliament.
Time travel specialist Tony Martin is thinking about continuing his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Tony Martin, a seven-time world time trial champion, can imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I am currently working with the team on the framework conditions for how and in what form it could continue", the 35-year-old told the "Frankfurt General Sonntagzeitung".
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
He said the negotiations with his team also involved the number of racing days.
Or about other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He had once stood up after a fall and his first thought was, "Get back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little girl, I think, "What if?"
The cyclist admitted that there are certain aspects that are becoming increasingly difficult for him to deal with.
"But it was good to remember, based on the Corona era, what I have in cycling and how much fun I have in it".
The time trial specialist will return to the Tour de l'Ain (5-9 August).
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavarian streets over the weekend
In many places, the weather is nice and bikers are on the streets.
For at least three people, the bike tour ends deadly.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - Several, mostly young people died in accidents on the streets of Bavaria over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcycle rider was caught on Saturday near Schönthal (Cham County) by a car that hit the opposite track.
Why the car hit the counterclockwise direction was unclear at first.
In Upper Bavaria, a 22-year-old man collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his car on Saturday.
He was on his way up the mountain at Beilngries, according to police.
In a left-hand turn, he crashed into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe, he died at the scene.
Of the 12 occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man was slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in the upper-False bath Kötzting.
He had been lying on a road on Sunday night and was run over by a 42-year-old driver.
The police suspected the 18-year-old wanted to sleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau) a 57-year-old biker collided with a car on Saturday in a right-hand corner despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, leaving the other three people in the car unharmed.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavarian Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as underpass protection on guideboards and the reduction of dangerous curves.
"We have achieved a lot in recent years for the safety of motorcyclists", the letter said.
"The number of motorized two-wheeler deaths decreased by about 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac is testing Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - Soccer coach Niko Kovac will soon be seeing Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be staying at Hessen, the former Croatian club, on 1 August.
For the Bundesliga side, it is the first and only hardness test before the Europa League replay against FC Basel (6 August).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting will be held without spectators.
"We're very excited about this game.
It is always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends", Kovac explained.
The 48-year-old said that this was an interesting test for sports.
Before joining FC Bayern Munich, Kovac coached Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led them to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-profile opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again", said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian in the contest.
In March, the Frankfurters lost the semi-final match against Basel at their own stadium 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: County Court just past the lockdown
In Hof County, the number of known new coronavirus infections continued to rise over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person was cured and no longer included in this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.
And then there's a case in Hof.
This brings the yard to the critical mark of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 dead from monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people have been affected by severe flooding in Southeast Asia, particularly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
The heavy monsoon rains killed a total of 700 people.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people by boat.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Tank horns in the National Park are dying from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank horns died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly severe, which is why scientists attribute climate change to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New housing is empty
In the village of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built homes for 650 flood displaced people.
So far, few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also in Grenezn.
If you used to have a house, even if it was so small and like a hut, you often don't want to spend your life in a big block of flats.
Many homes are empty, but - the government wants them to be - they will soon be taken over by those who have lost their homes to the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new requirements could not be met, the Economy Ministry said in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"This would be not only irresponsible but also unfair", it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under the present conditions.
Argentina is therefore asking its private creditors to waive part of its claims of around US$66 billion (about 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country is once again threatened by the state.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Lastly, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
The Argentine Government, however, is holding on to its last offer and is not prepared to make any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent last year.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of about 10 percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to pay interest claims of US$503 million and had therefore slipped into a limited default.
Coming to work - not yet in private
"It's going super well" - this is the conclusion Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she would be taking over from Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden notary office.
Six weeks later, in early July, the law graduate took up the job, the normal day-to-day business already running on full-time tours.
"I have to get to the station privately", she explains, laughing in conversation with the Rottal advertiser.
The short lead time was not enough to move the centre of food from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, says the native Dingolfinger.
She is currently with her husband, who is a judge at the county court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave for a short period of time to provide for the two daughters (aged 3 1⁄2 and 11 1⁄2 years).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also had the opportunity to stay with her parents in Dingolfing for a while, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring countryside, the town of Eggenfelden has been a term for her for a long time.
During visits to the area with her family in recent months, she remarked: "Egggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased to have made the race for the vacancy in the selection process.
Her native Bavaria also plays a central role in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's career: after studying law in Passau, she completed her term of office and the second state examination in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notary public, including Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "nearly" completed her doctorate in labour law - she took up her first position as a notary public in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, and then moved to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken up representation in various notaries.
When the job in Eggenfelden was terminated by Lutz Feller's impending retirement, she felt that the time had come for her full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of her predecessor, who will be taking over the holiday representation at the notary's office, has taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely - and is about to give a compliment to the staff of the law firm: "It's going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift in the private food point.
In the case of nursery and nursery spaces, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if all goes well, she hopes to be able to do her hobby here soon, too, and to experience the most beautiful running tracks in the country.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will be less than 20 percent full at the start of the season in case of a fan return.
"Given the distance rules that must be complied with, we plan to have between 12,000 and 15,000 spectators as of now", Borussia Dortmund manager Carsten Cramer told the daily Mirror.
The stadium usually holds just over 81,000 spectators for Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the coronavirus pandemic last season, BVB lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that in addition to the normal seating capacity, some of the approximately 4000 seats in the hospitality sector can be reopened: "It is obviously a blow to the office if these revenues are completely cut off".
Given the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is now "advised to take a stable page length first".
"If many businesses are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-term employment in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited", Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing manager praised BVB professionals for their payroll waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, players know that their payroll waiver has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising to short-term work".
Small Miracles: Early Start in Life With a Few Hundred Grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his whole body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The Bub is one of about 400 early babies cared for annually at the Graz Children's Hospital.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, and a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight, weighing less than a kilogram at birth.
They're so small and so early that neither the lungs, nor the intestines, nor the muscles are fully trained.
Sometimes their skin is so delicate that they could damage an ECG's electrodes.
And they're so tiny, they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windows made specifically for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in the voice - "and like", Berndt Urlesberger whispers.
"Even if they're not as loud as big babies".
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theatre in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage was seen by the 9th grade of St. James's High School in Abtsgmund just before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen City Theatre presented the production "The Home Dress" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was delighted to see the classroom enriched.
Although in the end all parties agreed that direct encounters in the theatre and on stage would provide additional stimulation, theatre also shows the potential for contact with schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game", stressed director Winfried Tobias.
First round triggered: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
If TSV 1860 qualifies for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty potential opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal are confirmed.
The Lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualifying.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday night at the ARD sports show.
Because the coronavirus pandemic has left the field incomplete, the lottery has been used to draw the winners.
By voluntarily abandoning semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There the lions will either meet the Würzburg Kickers or the Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
If the top two Würzburg qualified for the final, Sixty would have qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against regional league Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be played between 11 and 14 September, thus one week before the start of the third league.
"Before the Wind": Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The movie legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died of natural causes in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, her spokeswoman confirmed to the German Press Agency.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern States' epic Gone with the Wind (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian theatre actor Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Hermia in Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers immediately signed her to a seven-year contract and brought her out on the side of Eroll Flynn.
She made eight movies with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar for her leading role in To Each His Own.
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mother's Heart".
Three years later, she won the award for best actress in William Wyler's The Heiress.
She was also recognized for her neurotic eccentricity in The Dark Mirror and The Snake Pit.
Daphne du Maurier proposed her for the lead role in the 1952 film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied for a Dead Body".
From her marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946-1953) came the son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had a daughter, Gisèle.
This marriage broke up too.
However, rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler misses final at the comeback
World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they beat their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21) in the semi-final.
Last time Thole/Wickler played was last September at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, their rivals Ehlers/Flügen beat the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in early September at Timmendorfer Beach: Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers secured the tickets.
Calbitz's exit from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a fig leaf from the FDP's point of view and does not change the party's character.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the top of the iceberg of radicals in the AfD", said FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser to the Berlin-based news agency dpa.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided by a majority in May, after a hearing in Stuttgart on Saturday.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg parliament.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from its party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have been excluded long ago", Strasser said.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party".
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not mean anything and does not change anything", he told the "World on Sunday".
"It's more about how many frantic supporters there are still in the middle of the AfD".
Blume expects the AfD to fall below 5% in future elections.
"The days of the AfD in parliament are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around Thuringia's AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection group classifies the straying as "certainly a right-wing extremist endeavor".
In May, the AfD's Federal Executive had expelled Kalbitz from the party.
He stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a former membership in the now banned far-right group Homattreue Deutsche Jugend (HDJ) and the Republicans when he joined the party.
Kalbitz denies being a member of the HDJ.
The chairman of the Left faction in the Brandenburg parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Court of Justice does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains an extreme right-wing party, with or without Calbitz".
The decision will not weaken the Federal Party or the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Mutiny troops is clear.
You want to avoid further observation by the Constitutional Protection and try to get under the radar", Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the ghosts that called it.
A vote on the proposal will not change anything", commented the SPD General Secretary in Brandenburg, Erik Stohn, on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD National Federation and the faction remained their rightful leader to this day".
The legal debate over Kalbitz's membership of the AfD will continue.
The latter announced on Saturday that he would now proceed in civil law against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver 21 percent more electricity
The wind farms in the German North Sea have supplied 11.51 terawatt-hours of electricity to the grid in the first six months of this year.
This is a 21 percent increase over the same period last year, Tennet, the Bayreuth network operator, said.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission of electricity through the German grid.
The wind farms in the Baltic Sea, which are not part of the Tennet grid, have saved an additional 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
The total wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea will therefore be 13,73 TWh, compared with well over 11,64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany, about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms will increase production capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due, in addition to the wind conditions, to higher generation capacities, as new wind farms have been connected in the last 12 months.
If the 1270 wind farms in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this purpose, according to Tennet, at 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore network connections", said Tim Meyerjürgens, Managing Director of Tennet.
In reality, wind farms cannot even reach their capacity at sea, but they can reach about 40 percent.
The record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatt of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatt of electricity, or three to four nuclear power plants.
This could provide electricity to nearly seven million households.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmund Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary party for the 130.
Birthday of the Gmunders Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold broke the usual framework after the Corona break.
Many more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the president of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band Defenders of the Universe on the southern Kornhausplatz.
The Sandtogether Association was involved in the north of the gallery.
Friday: Windberg Festival canceled due to Corona
The Windberg Festival won't be held this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We did not make this decision easy and, knowing how difficult it is for the parties involved, we hoped until the last minute", explained Mayor Uwe Rumberg (partisan).
"But ultimately, as organizers, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands had flooded into the camp and the camp, there would be no minimum distance, no hygiene regulations, no contact tracing, and no compliance with the current coronavirus regulations.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that there would have been little left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and supervisory effort would increase disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg was hoping for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressure Olympic champion Werth not to beat in the armbands
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider in the Austrian championship of dressage.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg won four starts this weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with the inaugural gold and Quantaz, she was also unbeaten in the Grand Prix Special and the short run on Sunday.
At the 15 year old Stute Weihegold, Werth made a strong showing against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Sunday in the special.
The German woman was also in Quantaz on Saturday in front of her 34-year-old student, Victoria Max-Theurer.
Worth's winning horse Quantaz is owned by Max Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is set to establish the 10-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first time ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all four major exams.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for 14-16 August.
More locks in Worms in the future
The University of Worms is still in the air: the DFS German Air Safety Foundation is setting up a professorship in Air Traffic Management.
A corresponding agreement between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
The faculty is the means by which the beginning of studies can be made possible not only in the summer but also in the winter semester.
This will enable twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, capacity is used equally in both the university and the DFS Air Traffic Safety Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and appointment of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students in the programme of Air Traffic Management are in the framework of their training in flight locks at the University of Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
The experience of the DFS has been very positive so far, and the students' performance is excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training is a major contributor to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
"In these times, economic support is not easy.
We expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
To continue to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel", says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman and Managing Director of the DFS at the time of signing the contract.
'For the DFS, the Foundation Professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide a broad, expert knowledge base for air traffic controllers in the long term.
We are therefore continuing to work well with the university while reinforcing our attractiveness as an employer".
Professor Dr Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University, also points out: "The Foundation Professorship is an important bridge between science and business.
With it we wish to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor's programme in Air Traffic Management.'
The German air traffic control authority's confidence in Worms University is both a motivation and a commitment to further develop its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
In the use of tomorrow's air traffic controls, the university can set special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first Foundation Professor for a dual programme of study.
Dr Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stresses: "Worms University is a unique place in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
The signing of the cooperation agreement today strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue pickup truck landing on the A45
The A45 motorway was completely blocked on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg for about 30 minutes, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford around 12:40 p.m. at the Alzenau-Middle exit straight into the corner and landed on the control panel.
The impact triggered the frontal airbags, causing the driver to suffer minor facial injuries and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were treated by the emergency medical technician and the patient was then flown to a hospital by helicopter.
But at the moment, the police assume there is no life-threatening risk.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of some EUR 2000 had to be towed.
Heil wants to look at other sectors after meat industry
The coronavirus crisis has brought to light again the conditions in parts of the meat industry.
The law is about to be tightened.
But are they righteous - and will they remain?
The German Federal Minister for Labour, Hubertus Heil (SPD), wants to review other sectors as well, following the strict rules on complaints in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry by industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary", Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Employers in Germany are already warning against restricting employment contracts in general.
After the massive outbreak of the coronavirus at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the federal cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ outside personnel for slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
The Commission has also proposed a new directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Member States.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the DPA: "Finger off from a general restriction on employment contracts and employee leave if you do not want to completely choke down the economy".
For example, for many sectors of the craft, construction and plant construction industries, works contracts are the essential basis for their value creation for the customer.
"The failings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My aim is not to ban employment contracts everywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts are meaningful.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a security system, it's a very normal contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on employment contracts and hire-only work in its sector unconstitutional.
It is not clear why in future the right to work should be different for the serving and packaging of cheese than for sausage, the New Osnabrücker Zeitung reports in an opinion on the draft law.
A ban would therefore increase the consumer price by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Many East European workers from contracting companies worked in the industry part-time 16 hours a day, according to the results of an audit by the NRW Labour Protection Authority.
They often didn't have a break.
Pay was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said that a relatively strict law had already entered into force in 2017 for the meat industry.
However, "tricky constructions" have been used to circumvent these.
"Now it needs to be thoroughly cleaned up".
The politician announced: "The Labour Law, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that do not only concern the meat sector - for example, higher labour protection checks or clear criteria for Community accommodation".
The draft law on meat production contains amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers' Rights in the Meat Industry and the Law on Protection of Workers' Rights.
The Commission has also proposed a new directive on the protection of the environment.
"I wish we could do even more controls in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal protection, everything possible, including animal transport", Nonnemacher told RBB's "Brandenburg Current" on Sunday.
But more controls also require more staff.
Three dead in a crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on a multi-family house in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, according to police.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were rescued injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district police station said.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, police said.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single or two-family home.
Details were not initially disclosed.
The evacuation of Frankfurt Opera House is peaceful
A week after the Frankfurt riots, the evacuation of the opera house was peacefully carried out on Sunday night.
Last time, dozens of people were still in the square, but left before the lockdown began at 1 a.m.
Police had been in operation since early evening with numerous officers, and a larger police force was in place throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, the opera house where the crawls were held a week ago was banned.
Police officers were being attacked with bottles from the crowd.
At least five officers were injured after police reports, several police vehicles damaged.
Saturday night was also quiet.
Car overturns: young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries at 1.25pm on Sunday.
She was taken to the Kassel hospital.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on the road to her hometown of Hume on State Route 83 when her car derailed and overturned several times for an unknown reason.
To save the victims, the fire department had to cut the roof off the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the rotor controller used a thermal imaging camera to search the adjacent cornfield.
The Warburg drone crew, which also uses thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered to search for people.
But the task force found no one among the high corn plants.
The seriously injured were taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further treatment.
Almost 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on the scene.
The federal road was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record-breaking Juventus Turin secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team of the five-time world champion made the 36th overall scudetto in the club's history with a 2-0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo hit the score 1-0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which entered without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, cannot be displaced from first place two days before the end of the Serie A season.
The Inter Milan table is seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless in the first half despite their optical superiority, then Ronaldo hit the last action after a free-kick.
A play by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo also played 2-0 against the now offensive guests, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67).
This ensured the shiny but decisive success.
The foul-fighting meter that was shot at the lathe in the 89th minute must have been the only one that Ronaldo himself had the right attitude to the goalkeeper's score.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically on top of the ball for 90 minutes.
The games are strange and the momentum changes very easily", said coach Maurizio Sarri after a 1:2 draw at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
"The mental exhaustion of his players is great", said the Juve coach.
The Turiners had not yet been able to perfect the championship because of the defeat.
The final reassuring lead at the top of the table was ultimately due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the 11 games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had only won five.
Whether Ronaldo will still be the king of scorers is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund striker Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals on his account after his three-pack at 5:1 (1:1) of the fourth-placed Lazio Rom at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The current record holder in Italy is the Juve pro Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football will have the next chance to win the title.
Juventus are in the Champions League Eight Final, but must compete 0-1 against Olympique Lyon on 7 August to reach the final in Lisbon.
In the next round of the knockout stage, either Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all the threats of penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to give gas to countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: in the past year and the first four months of this year, police have already registered more than 250 illegal motor races in the southwest.
Although there are no comparisons for previous years, the Razer are increasingly working the judicial authorities: in the prosecutors' offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were carried out in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were 252 and in the current year to the beginning of June there were 151.
The races were less organised events, as shown by the Ministry of the Interior's response to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously ran into each other or fled the police - this is also described as an illegal race.
The driving seat was mainly occupied by German men aged 18 to 60.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
In comparison, only a few cases are caught and also charged: According to the Ministry of Interior, since 2018, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 sentences have been served.
But there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before to the tragic accidents and trials of recent years and showed more frequent signs, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is particularly popular with racing drivers, and drivers often stop traffic to make room and use the freeway for a race.
Last August a dozen drivers were caught under teak near Kirchheim, three months earlier there were 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
The A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
The speed limit is used to try to brake the razors on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the geysers.
The most expensive and luxurious sports cars often have Swiss badges because drivers avoid the grass to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and racing in the neighboring country.
The SPD cannot limit the speed limit to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would be able to solve this problem on motorways", says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert for the SPD's Landtag faction.
"The barrier to razor would be much higher if you weren't legally allowed to travel 200 miles per hour and more".
Rivoir has a less-than-exciting view of education or image campaigns: "Those who go beyond all the rules in this way and risk not only their own lives but the lives of other road users are hardly reachable by reason".
ADAC calls for greater police intervention
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not satisfied with this: "We assume that the speed limits will not deter Raser", says Holger Bach, head of transport and environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and even stricter controls on the routes concerned.
The high-level force measurement often becomes more painful and serious: from January 2019 to April 2020, three people died in the races across the country, including two non-participants in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men reportedly won a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, hit a garden wall and lay on the side, killing the 18-year-old passenger.
21 more people have been injured in the races over the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "There is no need for legislative action to increase the penalties for illegal motor racing", the paper states.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from food
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a diner in Rohrdorf, County Calw, on Thursday, stealing drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley street around 3:40 a.m. and ran toward the diner.
There he noticed a man who was using the refrigerator with drinks and then leaving the meal through a previously locked front door.
The perpetrator fled to the meadows behind the food.
The burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area, police said.
The suspect is described as being about 5 feet 5 inches tall and about 5 feet 8 inches tall.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie sweater, black pants and bright shoes.
The police are taking on further witness evidence.
Ackermann sprints to victory in the final stage of the Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has won his second day of the 10th Sibiu Tour in the final stage.
The 26-year-old trainer from the Bora-hansgrohe team set out on the 109-kilometer section with a start and finish in Hermannstadt in mass sprint after winning a stage on Saturday.
It was season three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall standings, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger stood out.
The 26-year-old had decided to run the mountain time for himself in the morning and thus took the top of the standings.
Only 104 drivers had made it to the final stage that evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit during the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win", Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic", said the 26-year-old.
300 yards from the finish line, he just put on his sprint, and it worked perfectly.
According to the rules of the World UCI, all the participants and their companions were tested for corona six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and carers in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organizing team and the media.
Viewers at start and finish were not allowed.
The Directorate gave instructions for lay reanimation
Dusseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family home, a child (4) suddenly lay in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call came in just before 1:00.
"A leader's opponent immediately gave instructions for lay reanimation", a firefighter spokesman told BILD.
Soon after, the rescue forces arrived and took the necessary measures to revive the area.
The life-threatening floating child was transported to the hospital for resuscitation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
The police have routinely taken over the investigation into the accident.
Firefighter: "We're assuming a tragic accident in the apartment".
Nuremberg: Unauthorized tuning meetings - police intercept, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people attended a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to tighten their controls on such events.
A major tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Central Franc police, at about 10.30 p.m. the Nuremberg traffic police noticed an increase in traffic in the area of a large parking lot on Ingolstädterstraße.
Then the police conducted a number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently did the police announce their intention to take more action against so-called auto posers.
Illegal tuning meetings in Nuremberg: only a small part of the "scene"
Officials counted 700 vehicles and about 1,100 people, police said.
However, only a small proportion of those present in the 'autoposes' and the concert scene are attributed to this.
Apparently, most of the scene involved was a police appeal.
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission's comments on the measures in question are not sufficient to justify the imposition of measures.
In addition, the majority of those present complied with the current infection protection rules, in particular the minimum distance and wearing of mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on the spot were completed by 1:00 a.m.
In total, officials found that 10 vehicles had undergone such structural changes that the operating licence had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be insured.
No car racing
There was no illegal car race.
"The Central Franks Police Bureau will continue to monitor the situation and will continue to implement enhanced control measures, including in connection with the rise of shoelaces", it said.
News5 spoke to Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They have all the beautiful rims, which we must not scratch", Schrödinger said.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to cause damage.
"The young people should get their cars back safely".
Employment Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-term employment
Berlin - The Federal Labour Agency (BA) has said it is investigating about 900 cases of suspected abuse of short-term wages.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-term employment", said Daniel Terzenbach, the executive director of the business, to the Frankfurt Allgemeine Zeitung.
When the coronavirus crisis began, many companies suddenly asked for short-term jobs, BA had to react quickly.
The test usually takes up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time at our disposal in this hot period.
We will look at the final accounts in the more detailed manner.
I'm sure there'll be more to come.
We're not naive and we're long-breathed".
The report also highlights the importance of the right to freedom of expression.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible fall insolvency wave.
"Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than last year?
The estimates are mixed, but we are arming ourselves for the case and are already training our employees in the labour agencies to process insolvency applications".
The figures are still not visible, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, some 40 young people were having a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 8.48pm by the police officers of the Prussian Castles and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the Foundation said at PNN's request.
The youngsters would have left the park.
On Saturday night, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by police officers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said Sunday.
There are illegal parties in the parks again and again
In the parks of the Foundation, there are gatherings that do not comply with the Covid-19 rules of distance and hygiene.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona order, the parks will be closed at dusk.
Camping on the meadows is prohibited under the parking regulations, there are few exceptions.
The foundation has long complained that visitors are leaving more and more garbage and destroying protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the rabbit hut in Neukölln district, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was canceled by the police.
Austria: Mass testing after coronavirus outbreak in tourist town
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular tourist town of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases rose to 48, as reported by the provincial authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were still out tonight.
Many of the infected young trainees are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has also tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday evening.
The curfew was set at 11:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
I'm also told that some guests left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections were made public.
The head of the district, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the trainees who had been celebrating in several places and could have been infected there on Saturday.
"We all liked doing this in our youth", he told the radio station Ö1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from 15 July were contacted.
The outbreak brings back memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a centre of the spread of the coronavirus across Europe during the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main areas of focus for new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for the Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record holder Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year away.
The Red Devils secured third place in the Premier League on the final day of the season with a 2-0 win over direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes must now settle for the Europa League, because Chelsea were still passing and qualified for the King's class as the fourth.
Aston Villa were able to cheer in the fight against the relegation.
Manchester United took the lead with a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71 minutes).
After a red card for Leicester City in the post-season, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) reached the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League Eight Final against FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"It means a lot to me", said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton also benefited Tottenham Hotspur, who went on to beat Wolves at Crystal Palace in a 1-1 draw and start sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United for the class maintenance.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84) immediately resembled Andrej Jarmolenko (85).
But the 1:1 (0:0) was enough because Watford lost to Arsenal 2:3 (1:3).
The club that shelved three coaches this season is dropping after five years in the Premier League.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn't save themselves by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, there was one point missing.
Liverpool, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win over Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
The English football team narrowly missed out on the points record.
The best score is held by Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle's lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38), Divock Origi (59) and Sadio Mané (89) drew the match for Liverpool on Sunday.
"It was an extraordinary season for this wonderful club", said goalkeeper van Dijk after the game, "which should motivate us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard".
The Premier League boss should be happy with the result.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been suspended from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, there was even discussion of an early cancellation or a neutral grounding of the remaining games.
However, the season was finally completed without any special events - but as in Germany, without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrest and violence at demonstrations against Netanyahu
Protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are getting fiercer.
There were violent clashes at night.
Israeli police violently attacked participants in a demonstration against the right-wing conservative head of government, Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem on Sunday night.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Among other things, the police used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
In total, according to media reports, about 6,000 people gathered near Netanyahu's office on Saturday night.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters played drums, blew horns, and called for Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a local demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news websiteynet reported.
People also demonstrated in many other places in Israel, including outside the head of government's private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv, according to police, on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on protesters on the side of the road from a driving car.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protestor in the south of the country.
The protester had suffered a slight neck injury.
There have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv recently.
The demonstrations accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Last year, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
He is being treated for premature relief and lack of preparation for a second wave of corona.
The corona crisis has caused a severe blow to the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent last year.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident at the wheel (NRW) - Transporter powered on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - A car accident on the B58 near Ahlen on Saturday afternoon claimed nine minor injuries.
A woman was driving with her two children (3, 5) toward Beckum.
Police: "Maybe she had suddenly brake because she wanted to turn".
The driver of a Mercedes van that was behind her must have seen it too late.
He crashed into the back of the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea closes down border town after suspected coronavirus
North Korea has so far seen its own measures to combat the coronavirus as a "brilliant success".
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspicious case.
Because of the first official coronavirus suspect in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a major city out of fear of disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological measures taken in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been trapped in the country", state media reported.
The region around the border town of Kaesong was declared a state of emergency.
The Communist leadership has issued the highest level of alert.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the country of exclusion.
North Korea has so far reported no infection and described its defences as a "clear success".
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms were reportedly found in a "outlaw" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person went to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
The South Korean authorities initially did not confirm the crossing of the four-kilometer-wide and largely mined military buffer zone.
However, the South Korean military has admitted that the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea is high, according to reports by the Yonhap national news agency.
There were investigations into some of these people.
North Korea has called an emergency meeting of the Workers' Party Politburo chaired by Kim Jong Un on Saturday over the suspected incident.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
As a precautionary measure, Kim ordered on Friday to "block Kaesong completely and isolate every district and region from others", it added.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had contact with her were quarantined.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the 'outbreak' and the conduct of the military unit responsible and, if necessary, to impose severe penalties.
It is estimated that there are about 300,000 people living in Kaesong.
Tensions ahead of the Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still under discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the building plan for the large-scale urban development project East", the city press release for the next municipal meeting on Tuesday 28 July at 16.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim says more casually.
The upgrading of the eastern city is, however, controversial until the end.
The majority of the votes are few, and even in the individual committees, depending on their presence, are very negative.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT) that the project developed from the citizenship and then by the administration and the municipality council to not let it fail after almost ten years of preparation now, project opponent Reinhard Klein criticized as "outside parliamentary opposition", "unconscious", "speculation", "deprecation" and "conscious false statements".
"Everybody thinks they know better", said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the Treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit is cheaper for the city, the Technical Council building is being renovated for 8,5 million euros, contrary to the city administration's claims of subsidies, which Klein believes exist.
The city will develop quite differently than the city council and business proponents predict.
To build the City by its own power and not by an investor: that was his plan B. One day after the election, the FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, which also opposes the project, proposed an alternative concept.
It also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council, the keeping of the Schloßberg open, the rental of the former hall for administrative space and a smaller urban redevelopment, ideally with local operators.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
The Council will vote on the noise plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Alzheimer's population from health noise caused by road traffic, including frequent time reductions.
In a press release, the local German transport club welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the city's political leaders are not innocent that this has to happen because they have only contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting bus services at thin speeds and by not making much of a commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The City Council also voted to approve the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The Commission has also proposed that the Member States should be able to adopt a new policy on the environment and the environment.
Citizens are welcome, but they must take the coronavirus precautions.
Tim Zimmermann is starting the new season with a lot of delay.
With almost half a year's delay, Tim Zimmermann will kick off his debut season in the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the Supercar League could start its regular operations, the first test runs were now underway.
For Zimmermann, it was primarily about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from taking his first tour of duty in Grasser Racing's new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old long-armed man turned his first laps on the Audi ring and got used to his debut in the GT3.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season", Zimmermann says.
"For example, with the ABS, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun".
Zimmermann also enjoyed himself with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite only 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Dutchman was able to help his new team-mate in many ways.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges", Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand each other very well and we have made tremendous progress at the hearing ring from session to session".
It is here - at the Lausitzring - that the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From July 31st, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lausitz.
But Timberman, who is one of 15 serial losers, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the track very little", says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafner Racing Association Graf Zeppelin.
"The listening ring has many quick passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast carpenter is, it'll be clear in two weeks.
"The teams play a little poker at the tests, of course", he says.
"But in the end, we're very happy and looking forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
Seven races are scheduled for early November.
The current situation is that no spectators will be allowed, but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take the GT wheel at the Nürburgring.
British transport minister of quarantine decision caught cold
The decision by the British government to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister by surprise, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
The UK government has also been able to provide a number of information on the situation in the UK and the UK.
The new rules will go into effect today, Sunday, so Shapps will also be quarantined after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are just on holiday on the final day, only from Saturday 1 August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain is still considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria, where quarantine is not required.
"A number of ministers must have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine for holidaymakers in Spain", commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the coronavirus emergency in Spain and the end of the strict curfew, the infection rate in the country is rising again.
Virologists blame the nightlife for the new outbreak.
Spain is one of the most beloved holiday destinations in Britain.
The British Government is currently advising against non-essential travel to mainland Spain, excluding the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 new coronavirus infections and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the occasion of the Navy Day that his country will equip its warships with the latest hypersonic weapons.
With these unique weapons in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian Navy would be expanded, Putin said at the Central Marine Parade in St. Petersburg on Sunday.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax of successful tests of the Zircon hypersonic missile, built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They're considered the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is being built
The nuclear-powered submarine torpedo Poseidon was also being built.
The planned seeding drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who also flew a military boat, said that this year alone 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual naval associations of the world's largest country.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
In many other Russian coastal areas, the Navy began the day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside the ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated its strength at a gun show at the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
They fired ammunition there too.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help from Corona is difficult
Washington - The first hurricane of this year's Atlantic season has made landfall in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rainfall now threatened parts of the U.S., the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Agency NOAA reported on Sunday night (local time).
Governor Greg Abbott has declared a state of emergency for numerous counties.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas is making it harder for the relief workers to work, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuated persons called to alert
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge", Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the Texas hurricane, he added: "This challenge is complex and will be compounded when you consider that it is sweeping through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state".
According to Johns Hopkins University, the coronavirus pandemic has killed about 5,000 people in Texas alone.
Abbott called for caution for people who had to leave their homes.
They should not disregard practices "to which we are accustomed", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It's important that everyone keep their distance.
Hence, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
And we're also supposed to be testing for corona in emergency shelters.
Damage was initially only reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn
With winds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, the "Hanna" was hit by land on Padre Island, just off the coast of Texas, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to a hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm warning was issued and later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a slowdown as Hanna moves further inland and into northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" is moving to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was heading toward Hawaii on Sunday night at wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
However, the Hurricane Center expected it to weaken further.
The forecast is that it will be near the largest Hawaiian islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane's threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, following a May forecast.
The Authority had stated that up to 10 hurricanes were expected to occur between June and the end of November, and that up to six very strong hurricanes could develop.
On average, there are six hurricanes a year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperatures in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the likelihood of a normal season is only 30 percent, compared with an under-average season of even just 10 percent, it said at the time.
US President Donald Trump tweeted that his government is closely monitoring the storms and is in touch with the affected states.
Four goals were scored: video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo Filip Djuricic were knocked out in two straight sets
Naples - Scored four goals, conceded four: Sassuolo Calcio had a dark night at 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian football League Serie A - and was really angry at the referee's video assistant.
"A festival of unpaid goals for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR been so tough against a team", commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
The host Naples had taken the lead by a goal from outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The video assistant referee (VAR) withdrew the hit because of a remote position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic threw the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of the strikers Francesco Caputo (50) and Domenico Berardi (61) were also withdrawn by the refereeing team, according to the VAR.
In the postseason, Allan perfected the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the street and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records", writes the "Gazzetta dello Sport".
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard is injured
Munich (dpa) - The start of the hot Champions League preparation phase began for double-winning Bayern with a setback.
After a short vacation and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well", must consider how to rebuild his successful defense after the injury to World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third-most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left foot and is threatening to miss crucial royalty matches.
In Munich's muddy weather, the defender broke off a training game and was driven off the field with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted tribal player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the semifinal replay against Chelsea on 8 August is likely to be difficult, as the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament, which starts in Lisbon on 12 August.
But the Bavarians won't let the misfortune of Sunday's training stop them.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on their way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his victorious title collectors in the ideally 28 days leading up to the King Class final on August 23.
"We did our homework with the championship and the cup.
Now it is time to create the special", said Flick.
But until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and before that with a training camp in the Algarve, the first time is the eighth-final obligation against FC Chelsea.
After the 3-0 in the penalty shootout before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not become Bayern's nightmare again like they did in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012.
"We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game", Flick demanded.
A test of fitness is set for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had his stars, who had been on holiday for 13 days after the Double, sworn to a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players to the Sabine Street, including the new players for the Edel-Kopaf Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time since his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy has been as good as any newcomer", Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. can no longer just train, Flick talked about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength training is now being offered to the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game as opposed to the flick ensemble.
After that, the Munich team could face FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi in the quarter-finals, while in the semi-finals, Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are potential opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy", stressed the head coach, who can count on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
World Cup goalkeeper Klose and Flick know of so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-on-100 match.
Flick praised the fact that working with his current team was "a pleasure".
The "focus on winning" is an impressive feature of his team.
The nine-team tournament on Sunday was also ambitious.
All the performers were present, including Thiago, who wanted to leave the country, and David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal class season is not guaranteed.
Formula One needs a special rule to crown its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All the American races have been canceled.
The race calendar is becoming more concrete
The current Formula One racing calendar is still taking shape.
Three more races were added to the ten Grands Prix confirmed so far during the week.
The Nürburgring in Germany and Portimão in Portugal will be run in October.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points at the Italian traditional track in Imola.
The 2020 race calendar thus includes 13 races as of now.
"We are pleased to continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season", said Formula One boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the King's class of motorsport are scheduled to be held during this exceptional season.
Formula One wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
In the run-up to the officially scheduled Bahrain and Abu Dhabi races in December, media reports suggest that there could be further performances in Vietnam and Malaysia in late November.
The rules require racing on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require racing on at least three continents to be awarded for the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are to be raced, there should be a world champion.
The FIA is seeking to award the titles under a special rule, citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled shortly due to the looming coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not a matter.
In addition, Formula One will not be hosted in America this year.
Cancellation faced criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense coronavirus situation, the races will not be held in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being with them again next season", Carey explained.
The cancellation of the America's Cup was criticized in Brazil, especially: "The cancellation came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it", said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the São Paulo Grand Prix.
In the case of the São Paulo region, infection rates are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to race in Brazil would not justify cancellation.
The Commission has already decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the safety of the vessel is maintained.
Greta Thunberg: Bad looks at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's famous Latenacht show via video chat and revealed in the interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US late-night show via video chat.
Among other things, she spoke of her struggle against the powerful in the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention for her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known late-night show, she talks about her plans for the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on your show Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world's powers.
"There are some things that have surprised me", she said.
"How far people go to divert attention away from the climate crisis", she shook.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are taking to the streets", she said.
She finds it "fun" when heads of state and leading politicians mock her on social media or even try to silence her, showing her the reactions "because they have no other answer".
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached by a famous scene in which she took a bitter look at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip produced a GIF, an animated image, which eventually became one of the most used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the American president at that moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she answered briefly and without saying anything: "To be honest, I don't think there's any further explanation".
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the striking response and disappeared briefly laughing.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Immobile with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for the European Golden Shoe on par with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski.
Former Dortmund manager Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming the goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional took three hits in Lazio Roma's 5:1 (1:1) win over Hellas Verona, including two converted eleven metres in the second half.
The 30-year-old has now 34 goals in two games before the end of the season - the same number as Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich in the last Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a fast climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply down and then slowly up again.
Now, the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug addict, cult fan: the co-founder of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, with another statement to be announced in the coming days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
Drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green formed the now legendary band in London in 1967, and his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" remains unforgettable to this day.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
There was a dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the profits to the group for charity.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Psychological problems also played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was in psychiatric care.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street for a while, worked as a graveyard gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the London Borough of Bethnal Green.
From a young age, he was enthusiastic about American blues musicians like B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar strings.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to take the stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
Shortly after, he was hired by the Bluesbreakers to replace his idol Eric Clapton.
In the midst of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with fellow Bluesbreakers Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
Green's song "Albatross" became the group's first number one hit in the winter of 1968-69, catapulting them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green did not reinforce the media rumor, his experiments with the drug LSD became more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that ever happened to me in my life was the drugs - the best thing was to land a No. 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising cult following in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac was swimming without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
Her 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he started again in 1996 with a group of friends.
The British Daily Telegraph was reporting that a rock star had returned to earth.
Drugs-free, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
To music experts, he was a blues legend in his lifetime - and with his gentle sound, one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
