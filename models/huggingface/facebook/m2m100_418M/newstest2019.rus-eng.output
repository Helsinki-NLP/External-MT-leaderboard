The number of preparing to send to the Donbass newborns from Ukraine
The official representative of the People's militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrei Morocco said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send to Donbass at least 3,000 new workers.
According to him, in this way, Kiev plans "even somehow to comply the units."
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the armies of Ukraine, the mass dismissals led to the low complexity of the units,” Morocco said, citing RIA Novosti.
He also not excluded that the real numbers called to the army of the Ukrainians could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017 Kiev began the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Operation of the United Forces (OOS).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to an increase in the role of Ukrainian forces in settling the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zaharchenko.
The DNR authorities qualified what happened as a terrorist attack.
During the criminal investigation several people involved in the explosion were arrested.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the dissolution was organized by Ukrainian intelligence services.

British Foreign Affairs Head compares EU to Soviet Union and prison
Britain's Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union with the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states.
With this statement the diplomat spoke at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the faith in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from the community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from the prison,” the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only aggravate the crisis, notes "Gazeta.ru".
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said the Brexit talks went into a fool.
It commented on the results of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was adopted in 2016 on the basis of a referendum.
The UK's departure is expected to take place by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The issue on the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complain about failure in the new version
iPhone users complained about problems with the Telegram messenger after the update released on September 28.
The phone number of the user can be found by his user.
The complaints relate to gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, after the update, the app shows a white screen or is immediately closed.
The messenger responded to failure.

In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the terrorist suspects when a relevant court decision is made.
The audience of Telegram after blocking in the Russian Federation decreased by 1.2 million

Nico calls for “Moscow language to be an Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of their native language, Larisa Nicoy, called for the "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow language" to be drawn out of Ukraine.
To do this, she offers the Ukrainian product – “cultural wave, cultural pressure”.
With his considerations about the "objectivity of the eradication of the Russian language in Ukraine" Nicoy shared with the Ukrainian edition "Observator".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now preparing - it is even already and continues to develop further.
With time, the Ukrainians will "heal" from this "Moscow language," she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she says, earlier on television and radio was widely used Russian language, but in public space it was almost not left.
At the same time, according to Nietzsche, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities that prohibit the use of the Russian language, according to her, are only "an extension of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level."
Earlier, Nico shared the experience ofining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in the children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court of the Watsons bookstores network, one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Without achieving his own, Nico threw the girl withgiveness.
The use of Russian words by the Ukrainians it calls "language schizophrenia", calling the Ukrainians to give up the Russian letters even in writing names.
Recently, Nicoy said the name "Rus" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The writer's anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and went away, knocking the door.
In the break they held a male conversation, and it brought its fruits.
Defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.
“Dennis, what did you think you succeed in winning?”
“I think we wanted to win more,” says Kulakov’s official website of Ural.
"There was such a difficult game, a serious men's conversation was held in the break, and it brought its fruits: they hit two balls and didn't miss.
"You missed a few matches due to the injury you got in the beginning of the month.
“How did you feel today?”
“If you’ve suffered 90 minutes, it’s okay.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe, at the end, a little bit of strength to make nothing happen.
And so, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashnev brought me to this game, which is a great thanks!
“What do you say about the atmosphere in the team?”
“It’s not a secret for anyone that after the victory and recovery is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
We had a white strip, though it was black at first.
We must continue in the same spirit and rejoice the fans.”
“You’re tired of playing for the time you didn’t go out on the field?”
“There’s such, I’m a bit tired, because really, the unpleasant situation has come out.
But I repeat again, thank the physiotherapist and the doctors for putting on their feet.
The most important thing is that we have won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

According to the source, the head of Serbia said that, speaking of the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support for the example of Syria.
Alexander Vučić said he does not want to allow a scenario in which any major military collisions may occur on the territory of the state.
The president of the country has promised to make the most effort to preserve the peace, the newspaper reports.
According to the information of the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the next Tuesday, October 2, according to Lenta.ru.
A day earlier it became known that the Serbian president brought the army of the state into full battle preparation due to the situation with Kosovo.
It is about the events last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory that lies to the lake that supplies water to the hydroelectric power plant Gazivode.
It is noted that the GES is located on the territory of Kosovo, but it applies to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia 10 years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the topic of Russia in the negative key was practically absent
The head of the Committee of the Federation Council on International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a reversal in the perception of the Russian Federation as an inseparable participant in the resolution of global global problems.
"The unique part of the current 73th session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, to which we have been almost accustomed in recent years regarding Russia, was now more narrow," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in the previous years the Russian Federation was occasionally described as one of the three main threats to mankind, then along with the Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this line, in any case, in the exposure of a group of Western countries, which on this account was expressed quite unanimously.
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, “the topic of Russia in the negative key was practically absent.”
“If I carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I am now not taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the chorus was not quite accurate,” the politician said, noting that Russia “is no longer a wall that is trained by a tennis ball.”
The head of the profile committee of the Soviet Union does not exclude that this indicates some trend that, in his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [the UN General Assembly], although in full this trend is likely to appear in a year, in two, three."
“I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be reversible,” Kosachev said, explaining that “there are too many examples of how with the connection of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs.”
As an example he brought the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“So far, unfortunately, it’s not Ukraine, but I don’t doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be sought over time,” he added.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is “a adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not simply possible – an inseparable participant in solving global problems of modernity.”
“I don’t want to be wrong, but I have the feeling that we’re going somewhere through a point where movement will no longer be a move backward, it will be a move forward,” he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context Kosachev called “the demand for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop.”
"I was present at many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if another year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in large scale, no one was interested, then now the situation is different," the chairman of the Soviet committee said.
According to him, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is represented with the West, has no answers to questions about how to solve global problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration.”
“And here the request for the Russian vision becomes more and more obvious,” Kosachev expressed confidence, emphasizing that he considers in this sense “the present session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia.”

Damascus hopes that it will not have to use military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, said Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic, Valid Muallem.
He said that Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of the militants of the prohibited organization Jebhat al-Nusra in Russia from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also emphasized that Damascus will have to recour to a military solution to the issue of territories east of Euphrates in case the Kurds are seeking separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, negotiations with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.

Earlier it was that the 37-year-old defendant was negotiating the transition to the Moscow "Spartak".
As RT reports with reference to Mirror, former captain of England, John Terry, headed the Chelsea youth team.
According to the source, a well-known player, who has long been a part of the London club, will lead the team not over the age of 23.

According to her, these days under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris is taking place an action, the participants of which announced a hungry protest with the demand to release the prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural actors, among them are people who know you well, hungry, supporting Oleg Senzov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no one international meeting, no one negotiations, no one interview, wherever the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authority, we all, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one requirement - the liberation of Oleg, the liberation of Roman, the liberation of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those children who are illegally held on the occupied territories of the Donbass and Crimea.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will strengthen every Ukrainian, making us “bader, harder in defending the national interests of Ukraine, in defending every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil.”
The Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with spying on the main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years of colony of a strict regime, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as lawful.
Russian prisoners satisfied the last request of the Ukrainian before his staging into the colony.

Wachtang Kikabidze on the fight against cancer
Now many artists tell about how they managed to deal with oncology.
The disease, unfortunately, doesn’t save anyone, and the story of popular people about victories over cancer gives hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wachtang Kikabidze admitted that he lived only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago he was given a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
“I was as if I was shot down on my neck.
I fell.
I lost orientation.
put in the hospital.
There he couldn’t hold the bed, he couldn’t stand, he fell all the time.
They started to do tests, it turned out bad things, the artery does not pass the blood.
They were brought to Moscow, there they were told that I had a large purulent cyst in my head, they were urgently operated.
And during the operation the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst," Kikabidze said in the program "One Time".
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the inhabitants of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to Kumir at the threshold of his house.
But the actress's wife did not allow the actress to be buried alive, she faithfully believed that she could cope with the disease and for more than a year did not leave the bed of her beloved spouse.

The cause was “a attempt to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.”
In addition, the head of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the neighboring countries has been distorted in "direct threats of invasion of Ukraine" and "supporting separatist moods in Ukraine", as well as in the participation "in the organization of provocation aimed at the mass violation by citizens of Ukraine of the legislation of Ukraine".
It is noted that before Sijarto in the "Clean" agreed the Deputy of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Paul and the Deputy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchs) Onufry.
The reason was their opposition to the receipt of Thomas by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Carpathian Republic, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign rights of Ukraine.

Member of the State Duma calls on to tell students about the harm of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teenagers to masturbate is provoked by the harmful information they find on the internet.
Fighting this is on the level of educational institutions and family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Talk Moscow":
In the framework of the general sexual education of children, this should be done, explaining the harm, because there is a risk determined to the sexual health of the child, both the boy and the girl.
The problem is objective, it is that the child’s maturity occurs early enough, and there are big knives between their sexual maturity and the ability to officially enter intergender contacts.
Onyschenko believes that the solution of the problem is interfered with the “haness”, the silence of the “problem of sexual age” and the lack of culture of adequate education of children.

ADG became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" beat another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel's ratings fall.
According to all, the inhabitants of Germany began to be seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which made the country a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most clearly about this is stated by recent sociocrises, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling block Merkel and Zeehopher are weakening.
This week, ADG hit another record, rising to the second line in the ranking of popular sympathy.
Right conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to overcome social-democrats with about 16 percent.
The gap to one percentage point can be recorded as a statistical error, but it cannot be noted the fact that the ADG created in 2013 from a small group of euroskeptics managed to become a serious political force.
The leadership in the general account for now continues to hold the ruling block of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - in April, Angela Merkel's support was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who leads the German government for the fourth time in a row, is also decreasing.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that the social-democrats followed the “green” (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
The evolution of “alternatives”
The "Alternative for Germany" party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the "Alternative Choice 2013" group, which included members of the Christian-Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but in the first instance it only dealt with economic issues, including the eurozone and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsorship” of the weak EU economies, not excluding the possibility of a return to the German mark and a complete withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
In the background of the deepening of the immigration crisis, the political platform of the ADG has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017 ADG was able to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 parliamentary seats (from 709).
Two “Alternative for Germany” representatives have received seats in the European Parliament.
Video with a journalist calling Ukrainian citizens “a nation of the Bolgarians”
The leader of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov in direct broadcast acknowledged he believes his fellow citizens "a nation of the Bolgarians".
They believe in TV and read little.
As Drosdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been influenced by the culture of reading and acceptance of texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drodov's words, accusing him of the absence of patriotism and thirst.
As previously, the State Committee on Television and Radio Independent began fighting literature, which contains the smallest clues to criticism of the Kiev authorities, prohibiting the import of up to 201 editions.

Canadians Created a Car for the Apocalypse - The Driving Magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is already receiving applications for its new armor.
Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse money is made not only by producers of video games, cinema and book publishers.
Now, the new niche is also achieved by the automotive companies.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its armor of the Apocalypse Senator APC.
In a time free of fantasy, the engineers of this company are creating armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed to accommodate 12 passengers who are uncomfortable but fully secure in a fully charged armor capsule.
This bunker, otherwise the design will not be named, as its reservation level meets the B7 standard, set on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its armor, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from submersions by grenades and anti-passenger mines.
Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order for passengers not to be damaged even by the explosive wave from the missile broken next to the car, the car salon is equipped with special amortizing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and firewall system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a system of circular viewing cameras with the function of night vision, as well as a viewing armed tower on the roof.
There is no weapons in the car.
The Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
To prevent the weight of the armored vehicle from affecting its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-power durable turbodiesel engine of 6.7 liters, all power transferred to four wheels of the armored vehicle through a 6-step automatic transmission box.
There is no chance to lock the Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC.
The armor of the Roshel Senator APC apocalypse can be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will take place in October.
The term of death of the universe
The universe remains about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equivalent to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is published in the library of electronic printing arXiv.org and is aimed at publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports.
These findings were made by observing the Subaru telescope using a HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera for about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, the scientists, working within the standard cosmological model LCDM (L Cold Dark Matter), estimated the pace of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release from the Subaru Observatory, observations enabled to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data recording of the European space telescope Planck clarified the limits imposed on the parameters of the LCDM.
In July, scientists imagined a possible destruction of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world will cease its existence in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Break.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The possibility to know the opinion of the people about the pension reform is delayed for an indefinite period
In Moscow on Saturday, a meeting of the general federal initiative group of the referendum against the rise of the retirement age was held.
There were representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different formulations of questions (all of them were registered by the Central Assembly with five formulations).
They decided to contact the CIC with a request for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Do you say that the age established by the legislation on pension insurance as of 1 July 2018 is not increased, by which the citizens of Russia receive the right to appoint pension by age?"
This formulation was registered by the Vladivostok subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally legal.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of "Justice Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the KPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups — from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg — joined them.
Earlier, Sviridov told the "Vedomosts" that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, the head of the Vlagod subgroup (this formulation was supported by another 15 subgroup), told the "Vedomosti" that she didn't receive the invitation and didn't plan to come: "We didn't understand who was a friend and who was an enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbin's errors fell as from the corner of abundance
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the arbitrator Yevgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and discussed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you evaluate the judgment of Eugene Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
“I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his inappropriation to the judgment of the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the efforts in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dinamo", nor Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow to affect in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private missions of brutal approaches fell as from the corner of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the Eder railway, the defendant "Ahmata" Rodolfo falls with his hands in his penalty square.
It is eight meters from the door, but Turbin does not put the penalty.
What do you think of the episode with Idov, who was at the 82nd minute when the ball appeared to be in his hand?
I think there was a deliberate game with the hand of the defendant in his penalty field.
Turbin was close to the moment, well seeing this episode and his first assistant right.
This moment was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, the three fell asleep, and the penalty was not appointed.
Therefore, the account in the match was distorted, and sports justice was corrected.
This was the same case when the judgment by concepts exhausted and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not decide to remove the guest defendant Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krychovyk, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstrately praised him.
What do you think about this episode?
Did we have to show the second “ginger”?
At this point Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite in the case.
The second would be irrational.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of judgment that some teams are penalized for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
Consider what to understand under double standards.
There was penalty.
He did not give him.
Therefore, the arbitrator does not give the second penalty to the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of the double standards is that the judge looks who plays.
Here "Lokomotiv" played on Saturday and "Ahmat" has serious claims to Turbin's work because the team was damaged.
Matt Damon played the accused of rape judge Kavano at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first release of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavano on hearing in the Senate on accusation of rape.
The candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court previously attracted attention by his emotional and detailed stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
So, Kavano repeatedly acknowledged in his love for beer, but said he had never drunk until his memories.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself by the accusation of rape, Kavano stated that in those years he was a virgin.
Damon also defeated these moments.
I just did that I drank a lot and didn’t think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, the most drunk virgin ever seen.
Everyone knows this,” said the judge in Matt Damon’s performance.
Previously, Kavano was elected the Supreme Judge of the United States.
Barbara Stresand Discovered Strange Behavior in Her Cloned Dogs
American singer Barbara Straysand said her dead dog clones behave completely differently than the original pet.
“They are not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Straysand ordered two clones to her 14-year-old dog of the cat-de-tullear breed named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was that the Chihuahua breed dogs by Miracle Milly, who was called the world’s smallest dog, cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are dealing with the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The U.S. thought about the maritime blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
In the U.S. they can start the maritime blockade of Russia to gain advantage on the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities have so harshly struggled for success on the global market of hydrocarbons that they are ready to resort to the maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s leading energy suppliers.
The possibility of the maritime blockade was told by U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to the world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior does not perform police, but civil functions, including the implementation of natural resources policy.
Therefore, the statement of Zinke came quite within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Navy, they control the maritime routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be associated with Washington’s desire to block Russian supplies to the world’s energy market.
Zinke reminded that Russia still receives a lion share of its revenue from the supply to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as in Eastern Europe was the main motivation for the activation of Moscow in this region.
The minister said the United States is still looking forward to ensuring itself the leadership in the world’s energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
For this, Washington will have to stretch Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke says.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia
There was a club in Russia that I followed.
Former captain of Chelsea and England team John Terry - about why he visited the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
“I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I’ve been watching it very recently and I’ve been interested to see it from the side.
I can’t say that I’m a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy to Sparta and again I want to apologize for the decision I made,” Terry said.
"Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" was on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red and white on October 7 will play with "Enisée", and Valeria Carpina's supporters will receive "Orenburg" a day earlier.
A cowboy was delivered to a lombard for a disguise.
When a man in the LBC Boutique and Loan lombard located in Somerville, Massachusetts, brought a scripture, a lombard worker offered only $50 for an old and unrepresentative tool.
But the experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected it was an old and expensive tool, and asked for consultation to an expert.
It was found that the scraper was manufactured in 1759 by the famous Italian scraper Fernando Galliano and is valued at $250,000.
Only a few slices to the scripture are estimated at $16-18 thousand.
The investigation found that the worm was not so recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the tool was returned to the legitimate owner.
Until now, it is unknown how the wreck came to the man who drove it into a lombard, but there are no previous collisions with the law behind him.
The manager says that now all who bring the lombard scripture will be asked to play on it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: "Spartak" will take on his stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valery Carpin - a man, as known, not a stranger "national team".
The particular picantity of this meeting is that the clubs now have the same number of points - 15 and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, leaving away from the far jumped "Zenit" and being in one point from "Krasnodar", who tomorrow plays with "Dinamo".
The red and white now have a difficult line: the club is again surrounded by stupid scandals, in the League of Europe the team of Masimo Carrera suddenly entered the Rapid, and recently left the house of Ahmat.
After a derby with the CSKA, which ended with a fair niche, "Spartak" with a minimal account and not hardly overwhelmed the Cup "Black Sea", and it's too early to talk about whether the most popular club of Russia has approached the outcome from the crisis.
"Rostov" couldn't win three matches in a row, but the defeats didn't know five matches.
Let’s see if Karpin will be able to extend the unbeatable series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsky "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favour of the capital team.
Start at 19:00.

London accuses Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the outcomes of the Cold War, Britain's Defense Minister Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he emphasized during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
The threat is increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are acting in grey zones through cyber attacks and false news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which increases its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it will not comply with international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the history of poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year, former GRU Colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying in favour of the UK, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on membership in the EU and NATO under the condition of the country’s name being changed.
The referendum is called to resolve a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece on the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first voted Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a hot supporter of the Republic's change in northern Macedonia.
The preparations for the referendum and today’s vote are monitored by international organizations.
The head of the Observatory Mission of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers is organized:
Approximately 100 teams have travelled across the country to monitor today the entire process, from the opening of the electoral spaces to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.

The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a great role for mutual understanding.
This was on the International Translator's Day on September 30, by professional translator-synchronist Berbel Saxe.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
“The Germans like to plan the events quietly, and the Russians, as it is said in the proverb, ‘take a long time to go quickly.’”
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between the peoples and for the work of the translator it doesn’t play a heavy role,” the specialist said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can’t deal without each other, “it’s enough to know history.”
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany has no sense to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no sense to try to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common fate,” she said.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country is trying to "connect" relations with Russia and support them.
According to her, for Berlin mania is important the project of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline, which is built from the coast of Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

The Night School Comedy Headed the American Box Office
The comedy "Night School", which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend in sale.
This result allowed the unthinkable picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Hadish in the main roles to lead the U.S. box office for 28-30 September.
On the international market, the film, so far released in only 20 countries, collected $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which notably, quite sensitively preceded another novice of the western procat - the cartoon "Smolfuth", a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in whose existence the main character never believed.
The project of directors Carrie Kirkpatrick and Jason Raysig for their start-up weekends raised $23 million, in general justifying the expectations of experts predicting the film 20-25 million per weekend.
As for the sum fees of Smolfit, at the moment they are $38.6 million (at the same time he debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, filling the film's treasury by $3.6 million.
Three of the strongest this time was closed by the children's story "The Secret of the House with the Hours" from the master of horrors Elijah Rota, finally demonstrating that the director knows how to make a quality film and for the audience 12+.
For her second week in procurement, the screenplay of John Bellers' book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide fees to $53.8 million.
Despite the flight from the top-3, it continues to surprise with the "+" trailer with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple Request": in 17 days in the American procat the picture of Paul Figue, from which some unrealistic financial achievements originally didn't wait for the word "total", gathered $43 million (including $6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has up to $62.9 million in total revenue.
The last representative of the first five this week was the horror "The Curse of the Monk", which collected $5.4 million for the reporting period.
Spin-off "The Curse" in the 24 days in American (and not only, of course) theaters has a $330 million total earnings and has recently proudly been the title of the most successful franchise film, which also includes two parts of the "The Curse" and two tricks about the horrible doll Annabel.
Right behind Corina Hardy's horror on the results of last weekend was another representative of the genre - the debutant "Hallfest", one of the main youth horrors of the year.
In his first weekends, the childhood of the famous monter (and from recent directors) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked in a number of major horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death", which "Halfest" places very similar, earned in the US $5.1 million.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
The seventh "Frazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which seems not to think to fall out of the top 10 American box office: a romantic comedy, living on the screens for the seventh week, according to the results of September is the sixth in the ranking of the most cash tape of the genre throughout history with an index of 165.7 million.
This is the amount of the painting at the moment earned on the domestic market - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky people who fell in the top ten in the U.S. charges for 28-30 September, they became "The Hunter", "White Boy Rick" and "Bagrow Meat", earning the last weekend respectively $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million.
We will add that in the next weekends in the United States will all gather the long-awaited "Venus" with Tom Hardy, who - in this can be undoubted - without special problems will conquer the leadership in the U.S. box office on the results of the first weekend of October.
From the other premiere of the coming week, it is worth distinguishing the musical-melodram "The Star was born", the Venetian Film Festival laureate by Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your hatred".

Valery Belov: God helped Siberia today
The main coach of "Vitia" Valery Belov - about the defeat from "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
“The colleague talked about the fans of Siberia, and I want to celebrate our fans,” Belov said on the official website of Vitiya.
“I hope they will support the same, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
By the game, God probably helped Siberia today, because they were very seriously mistaken, especially our leaders.
Overall, the micro-match lost 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was hard for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
However, I will still be guilty of myself.
Because, apparently, they missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last match, it was a different team.”
“This is a disgraceful humiliation.”
The viewers are angry with the choice of Agutin for the show "Voice"
The viewers of the "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "immaginary humiliation and naked submissions."
When in blind hearing he first noticed the voice of his father Nicholas Agutin, many hoped that he would retain neutrality and not turn to the executor.
But the sons of the feelings took the top, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but they forgived the mentor the objectivity at the first stage.
But the "shock" was delayed, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiedly took the place of more decent performers.
And now the viewers are not ready to forgive Agutin for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the show’s viewers, were angry with the humiliation of the immaculate and honest pushing our close relatives to the final staircase.
I had even doubts that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience to not put his father to the end already to the first place,” Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larin discussed in the program “Man from TV”.
Meanwhile, for his father, Leonid Agutin "silled" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich spoke a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what the viewers still want to see in the show of his father.
But, as it turned out, it’s not all right, the viewers want an objective assessment and see in the final really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
“I condemn the voters from the Agutin team – they were condemned.”
“Last time Agutin showed how he loves the pope, and today he had to show himself a professional.”
“The competition has lost its meaning.”
“To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project your father who doesn’t sing but screams, how can you then call a mentor?”
“I like how a father sings, organize him a concert in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to this concert.”
This is the show “Voice” and not the show “Crute Families”.
“It was unprofessional from the side of Agutin.”
“Then you have to offer you to perform on your own show, not on a show that is done for the money of Channel 1.”
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don’t understand why a voiceless pope should cause me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut, with a great voice and timbre, melted and Pope Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on the scene and on the screens the same faces for decades!
“Because you don’t go through the curvature!”
“What did you expect?
This is Russia!
A circle of blats and humidity.
The money in the family budget will not be excessive.
The theatre of absurdity continues!
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind hearing came out the son of the City.
Then the meter and the head did not come to take the son into his own team.
Moreover, he said, “Go, go from here, everything is clear.”
Agustin was unable to act as a professional.
Canadian soldiers are allowed to wear brads to raise spirit

The head of the Institute of Space Studies of the RAN, member-correspondent of the RAN Anatoly Petrovich told RIA Novosti about the possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the Moon.
According to him, the scientific community is currently developing the directions of such works.

He noted that one of the options is the placement of a low-frequency radio telescope on the reverse side of the moon, which would allow to avoid interference that is the source of the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to explore spatial radiation sources," Petrovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used for testing by robotics, using local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be attracted to the search of primitive organics on the Earth satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.

Carrey’s actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unclean stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera does.
This only deepens the disturbance in the team.
First, they are poems, you can read and perceive them as you want.
I’t react to this at Carrera’s place.
Everyone has his own opinion.
And everyone wants to be buried.
If Gluchakov and Echenko put the leaves, it doesn’t mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italians lack the flexibility of perception of the situation.
And this does not serve the normal climate in the team.
Today Spartacus has no game, so this situation was not required to flourish at all.
Maybe it was worth laughing on this together.

Sirius educators discussed natural-like technologies with scientists
Educators of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture of scientists of the National Research Center "Kurchatovsky Institute".

The lectures of the scientist are published on the "Sirius" website.
The students learned that modern technologies need a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
To solve this problem, the organizers of the forum said, will help the natural-like technologies on which young scientists are working today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, and also told about the risks that inevitably arise in the creation of such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal good.
This is the explosive growth of medical technologies, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also the second side.
The development of natural-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of the systems of the living nature.
There is a reverse side - a targeted interference in the life activity of a person.
Risk is always there.
A car appeared and people died under the wheels.
The cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I create medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass defeat," the scientist REN TV quotes.

Kemerovchan harassed a cattle of barns at the cemetery
On September 30 on the famous Kemerovskaya page on the social network appeared a message from a witness that roughly animals are free to walk around one of the local cemetery.

There is nothing to do with the bars.
About the barns, of course, you won’t say that they’re cushioning, but it’s not a matter of it.” (the style is preserved) – said in her message the angry Kemerovchenka.

Pressing and touching – how right?
There are no words to press.
Right to touch.
The word "touch" in the meaning of "touch, influence, influence" exists only phoneticly, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "touch".
We use this word, believing that it comes from the word “pressure”.
But the “pressure” and “take” are ethymologically not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Make sure that yourself.
To get (the church-book, the old) means "to be enough, full, enough, to be enough for someone or something, to satisfy."
To be satisfied, pleasure is family words.
In the past, he had the meaning of “not to depend on anything, to have self-satisfactory meaning” – “to satisfy yourself.”
The old Slavic “duality” is related to the words “will” and “will”.
Pressing and suppressing are completely different.
These words are truly frightening "families": daos is "wolf" (who gives a sheep), deyja is "to die" and twoidī is "to worry".
Similar phonetic appearance of the words “pressure” and “take”, as well as the inevitable aging of the latter, forced them to get into contamination.
So we have this same “d” that is used in the letter through “a”, which is better, wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the appearance and development of these words.
So, it is right to get.
But this word is obsolete, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press”.
You can also use the design "to show pressure", but remember that it cancellates.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia defended itself from terrorists
In three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Air and Space Forces.
This was in connection with the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the U.S. Air Force, the head of the Committee of the Federation Council on Defense and Security, Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air damage means: Air and space forces have and continue to make all attacks exactly on the objects of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, in three years, tens of thousands of terrorist objects have been destroyed in Syria, for example, ammunition warehouses, fortress and headquarters.
With the help of the Russian airstrikes the defense of the jihadists was broken – it became a decisive contribution to the advancement of the government troops in Syria, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our soldiers in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, prohibited in Russia) and the Jebhat-an-Nusru (prohibited in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from the Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries were fighting on the side of the Islamic State.
And it is only about the registered persons, not counting those who were not identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take weapons in their hands, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on the far borders - otherwise this evil "will flow to us."

The Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to change the name of the UPC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of Foreign Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Ylarion compared the renamed of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists towards Jews.
“It’s all the same that in fascist Germany the Jews have a yellow star, that’s to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and for this purpose this bill was created,” the Metropolitan said in a broadcast on Russia-24 (interfax).
According to him, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kyiv thus hopes to get full control over the UPC and "to put it out of law," the priest believes.
“This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are the patriots of their country,” he added.
Deputies of the Verkhovna Rada work on the implementation of the bills No. 4128 (on the change of the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change of the name of religious organizations).
The latter involves the change of name of the UPC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of the Orthodoxy and Ukrainian saints
The Deputy of the St. Uspensky Pochaev Lavra Metropolitan Vladimir appealed to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian saints.
The text of his address to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on Saturday on the site of the residence.
In different times of history, our predecessors and their relatives in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and defend their saints.
Given the situation that has occurred, and the information we have, and the threats of the discussions that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something," the Metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
The labyrinth deputy also emphasized that it is likely that “you will need your physical presence.”
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren, by spirit, are threatened by dispute, and therefore we will protect our saint."
Whoever is not indifferent to the fate of the Pocayev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world saint, must be ready to defend it.
The Metropolitan called for not to go on the matter of those who put the believers into misconduct.
The UPC has a canonical status determined by Thomas on 29 October 1990 by the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to put into dependence on the newly-known Patriarch and a friend of the Catholic Pope of the Roman Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” the labyrinth deputy said.
He recalled that the UPC has since October 1990 been canonically independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Thomas our church already has.
What more Tomos we need?" - said the Metropolitan Pochaevsky Vladimir, calling on the believers and all citizens to ask whether other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Those who believed in some extent decided and decided to which temple they should go.
But somebody wants to sow enemies and disputes again.
Some are jealous that the tombs are shining in the temples they want to destroy,” the priest said.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The labyrinth is located on the top of the Pocayev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Turin.
The first historical information about it refers to the beginning of the 13th century.

The world lion has posted another sad post on Instagram, which has disgraced its subscribers.
“I’ve never thought that feelings could have a price.
Life continues to teach me... and when I begin to understand in people,” Buzova wrote.
Many fans reacted negatively to such a post and noted that the singer actually "no saw the real life."
“You have not suffered yet.
You stick to every word, live in a normal, ordinary family,” she wrote @nataliamama37.
There were also those who advised Buzova to go to psychologists or at least read books on this topic.
"Can it be worth reading literature on psychology?
What do you have to do so that you don’t get off the victim?” — wrote @liashukgalina.
But there were those who supported the singer.
“Ola, you, the most important thing, don’t be scared.
Your man will not speak loud words throughout the country and then simply do not perform them," - supported Buzova @arina_prostyle.
“You are a queen and you need a king, and the one who has changed you on paper is just not worthy of you.
Up your nose and go further,” she wrote @kreszentia_f.
Previously, Nazarov explained his decision to take 2 million rubles and give up Buzova with the fact that the singer has no sympathy to him.
He decided to send all the money to charity.
If we continue to play well, the victories will come.
The main coach of the Moscow "Dinamo" Vladimir Vorobyev - about the defeat from "Automobilist" (0:1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"A good game was, interesting, although it went to the goal," said Vorobyeva's official website "Automobilista".
“We tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
I did not use some good moments.
In the second season, the opponent struck us a little, we stood.
But the removal “fooded” us a little.
The boys played well, performed the trainer.
I think if we continue to play well, the victories will come.
Not hit, with zero goals the game is not winning, but the content of the game was right.
The luck will come if we continue to play in that direction.”
"Do you think the "Automobilist" has added compared to the meetings in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“There was no foreign team at that time.

U.S. to increase the production of opiates in Afghanistan
About the sharp deterioration of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26th, a lot was spoken in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on the territory of Afghanistan, the militants launched a real terrorist war against the authorities of the state and the civilian population of the country.
The current year has become a record in the number of bloody terror attacks, resulting in the deaths of thousands of simple Afghan people," Patrushev said.
The trouble in Afghanistan began far from yesterday.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the terrorist group Al-Qaeda (prohibited in the Russian Federation) was declared the main enemy of the United States, settling in Afghanistan.
It has not passed a month since the United States and NATO allies started the military operation “Unbreakable Freedom”.
It has passed 17 years.
Thousands of American contingents are now in Afghanistan.
And peaceful life is even more ghost than it was then.
U.S. troops are caught for blocking dozens of their bases.
As they can, they are bought off from the militants for money - just not to touch them.
The government of Afghanistan controls a small part of the country’s territory – 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% of the Taliban movement (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they grow quickly there.
The goal - to create a barbaric pseudo-chaliphate in Central Asia - is exactly the one they did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
America, according to me, is happy.
In 17 years of U.S. presence, the production of drugs (opiotics) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth of spaces filled with opium mack and billions of profits.
The Macedonians are preparing to vote on a referendum on membership in the EU and NATO subject to the change of the country’s name.
The agreement on the translation of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize for its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, considering in such a name a attempt on the same name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “Through this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope of social changes.
Greece has the right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy."
For the country's change of name are ruling social-democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
The opposite is the conservative opposition and the president of the country, Georgy Ivanov.
According to the journalist Cvetina Chilimanova, Macedonia has no sense to join the EU – it is enough to have partnerships with it: “Many of those who don’t like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is forced from the outside to change the country’s name.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans."
Fei Dulgery, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was dissolved.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
