Professor calls 911 and confesses to killing his girlfriend.
University professor Shannon Lamb, calling 911, said that the cop shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police should come to the house, only his voice was trembling.
Lamb stated that his "beloved dog" was alive and possibly upset, and that the dead woman's family's phone numbers could be found on her cell phone.
The police found the body of Amy Prentiss in the house, along with a note handwritten in a white notebook, signed by Lamb, which read: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn everything around, I loved Amy so much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me".
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the campus of the school where police believe beloved history professor Ethan Schmidt was shot and killed by Lamb outside his office.
Delta State Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university officials heard shots at 10:18.
He also said that Lamb made the grisly 911 call shortly afterwards.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as police approached him.
A day after the school shooting left students and teachers hiding behind locked doors, authorities are still trying to figure out what drove Lamb to do it.
The details, gleaned from investigators on both sides of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to entering his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said that Lamb had no criminal or criminal record.
In fact, Schmidt once described Lamb in a book as one of the "wonderful people" he shared his academic life with.
Both had taught in the Department of Social Science and History, which listed 17 faculty members, and many students took classes from both.
However, there were also indications of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke highly of Lamb, noted that he was also an anxious and tense person, and that he "looked like he had a problem".
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was struggling with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously requested a sick leave from Delta State University, stating that he had some health issues.
She only gave two online classes this year.
Recent changes to the university's hiring policies did not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a tenured faculty member, despite the doctoral degree he worked so hard to earn.
William LaForge, the dean of the university, said he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was clear that Lamb had something on his mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was evacuated, police traced Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County forensic investigator Methel Johnson revealed that Lamb had committed suicide with a single .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a home about a mile from his family's home in the Greenville suburb of Mississippi before he was arrested.
Lamb's car was found on the highway, running.
Although it was not immediately clear why Lamb had come to the house, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in the house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a town of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and education.
She got her doctorate in education last spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through their partners.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was a big, sweet guy who tried to teach guitar for a few years.
He was a heartthrob back then.
Hairston, now 40 and living in the Jackson suburb of Brandon, said of Lamb, "When he came, all the girls melted".
Lamb and Prentiss have obviously been together for a while.
Although Lamb said in his 911 call that he killed his wife, there's no official record of them ever marrying.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the banks of a river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and now have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also said that his daughter was in a state of complete devastation.
He and his mother were two great friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and had heard him play the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail were onstage at a summer festival.
And then Lamb and Abigail played together in public shows.
O'Steen stated that he wrote and sang his daughter's music himself.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dingy bar near Gautier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5, after Lamb had finished playing guitar and banjo to a small crowd.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a very happy couple.
Sometimes we'd cut and throw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, professor of English at the same university, noted that the murdered professor directed Schmidt's seminar program for freshmen and was an expert on Native Americans and colonial history.
He was married and had three teenage children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of a student solidarity group he founded.
On Tuesday night, about 900 people attended the candle-laying ceremony on the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland, including academics, university staff, students, and visitors from the local community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the memorial, where the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Magnificent Zarafet".
Classes are back on Wednesday.
LaForge said, "We're trying to bring our students back".
The crisis is over.
Time to heal the wounds.
This is Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to this story.
This story text has been edited to reflect the fact that police said Lamb called 911 after killing Schmidt and that no official evidence has been found that the two were married, despite Lamb's referring to Prentiss as his "wife" in the 911 call.
Toys R Us is planning to hire fewer holiday season staff.
Toys R Us has announced that it will not hire as many holiday season employees this year as last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer has said that the firm will allow more work for existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it planned to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, up from 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs will be part-time.
The company said that interviews with candidates will begin this month and that the number of staff will increase from October to December.
With months to go before the holiday season, the holiday shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to equip their stores and hire temporary workers to help them sell, ship and distribute their goods.
Michael J. Fox jokingly claims he had an affair with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a momentous occasion for Michael J. Fox.
It was also very important for personal reasons.
In the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time, he describes it this way: "We were sitting in the cinema hall waiting for the Royal Family to arrive, and I suddenly noticed that the seat next to me was empty and I knew that Princess Diana would be sitting next to me.
The film started and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and arm-length away from me.
Back in Time, a documentary about the film Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future was first envisioned 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time-travel movie I've ever made".
Back in Time will be available in VOD and DVD formats, as well as select theaters.
UN Chief Says There is No Military Solution in Syria
On Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that the Syrian crisis, which has lasted for nearly five years, "can't be resolved by military intervention" and that more weapons would only lead to more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to come together for constructive talks with the aim of finding a political solution to the problem.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he planned to discuss Syria with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the UN General Assembly, the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France, at a meeting of the UN General Assembly later this month.
It expressed great regret that the division between the council members and the Syrian people "has made the problem insoluble" by regional powers.
Ban called on the five permanent members to unite in the Syrian crisis, as they did in the Iran nuclear deal.
8 Polling Facts That Prove Donald Trump is Serious
Some have tried to label him a firebrand.
The others threw it at him as if it was a joke.
And some of them support the internal explosion.
Some Republicans have tried to push Donald Trump down in the polls, but it hasn't worked (yet).
The latest 11 national polls have put Donald Trump's lead in the double digits, and some are starting to seriously question the real estate emperor's chances of running.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump can win the Republican nomination.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise in 2011 coincided with Herman Cain's rise, both of whom failed to win a single state's nominating process.
And there are plenty of reasons why he's gonna have a hard time in the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative group, the Growth Club, are realizing Trump's lasting power and are pouring their dollars into trying to bring him down.
Here are some recent survey results that show that the real estate emperor is not just a passing fad:
Trump's approval ratings have changed 180 degrees.
A poll conducted at Monmouth University just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two in 10 Republicans had a favorable opinion of the real estate emperor.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of 10 have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are skyrocketing in the early stages.
Last week, a poll in Quinnipiac, Iowa, showed that 60 percent of Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters are likely to be pleased with Trump's nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be "excited" or "satisfied" if Trump ran.
Only two in 10 said they would be "disappointed" if he was nominated.
Only Ben Carson is as excited as Trump (43% said they would be "excited" and 40% for Trump).
The other person closest to the fire?
Marco Rubio is only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be "not happy" or "sad" if Jeb Bush, the party's favorite, ran.
A majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been criticized for his flashy language and insults, according to a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll, 52 percent of Republicans polled think the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president.
The same number is true in Iowa, where the nation's first party convention is being held, where according to Quinnipac last week, 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be the leader.
Still 44 percent think he doesn't have the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six in 10 independents say his character doesn't fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, when asked who the best candidate is to win the GOP nomination, four out of 10 people said Trump is the best.
That's a change from the end of July when four out of 10 people put their money in Jeb Bush's bank.
Full disclosure: In the past, the GOP voter crystal ball was not very clear.
In the last election cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be the nominee, compared to only 28 percent who voted for Mitt Romney, who eventually ran.
Still, it seems that a majority of GOP voters find Trump's campaign reasonable.
Even if the Republicans rally around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the sparse field could also contribute to Trump's rise, and it's also true that anti-Trump support is scattered among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll conducted in early September showed that in the event of a head-to-head matchup between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump would receive a majority of support each time.
Carly Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Christie with 33 points each.
A tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In a possible one-on-one, Ben Carson is 19 points ahead of the businessman.
The vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll released Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who supported Trump said they had locked in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can say that they're not going to change their minds.
46 percent said they left the door open to change candidates.
Trump's biggest opponent is still neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've made up their minds are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Immigration has been at the forefront and the center of conversations in 2016 since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "aggressors" in his campaign manifesto two months ago.
Some believe Trump's heavy-talking has alienated key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and will damage his re-branding efforts.
But a new ABC/Post poll released Monday shows that six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as the issue of immigration is on the agenda, it looks like Trump will be on the agenda.
Anger at the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson, by virtue of their largely outsider status, are getting roughly half the Republican vote.
In a new ABC/Post poll on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they want someone from the outside instead of someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa are angry at Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "displeased" and 21 percent "extremely angry".
Jeremy Corbyn will take the stage for the first time in the Prime Minister's Questions.
Mr Corbyn's rise to the podium on the Prime Minister's Questions programme has been eagerly awaited since his election.
The new Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will take the stage for the first time since David Cameron at the Prime Minister's Questions.
Mr. Corbyn will be asking six questions shortly after noon, and his performance will be closely scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theater and more reality" at the weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions to his colleagues.
This will be the first parliamentary test of Mr Corbyn's leadership, following his appointment to the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual convention on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem at a commemoration to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has been criticised by some Tory MPs and is the focus of front-page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national march was noted.
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he stood in "a respectful silence" and praised "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
But Owen Smith, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
With about a dozen shadow ministers refusing to serve on Mr Corbyn's senior team because of differences over the economy, defence and foreign affairs, less than a sixth of those in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that policy differences within the Labour Party are starting to "accumulate" and that they are Mr Corbyn's appointment over the EU's position and the government's imposition of the top aid limit.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that he had proposed new changes to remove the upper limit of the Labour Party altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow minister for work and pensions, said the party was only opposed to the government lowering the upper limit from £26,000 to £23,000 and was "very clear" about it.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the House of Commons since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader has promised a different approach to politics and said he's "people-sourced" and has received over 30,000 referrals to ask Mr Cameron.
Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Q&amp;A programme was too restrictive and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people rather than "growing up" and making sarcastic puns.
Mr. Corbyn has said that when he is not present, for example when Mr. Cameron travels abroad, he will be represented on the Prime Minister's Question Time programme by Angela Eagle, the shadow trade secretary.
He even suggested that other colleagues should take the stage at times, and he said he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to address the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "puppet" politics often associated with the Prime Minister's Questions programme, but a few years later he admitted he had failed in this regard.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions programme has been used as a key benchmark to gauge leaders' decision-making abilities, their authority in the House of Commons and their position among MPs, although some critics have suggested that it is caricatured and that far-reaching reforms are needed.
'Shot in Joburg': Homeless youths trained in photography
Downtown Johannesburg is a tough place for the homeless.
But a group of former street kids have found a new skill and a way to make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take pictures of their neighborhoods and earn a living from it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

The pound is rising as UK wage increases accelerate
The FTSE 100 index rose after the takeover bid for SABMills, while the pound sterling rose rapidly following data showing that wages in the UK were rising.
Wages excluding premiums in the United Kingdom increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period the previous year.
This is the fastest increase since 2009 and is also seen as a leading indicator of possible interest rate increases.
Sterling gained more than 1% against the US dollar to $1,5505, and against the euro it gained 0.84% to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index rose 1.49% to 6,229.21 points, which is a slight increase.
The company that stood out the most in this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase in the attractive takeover bid received from its rival AB InBev.
This deal will bring together the two largest brewing companies in the world and well-known brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch under one roof.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% on positive earnings news from rival luxury retailer Richemont.
Richemont's recent sales figures have exceeded expectations, as well as showing that sales are beginning to pick up again in China, one of Burberry's key markets.
Mining giant Glencore shares rose 5% after it announced it had raised $2.5 billion from the sale of its allotted shares as part of the company's debt-reduction strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mondi's shares were among the most impacted, losing 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded its offer for the company to "Sat".
JD Sports's shares rose 3.1% after the company announced that its six-month pre-tax profit rose by 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports' boss said higher salaries could hurt expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill said that higher minimum wage for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But he said that the expense was too great for his company to afford.
He added that the cost would affect JD Sports' expansion plans and that it would mean less extra work.
Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to fight the Aldi invasion.
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market leader Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend its retail stores in South Australia and Western Australia against a $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open the first of two distribution centres and up to 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and trying to build the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide Fair.
IGA bakers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, which offers flavour tests in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell South Australian Football League tickets at a discount to their loyal customers.
Food, beverage and hardware wholesaler Metcash is expected to provide more details on its defense strategy when it revisits its annual investor strategy day on September 29.
The risk is high, as South Australia and Western Australia represent almost 30% of Metcash's IGA store footprint, and Metcash generates higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states.
South Australian and Western Australian store owners are negatively narrow-minded and IGA retailers enjoy a much stronger market share than they have in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in GA and 24% more in BA than in the Eastern states.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that within 12 months of Aldi opening its first stores in these two states, it will capture about 5% of the market, taking sales from existing players but generally unconventional retailers.
In a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers will lose $360 million in one year and Metcash will lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
That's based on Aldi's prediction that it will open 25 stores in GA and 30 in the U.K. next year, and generate $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr. Kierath noted that the loss of food and grocery sales and Metcash's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash approximately $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, primarily Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research that revealed IGA customers are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and grocery sales will decline by 3.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017, and 2.1% in 2018, which will reduce its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder and lead fund manager Hamish Douglass said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "could very well be wiped out in a decade".
Metcash refused to respond to Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA's market share has declined from 18% to 14% since 2010, and its earnings from the food and grocery business, which supplies Metcash's approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, an indication of a decline in the leverage ratio of the business as sales and margins have come under pressure.
But the wholesaler is holding up, investing more than $150 million a year in Coles and Woolworths to match shelf prices on hundreds of products every week, helping IGA retailers revamp their stores, add faster-growing fresh foods and open a better private-label chain to the public.
Metcash executive chairman Ian Morrice says that price matching and store renewal programs are starting to pay off, and that wholesale is expected to return to base profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is backed by Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise for his behavior than criticism.
Tennis Australia president Steve Healy said that Thanasi Kokkinakis was the casual casualty of the recent storm that swept around her friend Nick Kyrgios, and that she deserved much praise from the critics.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo normally referred to as the "Special K's", found himself under unwelcome spotlight as Kyrgios' face-crushing win over Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a tough elimination match played this afternoon in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the referee, with Harrison declaring, "Wawrinka came at Kyrgios, and I have to go at that kid".
Kokkinakis, who was last seen at the US Open, potentially breaking Richard Gasquet's racket in a way that would have been unpleasant, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The youngster is currently competing for the second singles title behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semi-final in Glasgow alongside Sam Groth.
Healy said, "What I feel very passionately is that I think Thanasi is a little bit drawn to the argument".
He broke his racket when he was shut out and lost in the US, but he's not the first player to break his racket because he's disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn't be proud of that.
But in reality, in the United States, with Harrison and the others, under extremely provocative circumstances, he has done quite well, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think he's been pushed a little too far.
Although he's 19 years old, he's extremely mature, he's working hard and he's fit for the team, he has no problems with the other players, he's very well respected in the dressing room, he's training hard, he's a very balanced and mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged by his standards.
Healy also supported the decision to favour Kyrgios for the important draw; starting on Friday, he explained that the right thing for everyone was to "decide in a reciprocal way" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term anchor.
"Above all", said Healy, "we want the team to focus entirely on the game, not on the controversy around [Kyrgios]".
And I think that the kid has risen very quickly, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, growing up in the public eye and making some terrible mistakes and deserving all the criticism that he's getting, but we're trying to support him, trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not in the spotlight, he's thinking deeply that my thinking is right, that it's best for the team and for him.
European migrant crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders and detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, closing its southern border with Serbia and detaining those trying to enter the country illegally in an attempt to stem the flow of migrants.
The mass of hundreds of migrants in the neutral zone created chaos at the border and the Serbian authorities reacted with anger.
Migrants fleeing violence in their own countries have been camping on the roadside between checkpoints in both countries for an indefinite period of time.
But their anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed overhead, migrants shouted "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian police.
Some refused to accept food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was "unacceptable" that Hungary was sending back migrants while the migration flow from Macedonia and Greece was continuing.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to be harmed by this process.
In the coming days, we will have to hold talks with Brussels and other countries", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border comes just one day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common migration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 migrants who have invaded Greece and Italy, and expressed hope that an agreement could be reached on the admission of another 120,000 migrants, including those from Hungary, to EU countries by next month or the end of the year.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for an EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the matter.
The emergency call issued Tuesday in two southern regions gives authorities wide-ranging powers to deal with the crisis, including closing roads if necessary and speeding up asylum-seekers' cases.
On the other hand, the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that after the barbed wire his country had erected on the border with Serbia, he planned to erect barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from this country.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata reports that prisoners have even been assigned to work on the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become a key gateway and transit point to European Union countries, and a large proportion of these migrants are refugees fleeing the wars in Syria and other Middle Eastern countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of migrants are "economic migrants" seeking a better life in Europe, rather than innocent people fleeing war - a view that is in stark contrast to that of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that took effect at midnight in Hungary criminalize crossing or damaging a 13-foot (4-meter) long barbed wire fence along the border with Serbia, and impose harsher penalties on human traffickers.
Speaking to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass migration".
We have a clear idea: it's a crime to cross the border illegally.
While the deployment has yet to be approved by the council, Associated Press reporters in the area say they've seen soldiers with dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people who tried to cross the border and 15 who had crossed the border into the country.
They've broken through the barbed wire, and now they're in police custody and charged with felonies under the new law.
Authorities are speeding to repair the barbed wire.
Hungarian authorities also used a train car covered in barbed wire to close one of the crossings, while closing two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning.
The chaos has also spread to the main border crossing near Roszke, with the Hungarians setting up a small metal container where people are crowded to make transactions.
20 people could get in, but thousands were left out.

Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders in the national election is cut in half
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Sen. Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%) while Sanders is in second place with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced his candidacy, is receiving 15% of the Democratic vote.
For more than five months before the primary, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
But Clinton supporters have a stronger view of their own elections than the other candidates.
Since CBS News last month, Clinton has been losing ground among a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton's leading with a big margin between women and moderates, but that's closing.
The male support has dropped dramatically, and Sanders is only five points behind him.
Clinton's under-50 Democrat voting advantage has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now on equal footing.
But Clinton is a huge lead in senior voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading the Liberals by double digits, but now Sanders is leading that group by five.
Nationally, about half of Democratic voters say they would passionately support Clinton if he were the nominee.
A quarter would support him on some terms, while another 15 percent would support him only if he ran.
Six percent of the people don't support Clinton.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters tend to support him especially passionately.
Opinions among those who don't support Clinton right now are even more mixed - only a quarter may support him passionately.
48% of Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, while fewer talk about their Republican front-runner Donald Trump (35%).
When asked open-ended questions about why they wanted Clinton to be the nominee, the first-ranking answers were that Clinton had the right experience (16 percent), that it was time to elect a woman president (13 percent), and that she was the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton's supporters also cite her relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Compromise in matters and electability are also among the criteria stated.
As a potential vice president, 57 percent of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race, but a third don't.
When asked by Democratic voters what their second choice for the party is, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say Biden could be their second choice by a wide margin, according to Sander.
If Biden does not enter the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders increases from 20 points in a Biden-on race to 30 points in a Biden-on-no race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters say Clinton has the best chance of winning the general election, but that number has dropped to 78 percent from last month.
Biden is second in this regard, but far behind, but the percentage of those who see him as the most likely candidate has increased.
Again, when asked what's most important about a candidate, Democratic voters put electability ahead of the issue.
As in the last month, no Democratic candidate or nominee appears to be considered a candidate for this primary.
Democratic candidates or nominees perform well in some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, as well as having strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the top three honesty man, while Clinton is the strongest leader.
Thirty percent of Democrats say Clinton is not honest or trustworthy, half of them say the same about Sanders, while 27 percent have no idea.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as aligned with their ideology.
By all measures, a quarter of the Democratic electorate has no idea about Sanders.
With questions still lingering about his use of his personal email address and server while in the State Department, most Democratic voters are satisfied with the explanation and say their views on him have not been affected.
But that's a different story in the American public.
Half the Americans are no longer satisfied with his explanations, and only a third find them satisfactory.
Public opinion on the issue was divided in March, shortly after the issue was taken under control.
Most Americans say the email controversy hasn't affected their overall opinion of Clinton, but there's been a 36 percent increase in negative opinions.
These are Republicans in general, and more than six in 10 say they're upset about Clinton.
While Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by voters in her own party, this is still a problem among registered voters overall: only 32% consider her honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't think he's honest or trustworthy.
And 55 percent of registered voters nationwide don't think Trump is honest or trustworthy either.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good marks for leadership.
Of the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored the highest in honesty.
More like Sanders, mostly honest, but like Carson, most of them have no idea what he's like.
The margin of error in the sample of 351 Democratic voters is 6 points.
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that the two candidates have matched the votes of about half the electorate, and the other candidates have little chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with support climbing from 23% in the latest CBS poll conducted before last month's debate on Fox News to 27% in the poll released Tuesday.
But support for Carson has risen from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson did well across demographic groups, with support among college graduate Republican voters much higher than Trump's.
The rest, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, are down to 2% from 10% last month with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The margin of error in this latest poll of 376 Republican voters is 6%, and the poll was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's support among Republicans at 19%, just behind Trump's 32%.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post also puts Trump seriously ahead of Carson.
Faced with Carson's rise to power last week, Trump continued to randomly shake his retired neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
At a campaign stop in Iowa, Trump said last Saturday, "We need energy".
Five members of the fraternity are charged with the murder of a freshman at Baruch College.
Nearly two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity induction ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity severely attacked Chun "Michael" Deng at an initiation ceremony in September 2013, and according to police, contributed to his death by delaying taking him to the hospital.
Authorities report that he was blindfolded, strapped to the back of a backpack full of 30 pounds of sand, and repeatedly nailed while trying to walk to a target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that he had a headache and then lost consciousness.
Delta Pi fraternity members didn't call 911 after Deng collapsed, and police say they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
But according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke at the press conference, they had in the meantime changed Deng's clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google, and contacted the fraternity's national president, Andy Meng, for advice.
At this point, Commissioner Wagner said, the members began to hide personal belongings and put the good of the brotherhood before Michael Deng.
He was unresponsive and died the next morning.
An autopsy report shows that Deng suffered trauma from repeated blows to the head, torso and buttocks from a blunt object.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement that many families have been broken up as a result of the Brotherhood's admissions ceremonies, and that at least one student has died at an admission ceremony every year since 1970.
The fraternities and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County grand jury recommended that the first five members be tried for murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assault, felony, and felony assault.
Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday that not only would we hold those involved responsible, but if there was an organization that officially or unofficially confirmed it, we would hold them accountable.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity ended its relationship with this local chapter.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
As interest rates rise, the bull market is in turmoil, bond yields are climbing, and the economy is in recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how soon or how long it's going to happen.
History, especially in economics, offers very little information about timing.
The recession has been as long as 86 months, as the first rate hike was followed by a short recession of about 11 months.
The Fed's aggressiveness in raising interest rates has, if not consistently, often been decisive in the response of economic and financial actors.
That's why U.S. central bankers have been so vocal in emphasizing that investors should focus on how long the normalization process will take, not when interest rates will start to rise.
It's a fact that there are a lot of variables.
But the result is that market participants may think the interest rate hike has been exaggerated.
"It is inevitable that the Fed's first rate hike since the global financial crisis will be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of 'cheap money,'" said Julian Jessop, Global Chief Economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we don't expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal, but the levels that are still low seem to be the seismic shock that most fear.
Still, we can't say it won't have an effect.
Based on past trends, some areas of the economy might respond:
As the market has seen in recent months, expecting interest rates to rise can destabilize things for a while.
And when the interest rate is raised, the effect is not so obvious.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed hikes, Deutsche Bank analysts say that "the yield on equities appears to have a 12-24 month flat trend after the first rate hike, which may reflect the stagnation in monetary policy".
According to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, an analyst at Nuveen Wealth Management, at Barron's, the market has generally seen sharp increases over the past 35 years - around 14 percent - and then a flat line toward an increase in interest rates after 250 days (an average increase of 2.6 percent) and then back to normal after 500 days, yielding an average of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the effect on equities became more pronounced in the later stages of the rate hike cycle, and the yield was on the verge of disappearing.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases help them out.
The Fed is currently facing some unprecedented conditions that could accelerate the downturn.
The most striking thing is that the gross domestic product is at the lowest level ever for a Fed rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118-percent increase since 1950, nominal year-over-year gross domestic product has only twice fallen below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.6 percent, according to the Atlanta Fed, few expect this to be permanent, with the third quarter seeing a 1.5 percent rate.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment could be risky and could lead to the question of "will it be different this time?"
Market participants, who have been waiting for the Fed's interest rate hike for a year, will be focusing their attention this week at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While most strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve an increase at this meeting, futures trading points to only a 25 percent chance.
The report states that "in our research since 1950, all surplus cycles up to the present day have been in a super-upward trend cycle, with gross domestic product reaching pre-recovery peaks rapidly after the recovery begins".
Rather, it was an unprecedented slow recovery from the worst recession in a typical period.
The current cycle is the longest cycle the Fed has been waiting for since the last recession - the longest cycle on record at 35 months, and the cycle we're in is in its 74th month and still going.
With the market expecting a steady rise in interest rates, the income has become unstable and the pattern is similar to that of equities.
The difference is that when the Fed changes the course of policy, the effect is more pronounced in bonds than in stocks.
When the first rise/fall of the cycle comes, bond yields don't change direction right away.
"At the end of the interest rate-increase cycle, bond yields fall instantly", Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that interest rate increases will flatten the trend by bringing the yields between longer and shorter-term bonds closer together.
Schwab analyst Kathy Jones said that high-yield bonds generally perform better in such an environment, but "we're cautious about reaching the benchmark".
Interestingly, Jones thinks the markets are already adjusting to the Fed's policy expectations.
"In addition to a decline in dollar strength and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is regulated by tighter monetary policy", he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is flat, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tightens policy.
Broadly speaking, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from higher interest rates and more attractive local products.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt will be worse off, because the extra dollars will make their products more expensive in the global market, and their debt will be more expensive.
In a report prepared for clients by Goldman Sachs analysts, they said, "History shows that 'quality' stocks can experience underperformance at the beginning of such a rise".
The companies with strong balance sheets outperformed the ones with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percent, following increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high return on capital and low-floating equities also outperformed their low-quality rivals by an average of 4 to 3 percent.
The debt will become a big issue.
According to Goldman, companies with high volatile debt are most likely to suffer.
Aside from the pure stock market game, consumers are also expected to benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts differ in their opinions as to how quickly it can be withdrawn, savers can also benefit from higher returns.
Andrew Bingham said it was a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has accused the station of 'diminishing'
He argued that radio was becoming indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards and accused him of stealing the Brit Awards.
His agent, Damien Collins, accused The Voice of being unoriginal.
A leading proxy pressured the broadcaster to differentiate itself from other commercial stations by saying that BBC Radio 3 was gradually "turning" to Classic FM.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham told BBC bosses that the public service broadcaster was "developing into a shell" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that term, but Radio 3 has become 'old' and is turning into Classic FM".
And then, in December last year, the BBC Music Awards were also targeted.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, are another version of the Brit Awards.
Bingham said, "So if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples that come to mind, whereas you're just copying what's already on the market".
The BBC's director-general has denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is clearly ahead of its commercial rivals in both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm not going to go and learn about classical music from somewhere else.
And that's the devotion to live music, and there's nothing like making music.
He also said that he thinks that Radio 3's efforts to discover new music and promote their work is very important.
Alan Davey, director of BBC Radio 3, argued earlier this year that radio should work harder than in the past to reach a wider audience, because Britons are less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only component to be suspended as it was tailing the BBC's commercial rivals at the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee meeting.
MP Tory Damien Collins also sold The Voice - a BBC music talent competition that had been bought for £22 million by Dutch production company Talpa Media.
Can't you see why the show is making so much noise, because it's not original and it's not special?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show, which had Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made "in a style specific to the BBC".
He said he wished the agency would "find a hit of his own blood" before he ever did another entertainment program.
However, he also did not accept the idea that in the future, the production of more O Voice software would be blocked or that the money spent on licensing fees would be spent on other formats.
Is it Black Friday that saw the lowest online sales in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to be broken.
Three years ago, when mobile devices were first used for shopping, there was an explosion in online sales.
Experts say the November Black Friday may be the reason for the spending cuts.
Online shopping has been booming for over a decade, turning Britain's busiest shopping streets into ghost towns.
After figures showing that there was only a seven percent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say that internet sales are showing increasingly weak signs.
The total expenditure in August was only a five-percent increase from last year, and it was the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to be broken.
After figures showing that online sales increased by only seven percent in the first three months of 2015, experts say that online sales are showing increasingly weak signs.
Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian, "If you look at the growth rates of previous years and especially 2000 you can actually see that over time everything is returning to normal".
He added that internet sales have increased significantly since consumers started using mobile phones to buy products three years ago.
That meant more people could shop while lying on the couch.
But now it's going horizontally, you can see it going down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a term borrowed from the United States, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts say consumers may be looking forward to the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
Last year's event saw five times as many consumers as the year before, raiding corporate websites to get their hands on cheap products.
Experts say Black Friday may have "currently" put shoppers on edge, showing shoppers fighting for discounts.
A study published by the British Retailers Association found that for every £5 spent on shopping, £1 was spent on buying goods online.
One third of some products, like TVs and washing machines, are now purchased online.
And more than a quarter of people buy their clothes and shoes online instead of in the high street.
With the conviction of bin Laden's family, Muslims bid farewell to those who lost their lives in the crane accident in Mecca.
The bodies of 29 people who died in the first funerals held in Mecca were carried in the streets by Muslims.
The Saudi Arabian construction giant blamed the Saudi Binladin Group for the crane accident .
The health ministry said 394 people were injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the bodies of 29 people who died when a crane fell on the Masjid al-Haram.
The crowd, mostly white, blocked the way for the first burial to be followed by the final journey to the Mu'assim Cemetery in Mecca.
A grieving crowd has just passed the holy site of the tragic incident where a mosque roof was toppled by a crane and pilgrims were crushed to death.
The bodies of the dead were brought to be buried after the Saudi government blamed the Binladin family, who own the construction holding company, for the incident, which also injured 394 people.
The remains of 29 pilgrims who lost their lives when a crane fell into the Masjid-i Haram were carried on the shoulders along the way.
Among the dead was Kasim Akram, a father of four from the Bolton area of Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Akram came to the Masjid-i-Haram with his parents at the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi leaders announced that the Hajj would continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
In his statement today, King Salman said that the Binladin Holding Group should not leave the crane's arm open when it is idle.
The Arabic version of the decree, prepared by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, states that the Binladin Group is the only party to be charged in connection with the incident.
The English-language service of the news agency did not provide details, but the company officials were informed that the ban on traveling abroad was imposed.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find a reason why the crane toppled into the courtyard of the Masjid-i Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were coming to perform the Hajj at the end of the month.
The Binladin group has not commented on the overturned crane, and its representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of not taking up-to-date security measures and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Masjid-i-Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, many of which are maintained by the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been closely associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is the name on the front of most of the construction projects.
The last Al Qaeda leader, Osama Bin Laden, was also the son of a heretic whose adoption was denied by his family.
The accident occurred just days before millions flocked to the Hajj, a place that every adult Muslim is expected to visit at least once in their lifetime, in a season of strong wind and rain.
Authorities say 158 people are still being treated in the hospital.
Authorities have ordered compensation of 1 million riyals (174,000 pounds) to the families of the dead and to survivors with permanent disabilities.
The other wounded will get half of that amount.
The boss of B&Q says that the trend is being driven by cheap Eastern European artisans.
Veronique Laury says the British are hiring more and more masters.
The reason behind this increase is the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe.
And as a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are opening, targeting the craftsmen.
Kingfisher is also closing 60 B&Q outlets nationwide.
Written by Rupert Steiner, the Daily Mail's chief city correspondent
It is said that instead of abandoning their hammers and paintbrushes , the British began hiring skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do their chores
If you're good with a hammer or a wall paint, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, Britons are hiring more and more craftsmen to do DIY work in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, owner of the home improvement chain, said that behind this trend is the huge increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher is planning to close 60 B&Q outlets and open 200 new Screwfix stores for artisans.
Ms. Laury said she wanted to hire more women at B&Q stores because eight out of the ten purchase decisions in the store were made by women.
The staff is mostly men now.
She said that the single women's home, which has seen more home improvement than in the past, is a need to meet the emerging demographic trends.
"Our stores are still mostly man-made", said Mrs. Laury.
We need to get more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the decisions about purchased products are made by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, one of only five women to head the FTSE100, the index of Britain's leading firms, has also restructured her senior management team to include an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost alone in this field with a staff of 50 percent women, including the general manager and the chief financial officer.
"It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here", said Mrs. Laury.
It wasn't hard to find good women to get on our board.
After the group had to bear the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced a drop in both quarterly profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
The Fed is deciding on the interest rate hike.
The world is watching the two-day meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and Thursday, and it is expected to decide whether to raise interest rates after ten years.
In a Reuters poll, just over half of the 80 economists said last week that the Fed would implement this decision, but now they think it would suspend it and keep rates between 0 and 0.25 percent.
This is historic, as it's been seven years since the Fed cut rates to zero.
"For the first time", said Angel Ubide, senior research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, "we're going to see a major central bank move from zero to normalize interest rates".
The U.S. economy is doing relatively well, and in the process of revitalizing the economy, it's adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and creating a little bit of inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the less hopeful global picture.
He warned the markets against a rise, but there are signs that he believes the situation will not allow such a rise.
The verdict will be announced Thursday at 8 p.m.
The perpetrator of the Delta State University murder has left a letter of apology.
On Tuesday, authorities said Shannon Lamb left a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and "if I could take it back" after he shot and killed his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning and later that same day before he killed his co-worker.
Gautier police say Lamb, who teaches geography and social studies at Delta State University, called 911 at about 10:00 a.m.
Monday, and he said he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the officer on the phone to send a cop.
"I killed my wife last night", Lamb said, adding that he found "a sweet dog who never hurt anyone" in the house, and that he was probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he wouldn't give it.
Lamb didn't give any explanation for the murder.
When the police arrived, they found the lifeless body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn back the clock.
I loved Amy very much, and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing that note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, then killed himself after being cornered by police.
William LaForge, the university's dean, said he did not know that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "it was obvious that Lamb had something on his mind".
Despite reports Monday that Lamb believed his girlfriend Prentiss was also having an affair with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday they had "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for nearly seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good person".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but their friendship endured.
O'Steen said that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, and that she was "devastated".
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and her daughter were "definitely each other's best friends".
Linsday Knowless, whom the Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, said that Prentiss was working from his home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who has a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
"He always liked to help others", said Knowles.
Police say Lamb called his family on Monday and said he wasn't going to jail.
That night, when police approached him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped as a pedestrian, ran into the woods, and shot himself with a pistol.
According to the university's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that have lost their former charm
The actor (left) seen with his son Redmond (right) had a very stressful couple of years.
In 2001 she was stricken with leukemia, and in 2009 she lost her partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor, who also reportedly struggled with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of narcotics.
All of this has obviously done him a lot of harm.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in the Manchester United's Champions League defeat to PSV Eindhoven.
The tearful incident will keep the defender off the pitch for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal remains hopeful that Shaw can return to the field this season.
The break came after 20-year-old Shaw's reckless run-in with Hector Moreno in the 15th minute of the game, when he dropped a bomb onto the field.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and then had to be given oxygen before being sent to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He broke his leg in two places and is in hospital".
He'll be transferred today or the next day and operated on in Manchester.
It's a terrible situation - a young man transferring to Manchester at 18 years old, having a tough time, then a great game and then this.
He had an oxygen mask on his face in the locker room.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that's at least six months and you're not playing in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get a red card and a narrow penalty.
The judge, Nicola Rizzoli, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official had made a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible fight with two legs.
Shaw's tweet read: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how disappointed I am, my recovery is just beginning, I will return stronger".
Related: Luke Shaw is reeling from the shock of his injury in the PSV defeat to Manchester United.
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be a morale booster for the English defender.
PSV technical director Phillip Cocu said: "It was a very bad injury".
If this kind of injury happens to any player, it's going to hurt everybody.
Our players never intend to harm their opponent.
He also suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Cocu said he finds it very difficult because he never intended to injure his opponent and after hearing that it was a very bad fracture, it was not good.
I couldn't see that moment from my side.
All I could see was the ball going the other way, like Moreno touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's touch.
Moreno, in his SBS 6 interview, said, "I know what it feels like, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel terrible about it and I'm sorry.
He was hospitalized after a fight with Chris Smalling at Andrés Guardado of PSV.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better than that?
That's something every parent learns quickly: When your child loves a book, you know it won't take long to learn it almost by heart.
Apparently, if you're not David Cameron.
When asked by a supplier of childcare vacation programming what her favorite children's book was, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss's 1971 environmental fairy tale.
In a post on the website of his company SuperCamps, Cameron said that it was a difficult decision, adding: "I love reading this book to my children because it has a funny, moving, creative and powerful message, and an image or message that we always skip in the content".
And it was going pretty well until this paragraph, where Cameron supposedly wrote about the book's content, but actually added new characters and details to inflate the content of the original fairy tale text, which summarizes the 2012 film version of the book.
In Thneed-Ville, a walled city where all nature is gone, where even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted seeks to fulfill his dream of seeing a real tree in order to win the heart of his dream girl, Audrey, and he introduces a love story that Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, never knew existed.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough to you, the text Cameron is addressing is very similar in some ways to the Internet Movie Archive's short summary of The Lora, which begins: "In Thneedville, the walled city where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted seeks to win the heart of the girl of his dreams, Audrey".
Given his claims to be a conscientious parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron is unaware of the book's main plot, in which he hears about how an unnamed young boy has been destroyed by greedy, tree-cutting, swarm-rearing Once, despite the objections of the local environment, the beak-whiskered creature who gave the book its name, the Lorax.
Probably a weak PR job, passed on to a servant who apparently hasn't read The Lorax to a kid 20 times in a row.
A spokeswoman for the president said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided by Cameron's staff, but otherwise, no comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of being ousted by the British, but he was still intact.
Playing Pakistan in the UAE is a tough task, but after seeing the British team selected for the tour, I don't think there's a repeat of last year's 3-0 Test series defeat on the cards.
I'm not ruling out a move win, though.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but they have good running backs on the batting line and a strong collective sense of the game, which doesn't heal the wounds of 2012, but only provides a little youthful optimism.
In the aggregate, Moeen Ali is developing as a game-changer and Adil Rashid represents an attacking option, although his quality is unknown at the Test level.
Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England Test squad and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to remove Adam Lyth is a difficult one for me to analyse as head coach at Yorkshire.
Seven tries against two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the simple but inescapable truth is that cricketers are judged by the outcome.
For example, there were no question marks on Joe Root, and it had to be announced because -- as I said before -- the players were their best choices.
After a few 50-issue series, Lyth could have seen his career stretch, but he chose his own destiny.
I hope you'll take another chance if you work harder for Yorkshire.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, even though he wasn't performing at his best, which didn't surprise me; he's a team man first and foremost.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it will take a Test batsman to get his grade.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - took seven caps, Nick Compton on the other hand took nine.
Only Compton got a chance to get a rematch.
The only pain you can feel for Jonathan Trott is that England may have gone to the Caribbean first - with Lyth's form at its peak - but this wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming in, and he's a high-level hitter in my book.
He's an X-factor cricketer, and we saw that when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge earlier this season, in Yorkshire.
He should be able to at least get the same opportunity as before, but that depends on the team composition in the UAE.
The idea of Moeen opening the batting with Cook to get an extra game-winner while holding four quick worked, and I'm not opposed to it.
I don't understand why a batsman can't score here, and this left-hander has already shown how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen might not have done his job for the city of Worcestershire, but he's seen a three for them and it doesn't make much of a difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests before his first fall out in 2001.
He grabbed the three hundred and never looked back.
Zafar Ansari is coming in as a backup playmaker and in my limited interactions with him, he has surprised me as an impressive young man.
People can look at the raw stats -- 31 average at bats and 35 average at bat -- and think that's a stretch, but there aren't many game-changers who raise their hands, and the player selections are made in favor of being young.
He's gonna learn a lot this tour.
Away from the team, England seem to have made some cunning additions to their coaching staff.
The appointment of Sri Lanka's Mahela Jayawardene as a Test match advisor may be a clever move.
He's one of the most beloved men in the game, and he'll bring with him a wealth of experience, against all odds and all odds.
Paul Collingwood is coming off the tour for the white ball and he's bringing both energy and ruthlessness to the game.
I always thought he was born for the world of international cricket, whether he's a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has a sense of direction.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even messages that were said before, can bring a new twist to the team.
Colly's Durham teammate Ben Stokes is resting for a day's play, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Not everyone agrees, but it's not the plans, coaches and players that are making it.
And you must remember that, like the players, their work is dependent on the results.
Decisions like this are never easy to make.
Brexit camp could win if economy stays in recession until 2017
David Cameron's half-baked re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse by the day, and this is despite Jeremy "Yes or No?" Corbyn's election as Labour leader or the TUC's outburst on Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat colleague of mine said that some member states are tired of the EU, which is mired in all sorts of crises, most of which they don't want, and Britain's agenda of divisive privileges and disruptive treaty changes that only concern itself with itself.
The TUC decided at their annual meeting in Brighton that they didn't want them if it would hurt social security.
Or we could call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take portraits of themselves in front of famous monuments, whether they are prominent or not, and then return to their countries to say that they are gathering allies for reform.
This is all about me.
As Berlin says, "Don't leave us alone with France", my European friend who wants an outward-facing Britain in the EU tent points out that it's getting to the point where increasingly short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals no longer care whether we stick with the model.
Germany's prudent and sober Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, yet she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave power before things get worse, as in the case of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces re-election or a change of power in France in 2017.
He's a dying force.
Soon, a right-wing nationalist government will be in power in Poland, and a left-wing government in Spain.
For the Selfie Britons, who must use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, it's unlikely that these countries will show any effort, because they don't want to, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers, in the style of the Scottish National Party, may be planning to accelerate Brexit by making deliberate statements that will not help the situation during the UK's 2017 referendum campaign, my friend says.
"There was no renegotiation", and "Britain had nothing to gain from renegotiation".
Europeans know from their previous experience how anti-EU the exploitative, oligarchic media barons of Fleet Street were, because they weren't like that in the time of Tony Benn, who inspired the 1975 referendum which approved our entry in 1973 by a two-to-one margin.
That's how they remember Boris Johnson, the leading Euro-opportunist, who was a Brussels correspondent in the early '90s, and who was known as "the EU's banana".
All their stupidity aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were tax-dealers, illegal wiretappers, and so-called outsiders who own most of our major newspapers.
And Tony Blair thought much the same thing about them, except that when he was trapped in a cage with a horny gorilla, he knew that he had to distract him by giving him bananas at lunch and then at tea time so that he wouldn't be a target.
In fact, Miliband was more Blair than Blair in opposing Cameron's brilliant idea of a referendum, because Blair had waived the principle on the EU constitution, which was repealed in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who had given him the exit card.
The press never forgave him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - and I told him he had no time to waste on me - seems in danger of re-adopting the Murdoch boycott strategy of the 1980s, which was a mistake then and now.
It's going to take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with Andrew Marr, who left his BBC chair on Sunday, not with me, and certainly not with the media.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is being politely described as evolving.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most people outside of the hostile Ukip trend and the ardent supporters of Conservative Little England say yes to that.
After all, "Benn but not Bennite" is what Hilary Benn said on radio and TV this week, as she naively forced herself to not accept that Corbyn's appointment of John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of his father's struggle with infidelity in the 1970s on television to his colleagues in the labor cabinet, not going too far and losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more exciting.
But in the words of "Benn" - "to fight to stay at all costs" - that was not what McDonnell said, nor what JC said to the Lords in the private meeting on Monday night.
And considering that it's also me, whatever the detail that Corbyn is trying to convey, whatever the image that he's trying to convey, in the 24/7 TV age, and especially in the social media vortex that is a bed of paranoia and betrayal, message discipline continues to retain its importance.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to challenge Cameron on Europe, which would guarantee Labour's support in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks that way.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's shift to Bennite lock-in economics and anti-capitalist past over EU membership is no longer just a particular debate among left-wing opponents, whose doctrinal quibbling of narcissism of minor differences is one of their cornerstones.
As with his negotiations with NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for a withdrawal - foreign diplomats will have to try to make sense of them for their masters in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin lose political capital in terms of concessions to Britain, when they themselves have a skeptical electorate?
As I was told at the opening of the British National Security Forum on Monday, the US is already very disappointed by the poor performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-cutting Conservative Party government in power.
Experts are critical of the UK Public Health e-cigarette research
Researchers at a 12-person meeting of tobacco industry-connected people at a government-funded agency claimed that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released its "turning point" report last month, which it described as "a detailed examination of the evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the soundness of the data, pointing to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month's editor of the medical journal Lancet targeted the "extraordinarily rotten foundation" based on the PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers, writing in the BMJ, questioned whether the claims were "built on sand or rock".
Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said they would expect PHE's claim that "e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking by the current best estimate" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is the result of a meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to synthesize their views on the harms of various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
They also said that in a sustainability report, he endorsed the BAT's public health promotion document.
They added that one of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but that this was not previously reported funding from the cigarette company Philip Morris International.
No details were given on how the panel members were selected, but they included some well-known e-cigarette giants, some of whom reported their industry background in the article.
Some of the other people who were present at the meeting were not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of tobacco at PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group conceded that the research paper "effectively" lacked "concrete evidence about the harms of most products by many criteria".
But none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that claims that "there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are a switch to smoking for children or non-smokers" are too premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and welfare at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had already been answered.
He said, "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking".
One out of every two people who has smoked cigarettes their whole lives dies from the addiction.
All the evidence points to the fact that the health risks of e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear mission: to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it doesn't show, especially in a time when there is so much confusion about the harms of tobacco compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
We are fulfilling our national responsibility by making clear the evidence we have - that e-cigarettes, while not risk-free, do only carry a small fraction of the harm caused by smoking.
The former Channel 4 boss said the BBC should drop EastEnders.
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, and noted that advertising rivals could "give their right arm" for hit shows such as the Albert Square series.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to make programmes of the kind that were not made by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes that were likely to be watched by a smaller audience, such as BBC4, on channels that had the highest ratings at precious intervals, as opposed to the highest-rated programmes of their rivals.
After the BBC's director-general Tony Hall said the organisation wanted to work more with other organisations; Johnson said it had been tried unsuccessfully for six years during his time at Channel 4 to establish a link with the BBC.
During a question on the future of the BBC, Johnson told the House of Lords communications committee, "I am struggling with the idea that the BBC should order and broadcast programmes which can be shown by competitors without open subsidy".
If you continue to apply the licensing fee, which I'm not sure is a good idea in the medium or long term, the output should at least be reduced to programs that others have not made or ordered.
They're broadcasting The Voice in primetime because they want to get as much support as possible for my future.
The basic idea here is that no one else is going to publish it, which is ridiculous and frankly absurd.
Johnson said, "I don't see why programs that can be funded without aid should be funded with a tax at a reduced rate.
One is The Voice, and the other is EastEnders, and it's actually done internally.
To be honest, the other channels are giving their right arm for this.
I'm trying to see how public service broadcasts are.
I don't think it's going to do the BBC any harm.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of pursuing ratings "out of the passion of the people who work here and because those people saw this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support".
His comments about the BBC's most popular programmes echo those of Tony Ball, the previous Sky executive, who used MacTaggart's lesson in Edinburgh in 2003 to propose that the BBC sell programmes such as EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes went to BBC4 and that viewership measurement could not be done here but that they were being paid tax breaks and could continue to argue for their pseudo-religious duties in providing £4 billion in licence fee revenue, adding: "And we are of course doing all these slick programmes that nobody watches".
They put them in the gaps where no one will ever see them.
On the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system in terms of who benefits from it the most.
Of course you all think, we all think, £150 a year is a great value, but I wonder if the reason people do this is because they don't watch too much BBC.
Also presenting evidence to the committee on Tuesday, former Sky and Channel 5 executive David Elstein said the BBC should revise its Reithian mission of "informing, educating and entertaining".
He said that some of the BBC's output was now officially classified as education - that was 1% of TV output and 0.1% of radio - and that public service broadcasting in Australia and Canada should be at the forefront of this and that this should be changed to "information, enlightenment and education".
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about only a handful of proms shown on TV and partner with advertisers to ensure all of them are seen online.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how the rope worms change direction as they are hit by the sound vibrations.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
Tiny threadworms change direction when they're hit by sound vibrations at speeds humans can't hear.
The vibrations are triggered by the activation of motor neuron cells, which have been genetically modified to carry out the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms proved the power of a new procedure called sonogenetics, which allows ultrasound to be used to activate a number of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep-brain stimulation, an interventional procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
The worms are usually not responsive to the sounds of the world, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles, they reacted.
The bubbles he found amplify the ultrasound waves, allowing the worms to pass through.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect structures called TRP-4 ion channels, which are found in the membranes of some worm cells.
According to a report in Nature Communications, sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they connect to.
To create ultrasound-controlled threadworms, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons could carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applied ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves were amplified by the micro-shells and transmitted into the worms, where the altered motor neurons were activated.
This procedure has similarities to optogenetics, a breakthrough tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent through an optical fiber to a desired point in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unimpeded and thus be sent through the skull into the brain.
Chalasani said "we believe that by using gene therapy and a curative virus, human neurons targeted in the clinical setting for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to ultrasound signals".
He added that other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
The ads denounce the UK's arms trade.
Watch the video of the Amnesty International's anti-gun fair.
The dreaded killer drones!
The cuffs that broke your ankle!
Particle-activated bombs!
And the electric shock shots that cause severe pain but leave no marks!
The thin sound and cartoon images produced for Amnesty International at the British government's ExCel Centre in London Docks, designed to highlight the desire to sell arms to oppressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International, leave no doubt that the world's largest arms show is a cutthroat hoax.

But a different campaign is going on with posters at bus stops and subway stations and it requires a double look.
In one, he uses the London Underground fonts and branding to turn the DLR line into a tank and says, "Important announcement, will you be traveling on the DLR between September 15th and 18th?"
This September, a gang of arms dealers will attack the DLR... and customers are asked to help stop this arms show.
300 posters from artists who exhibited at the Museum of Cruel Design in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collective called the Patrol Group helped distribute it using "Private Area Advertising Packages" which cost £6 and which claimed to "grant access to about a third of the bus stop advertising space on the planet".
Transport for London was not pleased with this poster "vandalism".
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of cruel designs and a faculty member at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical by the day, and they're looking for ways to bring political issues to audiences outside of the galleries.
Many artists are joining activists in protest movements and are beginning to realize that in order for their art to have an impact on society, they need to go out into the real world.
Another anti-gun poster is also appearing on the subway for travelers.
The video by Amnesty International was viewed over 100,000 times on Facebook in 24 hours, and was created by the free advertising agency VCCP, who also provided a graphic designer and sound artist for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was so surprised by the silence against gun show ads -- with blank space on the ExCel calendar -- that he thought, "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to escape".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic, cunning corporate advertisement, but "they embellished it with bright colors and animation, making it more eye-catching".
Tom Davies from the organisation Af said: "They have been very helpful to us in creating concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the Fuarda".
What we need now is for the British government to act to stop the illegal sale of torture equipment on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art at the gun fair comes from inside the ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab revealed the US military ordered "AT4CS RS launched from our shoulder".
Inside is "a unique-shaped warhead that delivers a powerful blow through the armour".
Whatever he's doing, it's not going to be pretty.
The eight golden rules of living in a student residence
It's been 11 years since I moved into a dorm room as a 19-year-old with no interest, and I still believe in rats and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of my annoying ones - and the countless long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled into eight golden rules.
Moving into a home can range from frustrating to downright terrifying.
The seductiveness of the chatter: people asking where you're from, whether you've lost years, where you insist on Corbyn and why you "obviously don't love or hate Marmite because really guys it's just a yeast extract HAHAHAH I'll be in my room".
Take a breath.
And let the others have one -- ask questions and show concern.
It'll guide the conversation and help you separate the people you like from the people you won't talk to even if your eyelashes are inflamed and they're wearing fire extinguisher.
Give the people some room.
People's rooms are often turned into drinks receptions, movie night venues, and social hang-ins, but they're also places where people dress and adjust their underwear.

Introverts get rough with the university.
Your room may be a secluded space, but many dorm hallways foster a culture of room-to-room hanging, and it's friendly, social, and open to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
There's nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I like you and I want to keep our friendship, but I need you to go away for a while so I can replace the energy I've wasted communicating with you".
Try to sense that a friend is tired of socializing and perhaps send a text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
A fellow student in the dorm had a policy that if the door was unlocked, he was invited in.
He's seen a lot.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Since you started college in the height of the cooking competition craze, it's less weird to knock on people's doors with a plate of brownie and introduce yourself, and less 1950s "welcome to our district, I cooked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions".
Offering people homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your housemates will feel compelled to talk, and perhaps associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Well, it's about you being a good cook.
A well-mixed lump of dough, sugar and butter, which will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Obviously, it's stealing to scratch someone's chicken, but stealing to get a few drops of milk for your tea?

It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal your stuff, and I understand you-- but try to handle this in a more mature way than my compatriot, who used liquid soap to punish the person who stole your milk.
He's in prison now.
Don't make noise that will keep people from sleeping or studying.
It's not just being a decent person, but because you're the ones in the glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her next door neighbor to turn down the drums because it's 3:00 in the morning and she has a morning test.
The answer was to open up the sound.
When they finally closed at 5 a.m., she gently let them sleep for two hours before going to her own three-hour test, opening her music to the last sound and locking the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future wife moved into the same hallway as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird to misunderstand a fellow hallway associate as your future wife, and hang out, and break up, and have to see him every day and watch your common friends get captured?
Of course, that's a good idea, but if your hot-ass neighbor is not your future wife, at least talk to her and give her some common sense.
When you're having a good time and you notice that someone left their keys unlocked, know that the line between joking and bullying is a little bit thinner than you think.

Her heart stopped while she was getting pretty
REU DE JANEIRO - Raquel Santos, 28, a mother of two, went to her cosmetologist on Monday to have the marks of laughter on the sides of her mouth removed.
The woman who was injected with filler in her face soon had a rapid heartbeat and breathing.
He died of a cardiac arrest.
Police are investigating whether the drug Potena, which she took daily, may have played a role in her death.
The actual cause of death will be determined after the autopsy.
One of the model's closest friends, Debora Azevedo, told Brazilian media that Santos, who has two sons, one aged 7 and the other 13, is obsessed with cosmetic surgery.

The oil companies are officially bankrupt.
Since 2014, when oil prices started to fall, the most profound deepwater oil exploration projects have been suspended, while about $400 billion in investment has been delayed until the end of last year.
According to research by the consulting firm Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have caused the suspension of $380 billion in oil and gas exploration/production projects, while suspending production of millions of barrels across a wide geography from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa.
The biggest reason for the cost cuts is the statement "Company budgets have shrunk dramatically", which shows oil prices dropping by 70 percent in a year and a half to a 12-year low from a high of $115 in the summer of 2014.
$ 400 billion in debt .
Crude oil prices have been surprisingly low for the last 12 years, dropping below $30.
"Will oil fall to 15 dollars?" "Is oil cheaper than water?" The industry is being affected by the falling prices, according to a study published by Wood Mackenzie, an energy consultancy, in the midst of heated debate.
Wood Mackenzie, whose latest report in July revealed that falling oil prices had caused 46 major energy investments to be suspended, totalling $200 billion, reveals in his new research where that figure stood by the end of 2015.
According to this, 22 major projects were postponed in the last six months of 2015, while 68 major projects were suspended since the oil crisis started in 2014.
And these projects are worth about 400 billion dollars.
2.9 million barrels a day
The study, which highlights the impact of low oil prices on corporate plans as "merciless", notes that deep-sea development projects are the most affected.
The projects that have been suspended represent a total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalent in reserves, which means that daily production of 2.9 million barrels of oil has been postponed until 2025.
According to the study, the final investment decision for most of these projects was postponed to 2017 and beyond, while the initial production targets were shifted to between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 projects that have been delayed, the report highlights "the majority of the $170 billion in potential investment expected to be made in the next five years" in deep-sea projects.
That's because the upfront cost is so high.
"70 percent of the deep-sea spending is accounted for by Nigeria, Angola, and the U.S.'s oil-intensive projects in the Gulf of Mexico", says the report.
According to the study, the countries with the most delayed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.
The countries with the largest deposits of gas are Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia, which together account for 85 percent of the total.
While much of the natural gas waiting to be released is in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions, such as building a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
The companies most at risk are the oil giants with deep-sea, Canadian oil sands and successive commitments in the Caspian, and the companies are trying to adapt to the scenario of "even lower" oil prices.
The eyes in Iran
Not so long ago, about four years ago, there was a picture of the United States and Europe embargoing Iranian oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, at about $110 a barrel, and discussing how to keep Iran's oil exports down without causing a sudden spike in prices.
This week, we're looking at a completely different scenario.
Oil prices have fallen below $30 for the first time since 2004, largely due to a boom in U.S. production and the lifting of sanctions on Iran.
That's why the eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, it will add more oil to the already saturated oil market.
This could cause prices to fall below the levels that surprised us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to give Iran market share, will pump more oil and there may be a price war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
As soon as the sanctions are lifted, Iran's main target is said to be Asia's fast-growing oil market India and its old partners in Europe.
Iranian officials have previously said that they aim to increase exports by 500,000 barrels per day in the first phase and then release another equivalent amount later.
According to Reuters map information, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCC) are waiting off the Iranian coast, at least 13 of them fully or in large quantities.
Iran has the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to sanction exemptions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Before the sanctions, Iran's oil exports were up to 3 million barrels a day.
Aysun Göksu, a securities research expert, answers the question of whether oil will fall below $ 20: "China-centered global growth concerns increase downward pressure on commodity prices, causing the deepening of the loss in oil prices".
In China, the world's largest oil importer, we see oil losses reaching 20 percent since the beginning of the year, in parallel with the economic slowdown, with concerns that oil demand will decline.
Additionally, the global appreciation of the dollar and the global glut of supply could see oil prices falling below $30 in the coming days.
Unless we see a sustained price increase above the $32 to $33 levels, the upward movement in oil could be limited and downward pressure could increase.
At this point, it could be argued that closing below the critical $30 level is key to the continued decline.
So it's not surprising that we're seeing some loosening up the bottom to the 23.30-25.60 support zone.
Isham Sardouk: 'The age of the angel is over!'
Why did you turn to Turkey when you were doing trend-setting for Victoria's Secret and WGSN, the fashion network of the world?
- I'm always for change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I've held important positions there.
Meanwhile, I've been advising Koton for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and in the Coton brand.
I realized that in the age of globalization, you have everything you need to be a chain store.
And now I'm here to make it happen.
Can you do it in a short time?
- I certainly do.
It's a young brand, but it's already sold in 50 countries.
We put out 50 collections a year, 15 separate issues.
So it's got everything a chain store should have.
We can cater to the needs of consumers in different geographies from Dubai to Moscow.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, and it's the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Is it necessary to open a shop in Paris?
- I know.
It's not because Europe's economy is great.
But you open some stores for the image.
You'll have a shop in the fashion capitals of Paris, London, you'll make money in the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both of which are essential for a brand that plays globally.
So let's talk about the trends.
- It's a very romantic, elegant season.
The flying chiffon dresses, the soft tones, the pinks, the whites, the reds.
The patterns...
We're going through very difficult and brutal times, and the fashion world is always trying to bring a little happiness to life in these difficult times by bringing stylish, heartwarming designs to the podium.
That's what we do.
So the "golden age" is back for the new season.
Let's go back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about her great physique, she's so positive, she's such a good girl.
He'd sit by me when I was working, and he'd feed me apples and stuff, and he'd say, "Honey, are you hungry?"
I mean, she was so cute.
You know what I'm talking about, I did some research, and you've interviewed every Victoria's Secret model.
How beautiful was Karolina?
But Adriana Lima was also very impressive in her beauty.
- Oh, yeah, that's the voice!
That speech, that tone...
You're gonna pull the guy back after a while, and you're gonna say, "Sit on the sidelines and look pretty, and do nothing else!"
It's annoying.
Right, that's what shocks are.
I did an interview with Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified by her lack of intelligence.
- Most of them are.
The new angels are not the same as before...
I remember Gisele's time, and...
It was a little difficult to work with, though.
He came in the back, smoking like a chimney.
It's not because it's Tiryaki.
Nobody can drink, only he can drink!
The goal is to be a diva.
The Victoria's Secret fashion show, which aired two months ago, has the lowest ratings in history.
Why do you think?
- Like I said, the age of the fairy-tale angels is over.
I'm sorry, but who should Gigi Hadid be?
What's so great about it?
Kendall Jenner, for example, is like a wooden...
I don't have a curve, I don't have anything.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's become the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yes, but what a beautiful face.
I'd like to exercise my right to object.
I interviewed her last year, and she was pretty down...
- All the smoking, the drinking, now it's ugly.
But she had such a beautiful face in the nineties.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
She was at the end of her supermodel days.
I mean, you know, the days of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my next-door neighbor, and I saw her without makeup every morning.
Such a pose is not beauty, such a grace.
What about Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
It's not every campaign.
People are getting tired.
There's no shortage of famous models and celebrities, as there used to be.
People want to see the real faces of their own in campaigns.
We're going to go after it.
Because it's the trend.
Letter from 25 writers to Turkey
According to BBC Turkish, writers, including the presidents of the International Writers Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, said that threats and physical attacks against their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
The letter also listed two attacks targeting the Hürriyet newspaper in Turkey, the Koza group raid and the detention of Vice News reporters, as well as investigations and arrests of journalists as among the worrying developments.
Mommy's half-time job has sparked controversy
Turkish-İş "We think that mothers are given half-working rights so that the hired labor can be brought back".
"We are concerned that this arrangement in favor of women will prevent women from working", TISK said.
The new rights that are planned to be introduced to civil servants and female employees after childbirth or adoption, passed through the commission with all-day talks.
The issue of "wage labour" was the most frequently raised in the commission hearings of the regulations that provide for part-time work or unpaid leave for 6 months after birth, and part-time work until the child goes to primary school.
CHP MP Musa Çam said that it is right to have children working part-time until they go to primary school, but there are some concerns, "If you bring the regulation of hired labor after this, we will be against it until the end".
Enis Bagdadioglu, who participated in the commission's meetings on behalf of Türk-İş, expressed similar concerns and said, "We have doubts about how to fill the place of the part-time female worker".
He said that if the issue of hiring workers is brought up again, new problems will arise that will go beyond the issue of contract work. "We will therefore monitor with concern the developments regarding private employment offices", he said.
TİSK Secretary-General Bülent Pirler said that the law introduced part-time work for 5 years, adding that "there is no such long-term part-time work in other countries".
Here's the thing.
"Where there are one or two employees, you have to think about the consequences of this practice", he said.
TOBB Advisor Ahmet Şağar said that if the application is implemented, it will be difficult to find workers.
Saying that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, Şağar said, "If there is a regulation on special employment bureaus, there should be an agreement between the worker and the employer".
Metin Feyzioğlu: We are not supporting it
Feyzioğlu's explanation is: "We do not participate in this meeting, it is not possible for us to participate and support it".
Because there is no one-sentence criticism of the PKK.
You couldn't say a negative word against the PKK, the separatist terrorist organization, and you didn't dust it off.
We don't take seriously and find no sincerity in the heavy statements that are made only and solely against the state, taking into account those who make them.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If the representatives of the state, public officials, security forces are acting unlawfully in this context, we will follow them.
When we say "Don't destroy the state", they attack us as "divisive, fascist".
When we say, "This state must act according to the law, it must always put the law above the law", they say, "You are creating division".
We are the bridge.
We are the people who are always obliged to tell the truth.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, whose real name is Belgin Sarılmışer, was born on 16 July 1960 in Mersin.
With her parents' divorce, she moved to Ankara with her mother Sebahat Çakır in 1966.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, he entered the Piano department of the Ankara State Conservatory but left due to financial difficulties and worked for a while in PTT, having grown up.
In 1979, he accepted a job offer after performing at the Feyman Nightclub, where he had gone to party with friends.
Feyman performed with the Lokomotif orchestra at the Feyman Night Club with repertoire consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and instruments that were fashionable at the time.
After Ankara, Bergen went to Adana for work, where she met Halis Serbes and married him a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longplay from Atlas Records, "I Have a Complaint".
Bergen, who could not stand the violence of her husband while continuing her career in the art world, fled her husband many times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, she was falsely accused of sexual harassment by her husband.
Bergen, who lost one eye and was burned most of his body, was persuaded to perform by Cengiz Özşeker, the composer of the song "Kimbilir?" that made Kibariye famous.
The artist, who performed at İzmir Pırlanta Pavyon, which was owned by Özşeker until 1985, prepared a demo tape called "Kardeşiz Kader" with his boss and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist who released "İnsan Severse", the first professional longplay in the music market of Istanbul, under the musical direction of Burhan Bayar, gained fame with "Acıların Kadini" towards the end of 1986.
The album was very well received and in April 1987 she was awarded by the record company with the title "The Most Satan Arabesk Female Artist of the Album of 1986" with the Golden Record and Golden Cassette.
In the same year, she appeared in the film "The Woman of Sorrows" with Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan and Meral Niron.
Bergen, who has a large fan base, narrowly escaped a knife attack in Adana, where he was attending a concert.
The artist, who left the stage for a period, released the albums "Onu da Yak Tanrım", "Sevgimin Bedeli" and "İstemiyorum" under the direction of great masters Selami Şahin, Özer Şenay and Cengiz Tekin, respectively.
Bergen, who officially divorced her husband in April 1989, made her return to the stage in June 1989 with her last album in her lifetime, Years Without Forgiveness.
The artist, who started the promotional tour of the album, which was met with intense attention, was shot and killed by his wife in Adana Pozantı on the night of August 14, 1989.
His homeland was buried in Mersin.
Bergen has had five long plays and 11 cassettes in his short 29 years, with 129 songs and a video film.
The claims of the legendary artist who signed the arabesque with a different and powerful voice, gained truth with the first day of the "Giden Gençliğim" album released after his death.
Officially released studio albums by Bergen:
1982 - I have a complaint LP (reissued as MC in 1986).
1983 - Brotherhood of Fate LP (reissued as MC in 1985 and 1990.)

Nazım Hikmet was commemorated on her 114th birthday
Nazım Hikmet Ran, known as the national poet, was commemorated on his 114th birthday with the "İyi ki Doğdun Nazım" event.
The event was organized by the Municipality of Konak and took place in the hall named after the poet in the Cultural Center of Güzelyalı.
The event was made with poetry and music recordings and the poems of the famous poet were sung by the theater and cinema actor Rüştü Asyalı.
The event was also accompanied by the Three Anatolian Music Societies with their interpretations.
Nazım Hikmet was accompanied by many art lovers.
These names included Ali Seçkiner Alıcı, Erkoç Torun, Nedim Yıldız and Zeynep Göknur Yıldız and Ziya Özsökmenler.
In Istanbul, the event was organized by the Nazım Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
The Foundation's President Rutkay Aziz and members, the daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter of Nazim Hikmet's wife Vera Tulyakova, actress Tarık Akan gathered in Tarabya for the event.
"Living alone and free as a tree / And to his sister as a forest" is the motto of the poem, and the sea leaves the carnations.
The event, which was organized with the contribution of the Sarıyer Municipality, will be accompanied by the songs of the Nâzım Hikmet Korosu.
Nazım Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of world-renowned poet Nazım Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He was repeatedly arrested for his political views and spent much of his adult life in prison or in exile.
Her poetry has been translated into more than fifty languages and her work has received numerous awards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
Bursa Nilüfer Municipality has held a special celebration for the 114th birthday of world-renowned poet Nazım Hikmet.
The municipality, which has been working on the documentary "Bursa's Nazımı" about Nazım's 11 years in Bursa Prison, also issued a personal stamp for the poet for the first time in Turkish history.
Thus, the first personal stamp in the name of Nazım Hikmet was issued in the history of Turkey with the cooperation of PTT.
This special stamp and envelopes for the first day, which cost 1.40 TL, will be presented to guests at the night to be held on Thursday, January 14 at the Nazım Hikmet Cultural Center.
They'll be deported by bicycle.
But since the two countries have not reached an agreement, the refugees, most of them Syrians, will have to pedal back to Russia, this time at minus 20 degrees.
In the summer, because it was safer and cheaper, a group of refugees took a plane to Russia, and from there they went north through Murmansk to Norway.
Since the agreement between the two countries did not allow the crossing on foot, the migrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
So the Norwegian security ordered that the abandoned bikes be repaired after crossing the border.
Crisis of "€3 billion to Turkey" in EU
The crisis over the €3 billion pledged to Turkey for refugees continues.
European Union Commission President Jean Claude Juncker has criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi for blocking funds to be transferred to Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe was not good, Juncker said, underlining that the EU had to find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey, it's for Syrian refugees in Turkey".
We're not even three billion yet.
"This is a matter of EU credibility, and therefore important", he said.
Juncker said he expected the money to be ready by the previously given date of 26 January.
Italy is among the countries that have been noted for their positive attitude towards Turkey.
Diplomatic sources believe that Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey and is linked to the problems experienced between Italy and the EU Commission and some countries of the Union.
There's been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
Renzi continued to harshly criticize German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU during and after the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants.
At yesterday's press conference, Juncker, who criticized Renzi's attitude, said that "Renzi should stop blaming the EU".
"It's wrong that Renzi, whom I love very much, insults the EU Commission at every opportunity", he said.
Juncker implied that Renzi was playing the inside.
Of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey, 1 billion will be financed from the EU budget.
The other 2 billion will come from the budgets of the member countries.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
The Greek Government, which announced that it would not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, decided to transfer its share of 2.3 million euros to the EU budget to be used for supporting Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is expected to be used in the 2016-2017 period.
I cried when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon.
Abdullah Kurdi, the father, reacted strongly to the cartoon, telling the official Sputnik news agency, "I cried for this cartoon, if you want to know the truth".
"I felt so bad", she said.
Father Kurdi, who expressed positive expectations of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, said:
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
This cartoon made everyone very sad.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and he's dead.
Aylan, me and my family should have been respected by Charlie Hebdo, but it was the other way around.
This magazine should honor the dead.
They published a disrespectful cartoon about our Lord.
They even published articles on Allah.
It's a small thing to do to my child in the sight of God and the Prophet.
Kurdi, who lives in Erbil, made the following appeal: "I appeal to the whole world and to the humorous magazine, everyone should respect all the children who died".
You shouldn't upset their families, you shouldn't add to their pain.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was also among those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, in the signed cartoon, suggests that Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian who threw his lifeless body on the beach of Bodrum, might grow up to be one of the 'abusers in Germany'.
French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which was attacked last year by radical religious extremists for publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad, has again become the focus of controversy over its caricature of Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicts a harasser who chases women with a pig face and calls out to immigrants, as in the case of the harassment of women during the New Year celebrations, mainly in the German city of Cologne.
The cartoon, which has caused a mixed reaction on social media, is actually part of a four-column frame.
The column reads "France is not this" and many readers have criticized the growing hostility to refugees along with other values that have been lost to France.
On the other hand, the cartoon still caused many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
Charlie Hebdo magazine, in an issue last year, praised Germany for accepting 800,000 refugees, while criticizing France's reluctance to open its doors to migrants.
The cartoon said, "He was too close to his goal", while the billboard said, "Two kids' menus for one price".
'The German victims of Sultanahmet are being autopsied in Germany'
According to the news on the website of the weekly Der Spiegel, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office decided to bring the bodies of 10 people who lost their lives in the attack to Germany.
The bodies of the dead will be flown by a German Air Force plane to the country today or tomorrow and will be received at the airport with a ceremony.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission, which is affiliated with the Federal Criminal Office (BKA), which carries out forensic procedures, travel to the countries where the accident or attack occurred, identifying and performing autopsies on German citizens who died in normal circumstances.
But Der Spiegel magazine said that this time it would be different.
According to the magazine, officials from the Federal Criminal Office asked the Turkish authorities to identify the deceased and to perform an autopsy in Istanbul, but the Turkish authorities did not accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being treated in hospital.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has lost her life
A noted political theorist and socialist historian, Meiksins Wood was particularly remembered for his important work on the origins of capitalism.
The following works by Meiksins Wood, a Latvian born in New York in 1942, have also been published in Turkish: Escape from the Classroom -- The Archaic Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism vs. Democracy -- The Origins of Capitalism -- The Empire of Capital -- Return to Marx
Swimming pool for refugees is prohibited
The German press reported that the city would lift the ban if the social workers in the hostel reported that the message of the ban was understood by the asylum seekers.
Social worker Markus Schnapka, who stated that the municipality did not want to punish the innocent for the behavior of a few people, told WDR that they informed the residents in the dormitories about the values that are important in Germany in three languages.
Schnapka noted that they did not discuss the value of gender equality, which Germany values, and added that the municipality would punish any kind of attack and harassment.
On the other hand, the carnival parade in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of the Cologne harassment scandals being repeated on the upcoming carnival parade.
The city has announced that the carnival parade is cancelled because there is no guarantee that there will be no harassment.
What are the benefits of steaming?
Steaming, a technique that doesn't kill the vitamins and minerals in the food, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steam cooking, one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East, has been known to boost metabolism and facilitate digestion.
It completely eliminates the problems of indigestion and the bacteria and germs in the food.
The protein, cellulose, and starch in the food are completely dissolved by this technique, making the food softer.
Cooking in low-pressure steam is done in a pot with the help of steam vessels or steam machines.
High pressure cooking requires less water and less cooking time.
The best example of this is cooking in a frying pan.
Especially in the case of foods such as vegetables on diet menus, vegetables must be washed thoroughly and then put into the filter and wait for the filter to filter.
A deep pot is filled with one-third water and a steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The mouth of the pot is left half-closed.
This allows the steam to flow out of the pot.
The fire is first brought to the highest level to boil water, then brought to a lower level to produce steady heat.
Vegetables and foods are cooked in steam for about 10 - 15 minutes, and after being cooked thoroughly, are checked with a fork.
The cooked vegetables are removed from the oven and placed on plates to be served.
Steaming does not change the appearance, color, or smell of food, so it is healthy.
The original taste of the food remains the same.
So that the quality and taste of the food is preserved.
Steaming, also one of the most economical cooking methods, minimizes nutrient loss.
Steamed vegetables are more alive and vibrant, and they provide a satisfying feast for the eater.
This method is often preferred, especially in diet meals, because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "last" album by an alien who was not a member of the band
Knowing you were going to die, making that last album without telling anyone, making your deathbed an artistic space in the video you shot...
Such things may seem too "high" for us earthly mortals.
I say earthlings because I'm one of those people who believes that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came to our Earth from another part of the universe, and now he's back in his homeland, and that's all that's happened.
It came because there was an inspiration that should be given to all artists on Earth, not just Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He has done his duty well.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes Price: 9.99 5/5 5/5 The song is called "Still in Love"
Probably fed on Warhol, Kubrick, who was from the same planet as him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "What the hell, I'm an alien", and he broke into the crowd singing "Space Oddity".
He didn't really get involved; he was always a few steps ahead.
Many have found their lost ways because of him.
Both musician and listener...
Aside from his interest in fine art, his playfulness, and so on, it would be unfair to say that his music was "just music".
The characters that she creates, the references, the novelty, the taboo and the discography that she creates, that she creates from song to song, for me, is an artistic whole.
I wouldn't call him the father of glam rock or the cousin of punk...
If I do, what will become of the avant-garde electronic movements, the jazz that he has cherished since childhood?
David Bowie kept reminding us what the word meant until all these years ago when we were just chewing on the word "icon".
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't "man".
It was a body.
He's been on a mission for a while.
That body was gone two days after the release of his 26th studio album, Blackstar.
He tried to get us used to going with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that we heard before the album came out.
We thought, "He's old, he's talking about death and all that", he was aware of everything.
One more game...
The album's message and emotional charge were released long before the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", but the album was re-recorded and re-edited for "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" and the number of songs we knew were four when the album was released.
I'd like to say that the rest of the songs, "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are also very good songs.
All in all, it's a very strong musical structure, but it's also a very heartfelt, momentary feeling that's built into "Blackstar"...
Not death, not a "get over it" album.
Just a real "last" record.
"The End" is the first-to-last masterpiece of a musical life.
Turkey was targeted in the Sultanahmet attack
Holger Münch, head of the German Federal Security Service, made a statement on the attack that occurred on Tuesday in Sultanahmet Square and that claimed the lives of 10 German citizens.
Münch said the attack was aimed at Turkish citizens, not Germans.
"400 People in the Ministry"
However, Münch said that the attack on Sultanahmet did not change the terror threat in Germany, "We are still under a threat that should be taken seriously".
Münch noted that the number of people who went to Syria from Germany to join ISIS has decreased, and that a large number of people have returned from the war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people that we shouldn't be keeping under surveillance right now", Münch said, adding that this was a major challenge for security units.
Münch called for better coordination and closer communication between police agencies in Europe.
Turkish authorities said the bomber who carried out the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the identity of the attacker had not yet been established.
Sezen Aksu is saying goodbye to the stage.
Sezen Aksu, who celebrated his 40th birthday with a series of concerts, enchanted his fans with his "Sezen Years" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first part of the concert series was held in July, and the last part of the series was held on 15-16 January at the Volkswagen Arena.
At the concert, Akso took all the audience on a journey of 40 years from yesterday to today.
Besides love songs that touch our personal lives, Aksu sang songs about social issues that are of close concern to our country and our world.
Aksu, who said that he would say goodbye to his stage life after performing the concerts he promised, upset his fans.
At the "Sezenli Yıllar" concert, Sezen Aksu appeared with a different story in each song to the fans who filled the Volkswagen Arena.
Each story, performance, light and stage show took the audience into a different era.
The last part of the memorable concert was a video presentation of Devrim Erbil's Istanbul paintings.
Aksu also hosted his fans on stage for the first time, allowing them to record videos that they had previously recorded.
In Ankara and Istanbul, bread has increased by 25 cents
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread started to be sold yesterday for 25 cents, starting from 1 TL.
Before the new year, especially in December, the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Faruk Çelik and the Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tufenkci had made statements on the rumors of "Zam's future" as "Zam is not".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold yesterday for 1 TL.
Turkey Bakers Federation President Halil İbrahim Balci said, "There was no surcharge, the tariff decision was implemented two years ago".
"This was a tariff decision made two years ago".
The Chamber of Commerce set the rate two years ago.
It's a price that applies throughout Turkey.
So there's no new bidding on the price increase.
But because of the competition, in some areas of Ankara, the craftsmen were selling for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already selling for $1.
The merchant who relied on his shop, his bread, did not lower the price. Now they have to apply the 1 TL because of the competition.
No raise or promotion.
They're charging the unused price.
"In the first half of 2016, the price of a kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL and unless we have a big problem, we will finish the year with this price".
In some parts of Istanbul, bread started to be sold for 1.25 TL.
Terror has once again drained Burkina Faso of blood.
In the West African country of Burkina Faso, 23 people from 18 different countries were killed in an attack on a luxury hotel known to be a favorite of foreigners and United Nations officials.
The attack was claimed by the North African branch of Al Qaeda.
The attack in Burkina Faso came four days after the terrorist attack by ISIS in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim country with 250 million people.
A Canadian and an Indonesian were killed in a daylight bombing and gun attack on a Starbucks branch and a police station on a busy street lined with foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the Paris massacre on November 13.
Frank Garner, a security correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corporation, noted that this action was part of a frightening trend that has recently been manifesting itself in many cities around the world.
The United States has recently suffered from terrorist attacks.
In early December, 14 people were killed in a gun attack by a couple sympathetic to ISIS in San Bernardino, California, U.S.A.
The 'San Bernardino' attack that shook the United States
After the live bombing in Sultanahmet in which 10 German tourists were killed, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also reminded that there have been terrorist attacks in many parts of the world, saying, "We have experienced two major attacks in Paris".
If we say that, then terror has won...
We used the phrase "no retreat".
ISIS has left WhatsApp and Alrawi is talking to the app
A new report says that the terrorist organization ISIS is using its own chat tool to communicate independently of chat apps like WhatsApp and Telegram.
Defense One reports that the organization is using a new messaging app to send messages to each other.
This Android app, called "Alrawi", is distributed and downloaded via an APK file.
The app allows the organization to encrypt messages and share media among themselves.
Flash forward from ISIS in Iraq
The app's functionality remains "primitive" against popular apps like WhatsApp and Telegram, according to Ghost Security Group.
How strong the encryption used is still unknown.
ISIS previously communicated via the Telegram app, which allowed users to send messages over an encrypted link.
However, Telegram had revealed the channels that ISIS members were talking to.
And the U.S. government is asking app developers to install backdoors in their apps.
So instead of relying on encryption from WhatsApp and Telegram, the organization is now using its own solutions.
UAE: Iran has complied with nuclear deal
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran had complied with its obligations under the nuclear deal and the US had formally lifted economic sanctions against Iran: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that Iran had complied with its obligations under the nuclear deal.
President Hassan Rouhani tweeted his congratulations to the people of Iran for lifting sanctions after the nuclear deal between six countries and Tehran.

How should we view the semester break?
We asked Murat Aydın, an educational expert and student coach, how students should use their semester holidays.
Semester vacation should not be considered as just a time for students to relax, have fun, spend time in front of the TV and computer.
Semester vacation is a very important opportunity to prepare for the new training period and to review the past period.
The semi-annual holiday, called leisure, is also an important opportunity for personal development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a partial evaluation list.
Write down everything you plan to do and try to implement it.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and have a very productive semester.
Let's talk about how a productive semester should be for the students who are primarily preparing for YGS-LYS.
Because the questions we get most from our friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exams are: "How should we use this period, should we solve the abundant questions or should we solve the missing issues?"
To answer these questions and to have a productive term, let's start our article with advice to the friends who are preparing for the exam first.
While the exam preparation process should normally start from the ninth grade, we are trying to complete it in the last year, which for us means spending the last year more efficiently, efficiently and using time more accurately.
The senior student has to do his homework together as well as exam preparation.
The year in which a graduate student is preparing for the exam is also of critical importance, even if the graduate student has taken the exam (YGS-LYS) and experienced it at least once.
Because most of the graduating students and their parents see the year 'O' as their last chance, and that creates a lot of stress.
Studying is something that the student does not enjoy, that he does only because he feels compelled to do it, and that is why he is usually always the last one to do it, but for the students who make it a regular, habitual thing, it has become a full-fledged task, and it is always in the plan of what to do and when to do it.
We've got the semester off ahead of us and we've got to make the most of it.
So we have to have a plan to make sure that we manage our time well.
Studying during the semester:
Each one should first make a plan that is appropriate to his own situation.
The first period should plan what has been done and what is missing; the day, the week and the 15 days.
In this period, there should be both repetition and solution.
At the same time, students who are not very lacking can solve an average of 1-2 test questions.
Fix Your Missing Topics: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in a week, 66 percent in a day, and 54 percent in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetfulness is repetition.
Students who make too many mistakes in the past should pay more attention to general repetition.
First, identify your missing topics and plan for the day, put them in each day and make sure you do them.
This planning will help you both academically and psychologically.
And be careful to include the topics in your plan that you make the most mistakes in.
Because you're not going to have a vacation this long anytime soon.
Make the solution:
It's as important to solve the problem as it is to do the repetition.
Because the only way to know how much we understand about our work is by the answers we get from the questions we ask.
Remember to set a certain number of questions to solve each day.
The number of questions you're going to solve depends on the amount of work you're doing that day, and you might not be able to solve many questions on a day of heavy work, but we still have to do some work on solving questions to see how much we've learned about the topic that day.
Solve the test questions:
Another thing you'll be doing in your semester is solving the test questions.
Even though the subjects are not all over, you can at least do the lesson, the exam, the quiz.
Let's say you've done a lot of Turkish, you can solve 40 Turkish quizzes.
And make sure you do that with time-testing.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes at first, your next goal should be to solve them in a few minutes less if possible.
Holiday and Hobby Plan:
Of course, a vacation is not just a period of studying; you should also take a few days off for rest, recreation, and hobbies.
A vacation period spent only studying will prevent you from discharging and resting.
So, in your plans, you must include some time for yourself.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing the Internet may all be in your plans, but the most important thing is how much time you will spend on them.
And for those of you who feel that your first term was unproductive, I have a little advice.
If you think my first term was not very good, that I didn't do enough, that I'm missing a lot, this semester is a great opportunity for you.
But first, you have to decide and believe.
In the 2009-2010 season of the Turkish football super league, the most goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now, you answer your own question. Is the game over and you're going to the locker room, or is the game still on and you have a lot of minutes to play?
I guess nobody wants to say, "We'll look at the next game", which is a classic comment used by the coach or players of a losing football team.
All you have to do now is to leave the past behind and look ahead, not walk, but run.
So to summarize what we've been saying:
1) Plan a half-holiday as a priority,
2) Go over the topics you know, and do it again.
3) Fix your missing issues.
4) Do the subject consolidation by solving the question,
5) Solve the test questions
6) Read a book.
7) Set new goals for the new term,
8) Make time for yourself, your hobbies, and the things you enjoy.
9) Spend time with family and friends,
10) Take time for social and cultural activities (cinema, sports, theatre, concerts, excursions, picnics, etc.)
The caravan has come a long way
The founder of Kervan, one of the largest 'home' store chains in Turkey with 45 stores of an average of 1,000 square meters each, Şinasi Demirel and his son Hasan, joined the Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad and 25 stores in Turkey.
With the recent completion of the transaction, Kervan also owns 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Şinasi Demirel stated that there are no Kervan stores abroad, "Now we will continue with the big store Kervan and the smaller store Home Sweet Home".
"The caravan will also be opening abroad", he said.
With the merger of Home Sweet Home, which had a turnover of 50 million lira in 2015, and Kervan, which had a turnover of 90 million TL, a retail chain with a turnover and production of 140 million lira was created.
The total sales area of the caravan, with 45 caves in 35 provinces, is 45 thousand square meters.
25 of the stores are owned by the parent company.
There are about 500 jobs in the caravan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 stores in 25 countries and a total sales area of 6,500 square meters and employs 320 people.
Kadir Kalaycıoğlu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Home Sweet Home, which manufactures, exports and stores with his partner Alev Pakten, said they were very pleased with the merger with Kervan, "We are from Mardin and entered this sector in 1998".
From the beginning, with the support of the Sinasi Lords, we have created a brand.
Mr. Shinasi is the TRT of this industry.
And we learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step into retail when he gave us the White Center store.
We were already working with the caravan as a strategic partner, not a rival.
"Now with this merger, a very serious synergy will emerge", he said.
Kalaycıoğlu explained that Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, with the majority in the Middle East, and that they started exporting to China last month.
Kalaycıoğlu, "We opened our first corner in Shanghai".
We've got a deal with a chain of 200 stores.
"After this, we will develop the small store with Home Sweet Home as a large store with Caravan abroad", he said.
Poroshenko is selling his factory in Russia
Interviewed by Liga.net news site on the matter, Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky said the factory was put up for sale for $200 million.
Moskalevsky, "Yes, we have put the factory up for sale".
"As soon as it was put on sale, all the real buyers suddenly disappeared", he said, adding that there were no buyers.
As for the price of the firm's factory in the Russian city of Lipetsk, Moskalevsky said, "We have set it at about 200 million dollars".
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and confectionery a year, is one of the largest producers in the world and is owned by the President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko.
Yıldız Holding is Pladis abroad
Yıldız Holding has acquired and combined global companies operating in the biscuits and chocolate sectors under the name "Pladis".
With the merger of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Ulker, a new $5.2 billion food giant with 26,000 employees was born.
Speaking at the meeting on the consolidation of global companies within Yıldız Holding, Murat Ülker, Yıldız Holding's Board of Directors Chairman, said, "Being a Global company was our goal from the beginning" and added:
Murat Ülker has broadcast live from Periscope the sale of 335 million liras
Founded 72 years ago, Yıldız Holding is now a global brand in the chocolate biscuit business.
In that time, we've grown from chocolate biscuit to retail to packaging to real estate to personal care and a variety of industries.
We have 77 factories, 300 brands, thousands of outlets in 14 countries.
Saying that the whole Yıldız Holding is "a family of more than 50 thousand people", Ülker said, "Now that we look at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back and focus on making biscuit chocolate, our main business, and become global in this field; we are reorganizing for this", and described the new structure as follows:
The life story of Sabri Bey, the father of Ülker
We're reevaluating our corporate structure, reorganizing the whole thing.
We've divided the world into zones.
And we've allocated these areas to our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammed and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü, Turkey is responsible for the Middle East, North Africa and the Turkish Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva business, as well as the Americas and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of the UK, Continental Europe and Africa.
Ali Ulker, who I would call the quality and innovation guru, will assume global responsibility for his field, while Cem Karakash will help me manage the business.
China, Russia, part of Southeast Asia will be the new areas we build and develop.
Murat Ülker has sold his stake in SAF GYO
Murat Ülker, who continues his words, "Every bite promises happiness to the whole world", said, "The name of our global company that we have created to make this happen is Pladis".
"If you ask me where you invented Pladis, it's not really a name that has any particular meaning", he said, adding:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we are inspired by the name of the constellation of the Pleiades, which is made up of seven stars in Latin, which means "Earth".
So we translated the whole thing into the globe.
Yıldız Holding's Vice President Ali Ülker also emphasized that they have "started to create synergies in innovation" by collaborating with laboratories in different countries and added:
We have very valuable R&amp;D teams, and by bringing these teams together, we've gotten some synergies so far in working on an R&amp;D platform.
We have 27 R&amp;D centers under Pladis.
The largest of these are in Turkey and England.
We have over 300 R&D specialists working here.
And the synergy studies are already starting to yield results.
The drage (Nibbles) of Digestives, which is produced in Ulker and will start exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri at Ulker's chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: different brands but the same product, Ulker Krispi Fritz.
We have adapted a cracker technology developed in England, Jacob's Crinklys, to Turkey, and we have brought a nice taste to our country under the name Ülker Krispi Tırtıklı.
Laviva, as we all know him, met with consumers in the United States today.
The Call of Duty series has surpassed the 250 million mark.
The series, which has been written in gold letters by Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games, looks like it's going to be remembered for many years to come.
Especially the newly announced sales figures, which are proof of how legendary we should find them.
Activision, which holds the licensing rights to the series, showed 250 million copies in its year-end exclusive sales count.
The company, which shared the sales of the entire series at the beginning of last year, has since managed to sell 75 million Call of Duty games.
And a large part of that number is undoubtedly Black Ops 3, which is a game that we can't really say that it's wrong.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected as the President of the Republic
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected as the general president of the Ordinary Assembly.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who received the votes of 990 delegates out of 238, became the president again.
248 of the votes cast were invalid.
After the result was announced, the party members were in a show of joy.
There were a total of 275, 000 delegates of the CHP.
The board has finished its work for Sunday at 10.00.
Kılıçdaroğlu summed up the meeting as follows:
We'd like to see games played, songs sung.
But the point where we're at is not very exciting.
There is an unmanaged Turkey reality.
The atmosphere that forms overshadows all of this.
The decision-making table is about who runs the country.
We, the CHP, are against terrorism, wherever it comes from, however it comes.
Terrorism is a crime against humanity, and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terrorism is done with intelligence, it is done with knowledge, it is done with enlightenment.
Of course we'll fight, we don't want anyone to bleed out.
What's the difference between the photos in Syria, the photos in Lebanon, the photos in the Southeast?
They made some serious mistakes sitting at the table.
All the blood, tears, deaths are the fault of the government.
In 2002, they took over the country with zero terror, today there is a Turkey that has turned into a lake of blood.
Who's responsible for all this?
The taxi driver in Diyarbakir is our lover?
What is Turkey paying for?
We will attend meetings, we will express our opinion on the change of the coup laws.
We will not allow anyone to build a country on their personal opinions.
I say, "Let's switch the coup spirit".
The brightest in this country are being raided in the morning, detained because they've expressed their thoughts.
There are aspects of it that we don't agree with, but people should be able to express their opinions freely.
This dictator's vice is to eat the bread of the state and to be hostile to the state.
I want to ask him, why did those who eat the bread of the state and enjoy all the resources of the state not think while robbing the state?
The CHP is the party that has brought the biggest change to this country.
We will prepare for the fourth great revolution together.
Whatever it takes, we will bring liberal democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can detain us, whatever they do, whatever the cost, CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I call you openly, son of David.
Hiding behind the law of the coup, the man who hides behind the law of the coup has not lost his mind.
You gave the man who gave you the medal a Distinguished Service Medal.
What coup are you talking about?
We're all about deceiving the public.
Party officials ranked the other 3 revolutions as follows: 1. the great revolution put an end to the monarchy and founded the Republic; 2. the great revolution went from the one-party period to the multi-party period during the Inun; 3. the revolution Bülent Ecevit and the transition to social democracy...
The president has qualities, duties.
Article 103 is the oath of the president.
We know how important honor and dignity are in this society.
A man must not make vows until he dies.
Because honor and honour are unquestionable for us.
The man with the dictator's badge, what honor and dignity mean to you.
What do you know of honor and honour, why did you take this oath?
What do you mean by honor and dignity?
I want to know that.
In a religious man, honor and honour are the crown of his head.
Their intention is not to abolish the coup law, but to investigate the coup law.
It's not enough. They want the presidential system.
How about the presidency? The bossy presidency.
Why do you reject the Ottoman parliamentary system?
One man commands, and all do their duty.
Do parliamentarians work well in Turkey?
No, it's not working.
If we bring liberal democracy, the system will work.
They call it a coup, but they've strengthened the coup law.
Mustafa Balbay, a member of the İzmir parliament, who announced his candidacy for the presidency, did not participate in the race because he could not collect the necessary 128 signatures of the delegation.
Balbay, who collected 92 signatures, said, "I cannot be a candidate under the current circumstances".
In the parliamentary hall, there are seats reserved for MPs of the party's parliament (PM), the central executive committee (MYK) and the honorary board members, while former CHP Leader Deniz Baykal sat on the tribunes with party members.
Gülay Yedekçi, a member of parliament, came early and sat next to the seat reserved for the President of the Republic, Kılıçdaroğlu, instead of sitting in the seat reserved for his deputies.
The meeting between Yalova MP Muharrem Ince and Kılıçdaroğlu was also one of the topics discussed in the congress.
Ince explained that he was offered the PM membership and that he did not accept it.
However, sources from the general headquarters claimed that the request for a meeting came from Ince and that PM membership was not recommended.
Ince tweeted, "Kimse is the general headquarters source, the content of the meeting can be learned from Istanbul MP Ali Özcan".
And your reasoning is, "How could I know about two people meeting?"
He just said, "He's gone".
Kılıçdaroğlu often applauded his father.
The first day of the usual "Council for Democracy, Change and Brotherhood" was marked by the backstage of the party congress (PM).
Kılıçdaroğlu went home after the parliamentary speech and started working on the PM list.
It was learned that while Kılıçdaroğlu was preparing the key list of 100 people, he told 13 MYK members, apart from Seyhan Erdoğdu, who once again became a candidate for PM, Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and Seyhan Erdoğdu, who did not apply to PM, explaining that they did not want to take part in the administration, and said that he would give them a place on the list by calling by phone.
It is stated that Kılıçdaroğlu may point to another list of 100 people as well as a narrowed list of PM keys.
The 21 point final report, which was unanimously adopted at the CHP Congress, called for the removal of the drafts on the European Local Government Convention that had been raised by the DTK's autonomy discussions, and for the increase in the division of powers in local government.
The declaration also included the goals of "ending the party system of government", "establishing a transparent and accountable state of law".
The meeting was attended by Vice President Selçuk Özdağ from the AK Party, İdris Baluken from the HDP and Ruhsar Demirel from the MHP.
The AK Party delegation and the AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu strongly criticized President Erdoğan.
Özdağ said, "I saw that the criticism was missing a dose, I could not accept it".
The hall was also marked with a banner with the photos of the detained journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül, "If you don't burn, I won't burn" and "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English.
The assembly started in the morning with the songs of Grup Yorum and Ahmet Kaya.
The message sent to the council by the wife of the Diyarbakır Baron Tahir Elçi, who lost his life in the armed attack, received a great applause.
Berkin Elvan's mother Gülsüm and father Sami Elvan also attended the meeting.
The part where Kılıçdaroğlu said they would take over the democracy "to the death", whatever the price was, was the most applauded part of the speech.
The CHP, which has so far won 34 ordinary and 52 extraordinary seats, held its 53rd grand assembly in the Ankara Arena yesterday.
Turnout was high.
There were over 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat hall.
But there was no enthusiasm from the crowd.
The most exciting moment was when Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued as the Kılıçdaroğlu couple greeted the hall.
There was no trace of the discipline seen at the AK Party congresses in the hall.
Even as Kılıçdaroğlu was speaking, there was a great deal of activity in the arena in the field area of the arena.
It is clear that the CHP members who wanted to enter the Party Mejlis preferred to seek support by telling the party leaders and journalists about themselves.
A CHP executive tried to explain that this was not a bad thing by saying, "It is better than the party leaders sitting in a line like a rope, like at the party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union".
There is another difference between the CHP congress and the AK Party or MHP congresses.
Only CEOs speak at these parties.
In the CHP, the congress becomes a platform where party issues are discussed.
The number of speakers at yesterday's party congress was too high, so the chairman of the Chamber, Murat Karayalç, had difficulty in arranging the time.
Although the expression "The country is going badly" was in the faces and languages, there was also a distance against the comments "You can change the course with this picture that will leave the hall".
All the CHPs said "Something must be done" but there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "What to do".
The effect of this is that there will be no elections in the next four years.
When Kılıçdaroğlu took the stage, we journalists also waited for his answer to the question "What to do".
Kılıçdaroğlu first answered the question "What's going on?"
He pointed out the issue of imprisoned journalists, the attacks on academics because of the report, the events in the Southeast, the impasse in foreign policy.
He responded at length to the "Anatol myths" about the CHP, such as "it is a non-religious party", "supports coups", "it is the party of the elitists".
And when it came to the "what to do" phase, he tried to come up with a "strategy" instead of talking about concrete steps.
He stressed that all these problems could be overcome with stronger democracy and more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP that "we will work at any cost until we bring democracy".
"We will fight to the death for democracy", he said.
One last note: It is also worth recalling that the CHP has solved the "organization" issue with the 53rd congress, and now it is able to hold the congress without any problems.
By the way, the 900 journalists who were supposed to cover the rally had their cards printed, but the journalists in the room weren't as engaged.
The media representatives in Ankara were not as willing to follow the convention as the AK Party representatives.
The Özyönet was asked for life imprisonment
The indictment prepared by the Diyarbakır Republican Prosecutor's Office against 7 defendants, 3 of whom are in custody, was accepted by the 4th Heavy Penal Court.
The indictment stated that on the instructions and calls of the top level managers of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization, explanations were made under the name of "self-government" in some districts and neighborhoods of Diyarbakir, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı.
The indictment, which stated that the heads of the organization and youth and women's organizations had made calls for illegal actions, recorded an increase in bombings, long-range weapons and rocket attacks against security forces, public institutions and organizations, homes, workplaces and vehicles of citizens in Sur, Baglar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts of Diyarbakır.
ISIS and opposition clashes, our post was shot down
The fighting between the Syrian factions of the Fatah Army and the Islamic State (ISIS) in the Syrian villages of Duden, Kara Mezra Bıgıddin and Kara Köprülü, opposite the village of Yavuzlu, Kilis, has intensified in recent days.
The sound of guns and shells fired during the clashes between ISIS and the opposition near the border is also heard by Turkey.
Smoke rising from the areas where frequent explosions occurred was visible to the naked eye by Turkey, while the security forces took intensive measures with armored vehicles on the border line.
On the other hand, the harassment fire was opened at the Martyr Mehmet Border Guard near the Yavuzlu village of Kilis from the village of Bagiddin, which is controlled by ISIS militants.
In accordance with the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded with mortars and heavy weapons to the area where the firing was carried out.
Russian warplanes allegedly attacked the village of Hameyin, 17 kilometers from the Turkish border.
Six Syrians injured in the airstrikes were taken to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
The rich got their lotto checks .
The Robinsons, who live in a small house worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million over a 29-year period, rather than a total of $528.8 million.
The couple said, "After all, there are no guarantees of tomorrow".
John Robinson, who works at a chain store, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant to a dermatologist, said that even though they're now millionaires, they'll be back at work on Monday.
The couple's primary goal is to use the money they make to pay off their mortgage and help their loved ones.
The grand prize was announced to be divided into three.
iOS9: how to get the new iPhone operating system, Apple update released
You can go to the Settings app for the new operating system, tap "Restore" and choose "Update Software".
When it's ready, your phone will offer you the option to download and install.
Some users have experienced a problem after this installation and received an error message saying "Subscription update failed".
To overcome this problem, users are advised to wait for the system load to decrease or try and upgrade from iTunes.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may include deleting apps to free up space - but Apple has prevented this from happening by minimizing the update, and recommending some apps to be deleted and using a special tool to reinstall them when the process is over.
To keep your battery from running out while the update is going on, it's worth making sure that your phone is charged or near a charger.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't allow the update, because the phone might stop halfway through, which would cut the update.

FedEx's revenue is mixed, financials are going to fall in 2016.
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months and has lowered its full-year earnings forecast due to a decline in demand for cargo services and rising costs for ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
It's down about 2.5% in pre-op trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects earnings of $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts were expecting $10.84 based on research done by FactSet.
It looks likely to fall, despite an average increase of 4.9% effective January 4 and high surges in heavy or large packages on the ground starting in November.
The company said that cost cuts, higher revenue and gains from e-commerce growth are still expected to be higher than the previous year.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was "performing robustly despite weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, the same number as last year.
In the three months ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, a 6% increase over the prior year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, falling behind the $2.44 forecast of 12 analysts reviewed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue up 5%, to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts Zacks interviewed were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx was hit last year by a decline in international priority shipping, which caused revenue to stagnate across the Express unit.
But the explosion in online shopping has boosted the FedEx Ground Services results.
In the last quarter, ground services revenue rose 29%, but operating income was largely stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
The express unit saw higher revenue due to higher base rates, while revenue in the cargo business fell due to higher labor costs.
In pre-op trading, about an hour before the opening bell, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5%, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below their June 11 record.
In their most anticipated meeting in years, Federal Reserve policymakers this week spent two days around a 27-foot Honduras maunu table deciding that it was not yet time to raise the interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
The two-story boardroom in one wing of the Federal Reserve will be a mural of the United States.
A reminder that Janet L. Yellen, the woman president of the Fed, and her colleagues, have put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
The Fed has two missions from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment and to keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have recognized that there is a third unwritten mandate: fiscal equilibrium.
And this third mandate could be an unpredictably close X factor in the decision to be made on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to begin to cut back on the unprecedented stimulus support from the near-zero short-term interest rate that has been going on since late 2008.
While most data indicates that the economy is growing robustly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may at present make cautious Fed officials wary of adding vulnerability by raising the benchmark federal funds rate - even by less than a quarter of a percent.
"Clearly the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they watch", said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to raise the rate, the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer", he said.
The Fed has no consensus on what to do, and that in itself is causing fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists Bloomberg recently interviewed expected a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect the Fed to remain on hold with the main index showing only a roughly 30% chance of an increase.
This could signal a stock market decline if the Fed raises the rate, unless policymakers mitigate the impact by promising that another increase may be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
"The increase was triggered by expectations that Fed policymakers would keep the rate flat this week", said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
He said, "It would be surprising if the Fed were to raise rates right now".
If the Fed's directors had decided to do so, "they would have had to take a long year to calm the financial markets so that they wouldn't panic".
Other experts suggested that a rate hike could calm financial markets as the fog lifted over when the Fed would act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on track to raise rates by 0.25 points this month, a small step that would make it harder for the U.S. to recover as monetary conditions slowly tighten.
Yellen said she expects a rate increase this spring and early summer, despite the Liberals' complaints about the need for a more economic process.
Despite the slowdown in job creation in August, growth in the labor market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent last month, near the Fed's full employment numbers.
Wage increases have shown signs of improvement.
And while inflation continues to sit below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed policymakers said the temporary impact of sharply lower oil prices was a major factor.
Pantheon Macroeconomics chief economist Ian Shepherdson said the economy "can cope with higher rates and needs to despite the tightness in the labor market".
But financial markets around the world began to shake after China devaluated its currency late last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen below its May all-time high of 16%, as investors fear a slowing Chinese economy could drag down global growth.
The market has somehow bounced back, with the Dow now almost 10% below its May high.
For Fed policymakers, market volatility makes it more complicated to calculate when the interest rate will be raised.
"The last few weeks in the Chinese economy may have been a little bit of a stretch for them in this meeting with the lack of news on the financial markets and the unknowns and the economic weakness", said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research associate at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now he estimates they'll have to wait at least another month to better manage these effects.
"There is too much uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data to rely on to date developments in China", Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not a top concern for the Fed, so technically it shouldn't be a factor in the debt-to-equity ratios.
But in reality, the Fed has become the world's financial authority.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only hint from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could "de-escalate" the monetary expansion triggered by the worldwide market shocks.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only follow developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central bankers and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, chief global strategy officer at asset management firm Envestnet Inc., said that decision-making is "more a skill than a science".
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., this month noted that "the Fed has overreacted in the past to movements in financial markets that do not appear to be connected to economic fundamentals".
Lacker, a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee, who lobbied for rate increases, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
Lacker said that "despite limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth", the Asian financial crisis caused the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75 points over three meetings.
A year later, the Fed reversed those cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee, said the Fed should "only put fiscal equilibrium concerns at the forefront during major crises, such as the 2008 market meltdown".
He said the last one wasn't even close.
"You really don't want to be in a situation where you're afraid that you're going to go up one rate because the markets are grim", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and no mention of fiscal balance and until that changes I don't think they should be making any move in that direction.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, the Chinatown
The depot opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
The LAX-C, often referred to as the Thai Costco, is a Thai market that sells to the mass market.
Yeah, it's Chinatown, not the Taiwanese.
The market/depot is a one-stop shop that sells a wide variety of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchen items, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive part if you want to buy engine oil.
The store is huge and it can take an hour to walk through all the halls.
If you get hungry from all this shopping, grab some food from the LAX-C BBQ Eksres.
The store's in-store food section is next to the (good, checked) checkout, and there are a variety of take-out options.
What's in stock: do you want something Thai?
It's probably at LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes specialty Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and more.
The meat shelf is extensive, and so is the fish - the workers behind the counter clean the fish and make it into fillets, or even fry it if you like.
A large part of the store has a large freezer section where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole duck, fish, calf's blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial food, and more.
Who's shopping: restaurant owners and chefs, families and individuals.
The wide corridors are lined with shopping carts and forklift trucks.
Found: Fresh monthong durian right by the exit stand.
Location: The store is located between Chinatown and Downtown in the industrial section of Los Angeles, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, it's not usually difficult to find a parking space.
The Rio Grande Pediatric Society of Brazil is promoting healthy feeding during breast-feeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has used a shocking method to try and teach women the importance of healthy eating during breastfeeding by using images of infants with images of unhealthy foods.
Human milk is made up of many different types of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, which provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Due to their excess energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to around 500 calories.
However, new research suggests that mothers should supplement their diet not just with calories.
A new study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas found that healthy eating by pregnant women can affect the genetic expression of their babies and protect them from developing tumors.
Sadly, unhealthy eating has been shown to adversely affect a child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate the ratings despite Nine's attempts to take the lead on the Today Show.
The moves by Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to overthrow the Liberal leadership in Canberra failed to deliver a ratings boost for Today.
After Tony Abbott's Malcolm Turnbull's fall, Nine's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, Rival Sunrise is squeezed between weekly international series that include Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance issue doesn't seem to make much of a difference to Australian viewers, with Sunrise averaging 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today's 339,000.
Today on Monday (317,000) had a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (283,000) but the number was still behind last Thursday (343,000)
Today has been closing in on Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Sunrise's average was 318,000, compared to 330,000 for Today.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
Sunrise's average is 349,000 as of September against Today's 314,000.
This is the most exciting thing that happens in all the mornings.
The winds of change are blowing more at the people this morning than at Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the pale cutting start to the 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move to the seaside in New Zealand with his two children has reached an impressive 1.219 million.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson could run a solo show without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night was a resounding "yes".
Seven's X Factor maintained its strength with 1,136 million viewers, easily beating Block (838,000) and the TBL Family (726,000).
Seven Two-Track Australia has mixed their fortunes with the night.
The first half hour (17:00-17:30) of the new information contest hosted by Andrew O'Keefe averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half-hour (17:30-18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 viewers - a small victory against Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613,000) was enough.
The first half-hour of Monday Night-Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, while the second half-hour saw 720,000.
Hot Seat had a 620,000 average.
The second night of the Australian chase, the drop in ratings, made Nine think that the Hot Seat would take the lead at 5:30.
The follow-up, Australia, was a replacement for the Million Dollar Minute, which had failed to impress McGuire's show.

The last three think that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who's he gonna pick?
Is the secret out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unwittingly predicted who would win The Bachelorette.
The woman Sam Wood would eventually choose for his bachelor program was a closely guarded secret.
And the three remaining girls are doing their best not to tell you who the last flower is.
But if we check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski the day before the three were split, they may have given a clue without knowing who the winner would be.
Sam Wood has sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
All three women gave a lyrical account of why Wood was so excellent, emphasizing his sense of humor, his ambition, his family values, and his positive attitude, and why they wanted to be his partner.
But their answers to the question, "If you don't, who should get Wood's last rose?" might contain some information about who's going to win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood outside themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been close since day one.
"From the moment I came home", said Jeavons-Fellows, "I felt that [Sarah's] energy and Sam's energy were compatible, and I thought that throughout the program".
Markoski added, "Sarah is very practical, it's a lot of fun to be around her".
I've seen them together and there's a chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable when they're burning each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks that she and Sam Wood will be a very good match.
Mackay said that his home visit appointments last week made him think that Wood was "the one".
"Seeing him with my friends and family made me realize that this was definitely not just a game - I was totally committed to him now", she said.
When asked who Wood would choose without her, she was cryptic.
"I don't know if I can say that", he said.
"I like other girls equally - Snezana and Lana equally".
The Bachelor is on Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.
First broadcast, is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options for where to begin his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle themselves have shown a lot of interest in him since he moved to the States, and after last year's impressive open practice day, many other teams have approached him.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and that sounds like a very wise decision.
Some coaches have put Hayne on the bench for his loss in the Australian rugby league performance, such as in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed him, and gave Hayne another chance, a role in the aftermath of Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her true colour in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of humiliating the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also openly supported Hayne at the post-match press conference.
49ers reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received encouragement from special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the fall and think about the next play.
Jarryd Hayne, in the first quarter, led the Minnesota Vikings to a score and a touchdown.
This was not what Hayne and his vast Australian fan base had imagined for their first game in the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing as he left the field after dropping the ball, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not think of a worse start to his NFL career.
Hayne said, "It was just one of those things, you get upset about the next play, and that's it".
Hayne also remembered his first match in the 2007 Origin with a backhand that scored for Queensland.
Still, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old actress.
Hayne posted a photo of himself holding an Australian flag with fans after the game on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin are meeting to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint at a Siberian border crossing.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was jailed, the oil company Yukos was seized, and his pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
4 killed in police plastic bullet-throwing on protesters in Nepal
On Wednesday, four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed when police fired plastic bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, an official said.
The incident occurred Tuesday evening in the town of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Chief provincial official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that about 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station and that some of them were throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dhakal said that the police fired pepper spray in the air before using the plastic bullets.
He said 20 police and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets, which are known to kill, but are generally a less lethal alternative, have resulted in such a high case fatality rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests across Nepal's southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group argue that the regions created by the proposed new constitution will dilute their political influence.
The ethnic group Tharus, who want to establish their own state, are also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have lost their lives in violent clashes since August 10.
On this date, the four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions - an important but disturbing step in the preparation of a new constitution for Nepal, which has been ruled by the central government for centuries.
Work on a new constitution had been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April that killed thousands of people.
Lawmakers have been working on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new text will be ready by Sunday.
NHC says there's a 60 percent chance of a hurricane south of the Cape Verde Islands.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday that there is a 60 percent chance that a broad low pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands will develop into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system was seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, and the Miami-based weather center said there was a 60 percent chance of a tropical cyclone forming within the next two days.
Google has launched a matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a matching campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries to Europe.
Google announced its donation initiative on its blog in an unexpectedly personal approach.
Instead of an executive making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote her own personal experience.
"We went on many dark bus and train journeys, along with hunger, thirst, cold, and fear", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But with the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe growing, many families, like mine, need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said that they would match the first $5.5 million donation to google.com/refugeerelief until they had raised $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest one being the four-year Syrian civil war that has displaced more than four million people this year alone.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Moderately obese diabetics may benefit from weight loss surgery
A new study suggests that it may take at least five years for moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes to see the benefits of obesity surgery.
But it's too early to tell whether moderately obese diabetics will live longer after their obesity surgery than non-surgery patients.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery and author of a recent JAMA study on surgery, "it takes a long time for mortality rates to show up".
Weight-loss surgery, also known as bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the abdomen.
These reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been done in people with severe obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or above.
A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9, which is a weight-to-height ratio, is considered normal.
A BMI of 25 or more is overweight, and those with a BMI of 30 or more are considered obese.
You can calculate BMI from this link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital used data from an experiment comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and tube gastric surgery - that have been used since 2007 to treat moderately obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
By the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those who had surgery had dropped from 31 to 24.5.
Conversely, those who received nonsurgical treatment for diabetes had a BMI of about 29.
Diabetes was completely resolved in 36% of those who had surgery, and partially in 28%.
In comparison, only 1% of the medically treated group had fully resolved diabetes and only 2% had partially resolved diabetes.
The authors also noted that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "surgery-treated group".
The researchers also imaged the blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the blood sugar over time, in the patients.
The researchers wrote that it's best to keep hemoglobin A1c below seven percent.
Post-op A1c has dropped from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medicated group, it was about 8 percent.
But with improved A1c levels, this better "glycemic control" did not reduce the mortality rate over the five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his team, who led the study.
The research team compared the available data with these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg) than the group with tube gastric surgery, had greater decreases in BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and, similarly, in hemoglobin A1c (3.1 to 2.1%) and had a higher probability of diabetes reversion overall (46.9 to 16.7%).
Although the study did not show any clear benefit in survival at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone of the Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix said that he had valid data that surgery extended life span, based on a study conducted in Sweden on overweight patients.
In this Swedish study, obese patients who had undergone bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than a similar group who had received conventional treatment.
Although this new study doesn't show any survival benefit for surgery patients, Blackstone says it's relevant and reassuring for those with a BMI under 35.
And this is the most telling part of the article, because it says that in the group with a low BMI, this surgery is safe, there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking the weight gain seriously as soon as the patient's BMI falls below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this seriously, he said.
I think once you've collected these genetic changes in their bodies that are associated with obesity and diabetes, it's really hard to reverse that.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said Europe could not host all the refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lay in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee countries.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK, the Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Compassion Centre in Oxford, which will study ethical issues.
He argued that under existing conditions, the interests of humanity must take precedence over the interests of countries or continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, while commendable, was insufficient in this regard.
In his speech he said, "It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe".
While he appreciated the efforts of Germany and Austria to deal with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said that these were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions, you have to think about how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, mainly through education", he stressed.
We have to think about how we can reduce the deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the power.
The use of force has never been the solution to problems".
In his discussion of violence, the Dalai Lama also referred to George Bush's actions after the 9/11 attacks, and said that the violent response of the United States has triggered a chain of events that are uncontrollable.
In my letter to President Bush after 9/11, I expressed my wishes for his health and that the solution to this problem was nonviolent.
I know their intentions are good, but he used force and caused unintended consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in hand antiseptic swallowed by children in the last four years
Poison control centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in swallowed wet wipes containing high levels of alcohol in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, the number of reported cases of hand antiseptic swallowing in children under 12 years of age has increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Kids are more interested in these products and unfortunately there are some that are in the urgent removal process", Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids were drinking hand antiseptics knowingly, and some were doing it to impress their friends or in a social media claim.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking antiseptic for the sake of cheap drunkenness.
Some teenagers have been reported to mix antiseptic mixture with alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Young children can be attracted to the antiseptic smell.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think it's a bad thing", and he said, "I don't think it's a bad thing".
The ones that are more attractive are the ones that have a smell.
There are hand sanitizers with the aromas of strawberries, grapes and oranges that are very appealing to children.
Hand antiseptics are anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few sips can cause alcohol poisoning.
Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the poisoning center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 television that Kansas City is "highly concentrated in alcohol".
You don't leave a couple of whiskey glasses lying around, but people leave these hand antiseptics lying around, and that's an easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed only four strawberry-scented hand antiseptics at school, was admitted to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was .179, according to emergency room physician Dr. Chris Ritchey, who treated him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, twice the legal alcohol limit for an adult.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce words, and when he got to the emergency room, he couldn't walk.
Rithey reported that the alcohol had caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, so the doctors kept her overnight in a separate children's hospital despite any indication of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that it was "very scary".
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep antiseptic wipes out of reach of children.
Except for alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been found to be associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a hand antiseptic containing an unidentified poisonous substance.
Health officials had suggested that the substance in question might not be ethyl alcohol as listed in the ingredients list, but methyl alcohol, which has a lethal effect.
In January, three fourth-grade students from upstate New York plotted to "place antibacterial products around the classroom" to poison their "evil-hearted" teachers, according to police reports.
The teacher has banned it from the classroom because of an extreme allergy to hand sanitizer.
The police described the plan as a "failed attempt" and recommended disciplinary action against the school.
You should come to Samandera.
Robin van Persie, who watched Fenerbahçe play their Europa League match against Lokomotif Kuban, joined Udoh, Vesely and Melih at the end of the match.
Van Persie, who had a warm conversation with Udoh, who is a fan of his, "I came to watch you".
You and your friends are gonna watch me practice.
"I'll wait for you at Samandira", he said.
The two parties are innocent.
I'm such a humanitarian today.
I want no deaths.
But what's possible!
This world is cruel.
You're a whore.
There's death in the destiny.
The pain.
So is the alien invasion.
And the lightning strike.
A space shuttle that crashes sometimes.
It could be a meteor.
I'm not saying that there aren't deaths.
I say we sign off.
Let's have a reaction.
Let's say the whore is a whore, what a disaster!
May our humanism be magnified.
Shame on the parish.
But he ain't fucking ashamed!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray İnce in the Sur neighborhood of Şırnak.
She was only three months old.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him too.
What can we say, they are bitches! On January 3rd, they killed Yusuf Yağıcı in Silopi.
I think he was running from aliens.
They searched him for a safe place.
His wife was with him.
The next day, they killed Melek Alpaydin at breakfast table in Küçük Aktarlı Street in Diyarbakır.
A day or two later, aliens burned down Sema Chinglioglu Elementary School.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school full of students with firearms.
The students ran back and forth.
On January 10, the bodies of three men were left in the Hazret Hüseyin Mosque in the neighborhood of Şehit Harun Boy, who were killed by the attack of the kahpe feleq.
Two days ago, three children lost their lives in the Çınar district of Diyarbakır.
An unidentified object, a ton of explosives, took the lives of these little ones.
There were other people killed, others injured.
Who is to blame?
Felek, of course.
The bitch is a bitch.
No, it's not the hooker that's the bitch.
The bitch is innocent!
The killer is outside, waving his hand and smiling at us.
Some try to distract attention.
With the killer in sight, instead of pointing at him, he creates opportunities for him to escape.
The killer is getting away.
He's hiding her.
And after he disappears, he tells the next person that it wasn't his fault.
The last 10 years of this fight, the sides are clear.
Someone wants to narrow the circle of fire around us and burn us.
And someone is trying to stop it, and even more, to put out the fire around us.
Someone's worried about the destruction, the robbery.
Someone to do, to produce.
There are those who see us, our region, ravaged by every kind of war.
The civil war.
The War Between the States.
The Crusades.
The proxy war.
And they have their own tacherons.
The dirty terrorist groups.
They're all bloodhounds.
Different names, different formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each of them.
He's at war, and therefore he must deal with the evil of it all.
We'll keep fighting until we're sure of our...
The traitors have no skirt, they're wearing white.
The PKK terrorists, who are trapped in the neighborhood, find the solution by fleeing and mingling with the white flags and the civilians.
And the security forces are implementing GBT to prevent the leak.
The organization, which has been unable to take action in the countryside and beyond the border with the peace and democracy operations that began on July 23, is also weakening its action power in the districts.

Saudi Arabia has not given up on TÜBİTAK
Minister of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık said that a new agreement has been made for the second sale of the Ballistic Image Analysis and Identification System (BALİSTİKA) developed by the Scientific and Technical Research Institute of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) to Saudi Arabia, adding that "the number of BALİSTİKA to serve in Saudi Arabia will go from 6 to 14 with the agreement that covers the development and installation of 8 additional systems".
Işık made a statement regarding the ballistics developed by the TÜBİTAK Space Technologies Research Institute.
Işık said that the system enabled the ballistic examination of the weapons, the bullet core and the shells captured in the incidents to be compared with the data found in the central database, thus eliminating the problems encountered by ballistics experts when examining the shells and bullet cores.
Light said that data from different geographical locations and the accompanying information could be stored together and interrogated thanks to BALISTICS.
Işık pointed out that one of the most important features of BALISTIC is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data with more detail and fewer errors, and emphasized that thanks to the innovations brought by the system, the decisions to be made by the ballistics expert can be made quickly and the success rate is greatly increased.
BALISTIK was exported under "SUBA-1 Project"
Işık said that BALISTICA met all the criteria in the success criteria and that it received a full note from the Directorate General of Security, noting that the system, which was established in 10 separate regions, including Ankara, covers the whole of Turkey.
Işık said that the system was successfully launched abroad, and recalled that BALISTICA was exported as part of the SUBA-1 Project with Saudi Arabia and that the installation was successfully completed in 6 regions in 2013.
Işık said that a new agreement was made for the second-party sale of BALISTICA to Saudi Arabia, SUBA-2 was signed, which is the continuation of SUBA-1, and the number of BALISTICA to serve in Saudi Arabia will increase from 6 to 14 with the agreement, which includes the development and installation of 8 additional systems.
Fossil crocodile found as big as a bus
The prehistoric sea crocodile is reported to have been 10 metres long and weighed three tonnes.
The crocodile's skull alone was measured to be five feet (1.6 m) long.
The researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published their findings in the journal Cretaceous Research.
The lead author of the article, Federico Fanti of the University of Bologna, said that the fossil, which is estimated to be 130 million years old, is "almost the size of a bus".
Fanti told the Washington Post that the giant saltwater crocodile "was at the top of the food chain in at least one region at that time".
Paleontologists have revealed that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile in the sea, preyed on lagoons by ambushing.
The largest freshwater crocodile in history is thought to be Sarcosuchus imperator, which lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could grow up to 12 meters tall and weigh up to 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
The first book of writer Ece Temelkuran, 'All Women's Heads are Confused' from 1996, was adapted by Aysa Production Theater into the theater with the same name.
The play is directed by Selen Uçer, starring Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Türktan Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez.
The play, which is the first time that Ucher, who continues to write plays called 'Poz' and 'Dry Tight', has experience as a scriptwriter and director, questions the confusion in women's minds.
The play met with an audience at the Trump Performing Arts Center last week.
The game starts with the radio play.
In the darkness, a voice that takes us back to the years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing on the edge of a window, about to jump down.
Who he was and why he tried to kill himself, as his next-door neighbors intervened.
I 'm going to be a cop .
'Ebru Uysal', played by Deniz Çakır, is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's got a lot of stuff from when he was a kid.
The lack of a father's love, the exclusion of his student life, the loneliness of his childhood, the wrong relationships, the feeling that he wasn't understood, that's what got him to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving a note behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the talkative and pure cleaner of the next apartment 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde) and the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Şebnem Sönmez) who lives in the opposite apartment, keep him talking.
They're approaching it as if it were a normal, normal process.
She's getting more and more tense, and she can't concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the three turns into a whirlwind when the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Kayanak from İpek Türk) joins in to clean his house.
In his typically naïve and candid way, 'Meltem' cannot help but sing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt takes on a different dimension when real estate agent 'Murat' (Kadir Chermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The singer Meltem's misinformation to the press is making things worse.
The song 'Sokak Kızı' by Nazan Öncel is also used in the game.
I'm going to the moon
For the first time, Usher managed to keep the pace and the flow of the game.
The comedy of the play is Zeynep Kankonde and Silk Turktan Kaynak.
The two are caricatured characters who manage to make the audience laugh with both their mimicry and their replicas.
While Sönmez translates the experience of the years very well, Deniz Çakır gives a convincing performance reflecting the depressed mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who made his name with his performance in Tolga Çelik's award-winning film 'Sarmaşık', is also successfully accompanying these four women.
The only sitcom that has been described as a comedy of the absurd promises to be laughed at without confusing the mind.
Mostly, I remember the beautiful words coming out of the mouth of 'Perran', played by Şebnem Sönmez: They read my writing in a hurry; they see it in a hurry, they live it.
All children have thought of dying to punish their parents, and they've always cried for some reason.
She's hanging in the air like some kind of misunderstood joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she's forgotten the most important part.
In fact, every story begins with some kind of abandonment.
I have to put my hands in my pockets sometimes, I can't stand things without pockets.
You're wondering where to put your hands.
The more we surprise, the more hands we have.
They speak of things they do not understand, and they invent.
A misunderstanding becomes a reality.
All women are confused because they're confused.
Since you can't die, you have a chance to live.
'Eat the Kafir and live long'
Safe to consume at any age
Expert Dietitian Pınar Kural Enç, who said that the main ingredient is milk but the more useful miracle food is kefir, which is one of the foods that can be consumed with absolute confidence at any age, "It is more nutritious than yogurt because it contains protein, essential minerals and vitamin B".
It's also rich in B1, B12 and vitamin K.
It's the foundation of a healthy nervous system, thanks to its calcium and magnesium content.
It's also a good source of phosphorus.
Kefir, which is also a tonic, also doesn't lose weight.
"The price is very high and my drink is easy to digest".
♪ The cure for all troubles
"Kefir is a regional drink made in the Caucasus", said Dietitian Pınar Kural Enç, who said that children, the elderly, pregnant women and women in menopause can consume kefir without any hesitation.
But now he's starting to make his name known to the world.
The secret of youth, the elixir of long and healthy life, kefir is almost a panacea.
And one of the most natural ways to keep your babies safe from metabolic diseases is to use kefir.
Friend of the intestines
This unique drink, with its endless benefits, is a friend to the intestines.
Our intestines contain between one and a half and two kilograms of bacteria and fungi.
The microorganisms in your digestive system are divided into two groups: beneficial and harmful.
Beneficial microorganisms are called 'probiotic microorganisms'.
Probiotics are as important as our liver, and when consumed in sufficient quantities, they prevent harmful microorganisms in our intestines from sticking to the intestinal wall and spreading.
The imbalance of healthy microorganisms in the gut leads to many diseases.
A healthy digestive tract must be maintained by proper nutrition.
And we should definitely consume enough probiotics for that.
It eliminates these problems in the uterus.
Kefir is the most potent probiotic bacteria, and the beneficial bacteria in it have a huge effect on strengthening the gut system.
It allows the beneficial bacteria and fungi in the gut to multiply in a healthy way and be useful.
With regular use of kefir, the intestines work, intestinal disorders disappear, swelling decreases and a healthier digestion is achieved.
A healthy gut is a healthy body, free of disease.
"Kefir is good for conditions such as appetite, insomnia, upper respiratory infections and allergies, and it also helps babies get better quality vitamins and minerals from food, so it plays an important role in baby nutrition", he said.

Gomez, the goat of the Pikestone
In the match between Beşiktaş and Mersin İdmanurdu, all eyes will be on the German footballer Mario Gomez.

Mersin Idmanyurdu, who completed the first half under the management of Bülent Korkmaz, parted ways with the 48-year-old technician on the day of the start of the inter-camp.
Hakan Kutlu, who replaced Korkmaz as the head coach of the red-and-white, was only at the helm of the team he had previously coached for one day.
During the period, an extraordinary general board was held and an agreement was reached with the technical director Nurullah Sağlam at Mersin İdmanyurdu, where Hüseyin Çalışkan was elected club president, but the 50-year-old coach was only in charge of the team for 2 days.

Emotional letters from tiny students
Letters from children in the west poured in to the police and soldiers who carried out terrorist operations in the area, including the center of Sur district of Diyarbakir.
The first is Aksaray 75.
The year started with the co-ordination of the students of the Istanbul West Ataşehir Natural Science High School and Eskişehir Atacağ Secondary School, including the Republican Primary School.
As a result of these studies, students in schools printed choreography on chocolate, creating the moon and stars, and then made nearly a thousand letters of poetry and paintings.
The children then sent their work to the Diyarbakir Police Directorate.
The Diyarbakır Police Department set up an exhibition about the work done by the children in the west.
The exhibition, which was set up in the new Police Directorate building, included the work of the students.
The exhibition was visited by the police officers and citizens who work in the building of the Security Directorate.
The letter and the pictures, with meaningful writings and poems, moved the readers.
A student who wrote a letter about the operations in Sur district said, "Dear police officers, we are grateful for the sacrifices you made to protect innocent people in Diyarbakir".
It's been learned that the exhibition will last until the end of next week.
He named his daughter 'Angela Merkel'
Another refugee baby has been named after German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has been criticized for her refugee policies.
Memun El Hamza, 26, and his wife Tema El Havar, 21, who managed to escape the war in Syria and reach Duisburg, Germany, named their first child "Angela Merkel".
Tema El Havar, speaking to the German press, said: "We are grateful to be here.
We named our daughter Angela Merkel to show that".
Memun Baba El Hamza said that "Germany has become like a mother for us".
This is the second Merkel.
It was learned that baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27th.
According to the German press, the tiny Angela Merkel, who weighed 3 kg 300 grams and was 55 centimeters tall, is in good health.
Last year, a refugee from Ghana named her daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees put up "Mother Merkel" banners in support of Merkel.
Consumer confidence in the US is at a seven-month high.
According to the university, UMICH is up 0.7 points to 93.3 points compared to the end of December.
As a result, the market expectation for the index, which reached its highest level since June 2015, was set at 92.9.
"Consumer confidence moved up to the fourth month of the year, as expectations for future economic growth improved", said Richard Curtin, Michigan's director of consumer research, in a written statement.
"Individual financing expectations remained at their highest level since 2007 due to weakness in inflation in general", he said.
The statement also included a forecast that consumer optimism would now depend on inflation remaining exceptionally low.
UMICH, which recorded its best annual performance since 2004 with an average of 92.9 last year, is determined by the results of a 50-question survey conducted with at least 500 people every month.

Putin licks his spit.
While Russia is preparing to grant Turkish companies the status of "can do business with Russia" if they cannot afford the services offered by Turkey by other means, the Russian Association of Tour Operators also made a statement that "Russian citizens do not give up Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculates that the severance of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new draft "Exceptional circumstances" for the Russian government regarding Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Federal Regulation, Turkish companies and firms will be allowed to do business with Russia even if they enter the sanctions area if necessary.
According to the draft, Turkish companies and firms can benefit from products and services in cases where it is impossible to provide them from other sources outside Turkey or domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs.
The mixed commission will be set up within the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia in partnership with other relevant ministries to determine which goods and services of Turkish origin will be included in this category.
So that he can decide which Turkish company can work with Russia, chosen by bureaucrats.
The same document also states that the Russian state bodies and private companies will have to prove to the commission that the work they will do with Turkish partners is not equivalent.
If the draft is approved by the Russian government and comes into force, the Turkish companies with privileges will also be registered in Russia.
The Association of Russian Tour Operators also said in a statement yesterday that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey.
The statement reads: "Despite the ban on the sale of tours and the advice of the Russian Foreign Ministry not to go to Turkey, our citizens started looking for the formula of organizing their holidays on their own".
The number of posts on social networks with the title 'The most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey' is growing like a thunder.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev described the drop in oil prices below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
Medvedev said, "It was a very bad surprise for our government, just as no one had thought that gasoline would drop to $30.
It seems that it will not be possible to implement the budget in its current form".
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
In the wake of the plane-crash crisis, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that economic sanctions will be further deepened.
In those days, our businessmen, who tried to go to Russia in the usual way, our staff at the border gates, were literally struggling.
Turkish goods are being hauled through customs, subjected to unthinkable controls.
It's not much more than a month, and yesterday Nerdun Hacıoğlu reports from Moscow.
Either way, the sanctions are getting soft.
But why?
The reason is very simple.
In an age of such economic globalization, the closing of the border gates with the methods of a century ago, the attempt to turn political conflicts into economic wars, is no longer possible.
Look, we're still writing about Iran and how the economic embargo that's been in place for years is being broken.
Two neighboring countries that seem to be very friendly, like Russia and Turkey, but in fact are not, are in need of each other.
It's not technically possible to take these two countries apart in one night, mixing businessman, tourist, entrepreneur, customer.
If you close the gates, the people of these two countries will be able to enter each other's country.
It is best to make political discussion and calculation at the table before sanctions create new Reza Zarrabs.
Without any disruption to the economy...

Sad news from Tyre: 1 martyr
Ali Bulduk, a police officer who was seriously injured in the explosion of a homemade explosive that terrorists had set up in Sur district, where the curfew continues on the 46th day, was taken to the Diyarbakır Army Hospital and was martyred despite all the interventions.
It was found that the city is registered in the population of Adana.
The Diyarbakir people did not support the terrorist act!
According to the information received, a protest against the operations was planned for the evening at 17.00 in front of AZC Plaza, located on Ekinciler Caddesi, Office district, Yenishehir district, Diyarbakır.
No one participated at the required level in the public outcry, where citizens were invited with leaflets and appeals.
While thousands of people have participated in the previous protests, the lack of support from the citizens has attracted attention recently.
The group, which failed to secure a sufficient majority in front of AZC Plaza, disbanded before it could carry out its actions because it did not receive support from Diyarbakır citizens.
Terrorists burned down a school in Diyarbakir
According to the information, the incident occurred in the Yunus Emre neighborhood of central Bağlar district at 1007th Street.
A group of masked terrorists who entered the Nuri Zekiye Has Middle School here at around 19.30 escaped after setting the building on fire, throwing molotov cocktails.
When the building caught fire, the surrounding citizens reported the situation to the fire department.
The fire department called the police, asking for security to allow them to enter the area.
A large number of police teams were dispatched to the area in armored vehicles.
Fire crews arrived at the school after security was taken, and they put out the fire before it engulfed the entire building.
Then, police teams were on the scene, and a multi-pronged effort was launched to capture the escaped terrorists.
On the other hand, some police officers who were on the scene helped the journalists to take the footage, while one police officer tried to prevent the journalists from taking the footage.
ATM thieves are in the wind.
Police teams affiliated to the İzmir Security Service started investigating the complaint of some people who had their bank card details copied and money was withdrawn from their accounts.
The police identified the perpetrators as M.M.G (43) and R.O (32) and determined that the suspects copied the card information of citizens with the help of the "card copying device" and "mini camera" that they placed in ATMs in different provinces of Turkey.
The suspects who learned the card codes were found to have been making transactions with these cards.
The operation was successful and the suspects were arrested.
Teams examining the laptops used by M.M.G. and R.O. have obtained numerous video recordings of the mini-cameras system, which was set up to capture passwords of citizens who transacted at ATMs, and have determined that the suspects stayed for a short time in the provinces they went to avoid being caught.
It was also revealed that the suspects made 50 thousand liras of unfair profit by copying the money from 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
The suspects were arrested after their actions in the security court.
The authorities warned citizens to regularly check their account movements against such events and to scroll with their hands during the entry of passwords in ATMs.
Netherlands: Assad should be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should be tried by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague.
Koenders, speaking at a conference in The Hague, said Assad was responsible for the influx of refugees.
Koenders noted that peace is not possible in Syria as long as Assad is in power:
Assad needs to be tried at the Hague.
A man with so much blood on his hands must answer to justice.
Assad is also solely responsible for the influx of refugees that we're facing right now.
Although I'm aware that Assad is not going to be leaving office anytime soon.
This issue needs to be addressed first, and we need Russia's help in that regard.
Protest against Burak Yilmaz
The 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, when Burak Yılmaz failed to reach the goal of the pass that he wanted to give to Sneijder, the protest whistles increased.
Burak Yılmaz reacted to the whimpering with a hand gesture.
Then the reaction increased, and whistles of protest were heard every time the ball came to the goalkeeper's feet.
Then some tribunes supported Burak Yılmaz and protested against fans who reacted to their own players in a meaningless way.
Then a large part of the crowd supported Burak Yilmaz.
No inconsistencies in Celtic
Deila will accept the Hoops are in a bad place and get over it, while Griffith doesn't care about the Celtics' inconsistency.
The battle of hearts, the SFA's punishment of Neilson and Warburton's reticence in the face of the January signings that shattered the team's unity,
The leaders don't have a point difference with Celtic.
ADAM Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a well-deserved victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie, and gave the Dons the chance to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the words "inconsistent".
Griffith pushes back the rumours of a disagreement at Celtic, and says he and his teammates were not bothered by any sense of increased scrutiny as they prepared to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The absence of the Scots' title race annoys the Dutch and the Boer.
Ronald de Boer, former Rangers midfielder and former international star of Dutch football, says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition with Rangers.
De Boer, now an Ajax ambassador, said: "They don't give Celtic game summaries in the Netherlands anymore, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People aren't just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old team.
They talk to each other when they talk to the teams, they're interested in this.
The old team's matches were tense, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch those games.
I'll make things right, she swore
Ronnie Deila has admitted that Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian boss has said he will turn back the tide.
The defeat against Malmö and the subsequent Champions League bye followed immediately afterwards, with the loss to the 10 man Aberdeen, who are now five points clear in the lead of the table.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had bad times in the past, and we're going to make a comeback".
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know that the situation is very disappointing and that many people are angry or sad about what happened.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January transfer shyness
Despite his comments just a couple of weeks ago that he had set some January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is holding off on signing, insisting that Ibrox don't want to upset the team.
His former Brentford coach said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
For players who come in the summer, there's a pre-season period where you get them used to it, and we saw that in our own group this season.
The crew is really good.
Sometimes it's more damaging to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic is targeting Michu for retirement.
Swansea forward Michu joined Celtic in the transfer window, and has ruled out any prediction that he could retire when his contract with the Swans expires.
At the age of 29, he suffered from a problematic ankle for two years, and couldn't find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
The hearts are ready for the SFA battle over Neilson's comments.
With Paterson out, the Hearts were 2-1 up and then down 3-2, but the defense's red card turned the whole thing upside down-- Collum's third red card to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson does not back down, insisting, "I never questioned the unit, I made no comment on the performance".
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessed Hibee was scolded after singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a bar in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh, in March 2014, prior to the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match and there was heat in that moment", said the striker, adding: "I can say this for sure, I'm not going to go to Tynecastle any more, except to play against Celtic.
Tannadice board has confidence in Dundee United management - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, Dundee United board still has confidence that the management team will fix things - but they agree that the slump on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We'll get the kids ready to go again", Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "ugly win" against Hamilton.
Derek Mclness admits that Aberdeen's team had to hold on to Hamilton Accies desperately to see them win their seventh consecutive league title, which took them five points above Celtic in the points table.
Mclnnes said: "There is no team that wins anything without winning matches in this format, whether it is cups or leagues".
While unemployment rates in England have risen, the same has been true for the Scots.
Whilst unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, the number of unemployed people in the UK rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show that Scotland's unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent, higher than the 5.5 per cent in England.
On the other hand, in Scotland, employment has fallen by 12,000 in three months, and now the number of people employed is 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent - above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Commenting on the latest figures, David Mundell, the Secretary of State for Scotland, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy".
It's been almost a full year since Scotland's historic decision to remain part of England.
In the 12 months since, we've seen improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Why I witnessed a hanging in Oklahoma
Later today, I'm gonna watch a man get killed by a late-night legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'm gonna be sitting in the gallery watching the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary as Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first extended through her best friend in January, and as shocking as it was, I accepted.
As that day came closer, I became more afraid of it.
And why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death sentence.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch executions in America, and since there are more practices than places, a terrible lottery is being played to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the media seats to five from 12.
Whoever is chosen will watch without being affected by emotion.
I can't do this
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've developed a relationship with him over the past few months through phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials told me that I couldn't be a witness and a reporter, so they wouldn't give me a pen and a notebook to record what I saw.
I'll try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me of compromising my neutrality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to him.
He agreed that he "could have said it better", but he still felt that what I did was wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with some of what I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the witness list whenever he wanted.
But he also wants an international reporter to be there to write it.
If he dies, he thinks that publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
I'll be joined by a reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware.
If you want to learn more about this, please listen to the podcast series I've prepared.
I'm not going to go into all the details here.
I have no idea if Richard Glossip is innocent.
Barry Van Treese's actions after his death are enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe that he is not guilty of murder.
I believe there is absolutely not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm gonna watch her die from that perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can check with the other reporters there.
The impression you get from me will be the same as the impression you get from someone who's watching the death of a man she likes, who was killed unnecessarily.
After a wet police chase, the man was persuaded to leave Canning River.
Canning Vale police officer was left paralyzed while he was trying to persuade the man to leave Canning River.
The alleged escape from a police car behind a Perth man ended with a police officer "gently persuading him to come back to shore" in shallow muddy water.
Canning Vale Police were called in to Beckenham on Tuesday for a break-in.
When they saw the suspect, the man tried to escape the police by entering the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"Senior Deputy Commissioner Shandell Castledine, he's standing in the water and he's saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me.'"
Police officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiation".
Senior Deputy Commissioner Castledine said "sometimes people try funny things to try to escape".
Ben Cousins, the football champion, is a living example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to escape a police alcohol control and attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts failed, but he inspired the local people to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon for fun.
Peter Moody claimed the stewards had spied on him and threatened to stop the race.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards of Racing Victoria tried to set up a scheme in their own stables last year and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the stewards and the unit department, and said they had conducted a personal campaign against her to have Lady Tatai disqualified from the race at the last pre-race luncheon on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always striving to do his best in racing, and the business told Lidari that when he tested positive for cobalt, he found himself in difficult circumstances that he could not explain.
He said he bit his tongue for 18 months in response to the allegations of snitching, not wanting to "look like a bunch of drunken grapes".
"I wasn't going to say this, and I covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get so mad and everything happens so fast", Moody said.
They know it's going on.
Sometimes you react and you suffer the consequences of that, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep well when I get home tonight.
I want to stand tall and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do the best I can for them.
When they start thinking I didn't do it, I shouldn't be coaching anymore.
I wonder what I'd do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had blasted a racing.com interview accusing the troop department of engaging in espionage at his barn.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'll call him if asked - and they offered him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in my stables", Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, they should all return their brooches because they weren't talented enough to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of RVL, David Moodie, new chairman of RVL, and the current CEO of RVL knew that then and they know it now.
Does that make me think it's getting personal?
RVL has a number of guns and maybe it wants to hold people other than the operators responsible for what's going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people outside think I am.
Maybe they need to take my license and kick me out, but I'm not sure what my words will make them think.
But I've come to the point where I don't care about anything, and that's what bothers me.
It really hurts me.
I'm gonna put pressure on them, make them responsible for making decisions.
I have my family's support and I'll walk.
The frustration of the operator's long-running cobalt investigation involving Lidari and the subsequent scratch incident led him to say, "Throw my license at the other end of the table".
Moody, who is best known for preparing the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race-day maintenance rule "ridiculous", saying that it was against the rules to apply mud or clay to the horse's feet.
It's against the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this".
One of my men accidentally slipped mud on his foot.
He could have gotten it last night.
Yesterday, which it did.
He took the day off.
Moody could face a three-month ban for using a spit on race day maintenance as a result of an investigation by the officials.
This is a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far", Moody said.
The hit-and-run driver in Cobram has been arrested.
Police arrested a man who hit a bike and ran off at the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
The police said the hit-and-run driver fled the scene before helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in at the police station in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with failing to stop for an accident, failing to assist and other traffic offenses.
The 40-year-old Cobram cyclist remains in stable condition in hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has given a tough answer to his rivals' allegations about the wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism aimed at his side as an effort to "set the agenda" for the NRL's two favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the judges allowed Storm to "wrestle" with his team in the semi-final match in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a rather unflattering reference to the Storm after the team's semi-final win over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling it a "hybrid" match for rugby league and saying that the two Oueenslanders were "not too big" in the wrestling.
Bellamy defended the team's struggle, saying that they were only focused on the "theme" while they were struggling.
Bellamy said that it was fueled by criticism of two top hockey teams, as it meant they were worried that Storm would beat them.
It's been going on - I didn't hear Trent Robinson mention wrestling when they beat us 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I guarantee you that we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or our techniques all year, but in the last six weeks alone, we've really emphasized our combat contacts, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there three years, and obviously he's coached a great team, and he's not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
Funny how it happened at this time of year.
Bellamy objected to Bennett's idea of "exciting football", reminding Bennett of his coach who won the 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons championship by playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He compared their game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and how exciting their game was".
I remember back in 2010, St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't give a rat's ass.
But now they have a team that plays what we call exciting football, and especially their speed and their young half.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have these types of players.
He made that point in 2010, and now everybody wants to play football that way -- every team doesn't have the halves like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can't play that way.
And that gives me a lot of confidence because they're talking like that because they're a little shy to play.
When they went to the big games, six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
Our game is 20-18, our game is more than two points scored, but exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut the offense but not make the score-capping offense?
That's my agenda.
If they're talking about us, it means we'll be meeting them here at some future date.
The Storm won't be hosting either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks this weekend, as they've earned the right to host Saturday night's AAMI Park final in the first game of the season, which is on sale Tuesday.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug offense
A man who was caught with 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland and faced a possible life sentence has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people arrested by federal police last month after tracking down 100 kilos of drugs from his Solay yacht, which had arrived in Coomera from South America via Vanuatu in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with his accomplices at the marina throughout the morning and later meeting them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Despite facing a potential life sentence for possession of a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he had attempted to possess all the drugs himself and that he may have been in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
The Chief Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has open ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently", he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his whereabouts in the public case.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather offered together $200,000 for his release on bail.
"It is clear from the sworn statements of both men that the bail amount of $200,000 is a real financial burden on them", Judge Flanagan said.
But he warned that this alone was not enough to keep him from a trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for surrendering both his Australian and Serbian passports, and for not going to the police station every day, and for obeying the curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phones to lure pedophiles into sending him pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request child abuse videos.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was asleep, logged into an online messaging service, and provided her with a series of inappropriate child images sent to her by another user.
The girl later woke up and realized she didn't have a phone, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She looked at him and immediately noticed the disturbing messages before warning her mother.
The police looked and saw five images, then analyzed the computers found at the address and discovered "relevant" search websites using terms to find indecent images of children.
Hogg later told officers that his reason for doing this was to "manage pedophiles" on the Internet and "act like a cop and scare them".
Eilidh Robertson, a representative for Mali, told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction - an addiction that scared people.
He admitted that the calls were made by a computer, but he said he did it to act like a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations between the unknown person who sent him the pictures and the one who asked him to send more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said that when he drank, he had sick ideas and wanted to watch the rape and murder scenes.
Ms. Robertson added: "When she found the messages on her phone, she was screaming and calling her mother and she was shaking and crying.
The mother saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and the accusations followed.
The girl was interviewed and she said that she used the computer and the Playstation to look younger than the defendant.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of the offences of taking or producing indecent images of children on 14 June last year, breach of bail on 25 January this year and failure to appear in court on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said that Hogg should not be included in the category of sexual offences, as it is debatable whether there is "a specific sexual element" in the offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed the case until October, when the social background report will be released.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but has been kept under guard for other extraordinary cases.
There was a sex offender registry before the sentencing date.
In Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe made the wrong speech in Parliament.
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest leader, fell down a flight of stairs earlier this year as he walked down a podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of him falling went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was marred by allegations that opposition MPs had received anonymous death threats while Mr Mugabe was speaking.
Last month, in his address to the nation in parliament, he was booed and interrupted repeatedly - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), revealed that seven opposition politicians had received messages on their cellphones asking them not to disturb him during Mr Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the journalists are getting a message from an unseen number, but it's called 'death.'"
He tells the members that their immunity is valid inside the parliament and that immunity doesn't work when they leave the parliament.
The chief spokesperson expressed "concern" over threats against politicians of the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in an effort to restructure and cut costs in its corporate services business.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating its computer and printer businesses from the company's faster-growing hardware and services operations.
HP said in a statement that the expected layoffs would result in an estimated cost of $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
HP's president and CEO Meg Whitman, who will head the post-separation unit, said "these restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company".
"Whitman said Hewlett Packard would be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we would have a broad and deep portfolio to help companies transition to the new way of doing business".
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
According to a statement from the company, Hewlett Packard Corporation will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will focus on providing "unrivalled integrated technology solutions" for companies.
His garage in Palo Alto is the birthplace of Silicon Valley, and he's splitting the company, which was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment.
HP is undergoing a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's largest PC maker and one of the largest tech companies in the US, is one of the latest moves in the industry's belief that firms with a tight focus perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere's injury before the Dinamo Zagreb game has caused problems for his teammates.
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, and that there was no reason for him not to play during the Christmas period.
The best-case scenario is that Wilshere will miss at least four matches in England, and looking back at his record, it's as uncertain as whether he'll be in the European Championship next spring.
The most embarrassing aspect of the final problem is that Wilshere finished last season strong after suffering a separate ankle injury, and then he's looking for his pre-season sharpness.
"A disabled career is not threatening", Wenger said.
This is a bone that's not fully healed.
It's not a big deal.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his wrists or any previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, that may be true, but as Wenger will admit, there is a risk that a player who makes a comeback mid-season could be injured further.
There's also a disturbing pattern developing.
According to research by Premier Injury Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different medical conditions recorded since his debut six years ago.
He's only played in 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the last five seasons.
In the big picture, Arsenal are one of two First Division teams to have lost six of their eight seasons, most of them due to injury, since 2007-08.
Wenger has acknowledged the potential for a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believe they will continue to recover from their injury record last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a period of exposure to injury, a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight", Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get through this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust that, and I believe he'll have the career he deserves.
Arsenal, who will start the Champions League battle against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, have Chelsea to play on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur to play next Wednesday, and Wenger is preparing the team for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta will be playing.
Wenger can start with Nacho Monreal and Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players the breath they need", Wenger said.
Despite being one of Arsenal's open favourites in Group F, Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most feared stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo are undefeated after producing their own "Namaliglup" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
This is the tenth tremor in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned their lesson from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and remains motivated with the long-term goal of bringing the club its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous", says Wenger.
That's never happened at the Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm experienced enough to be realistic.
We are passionate, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that gives us some serious lessons about male friendship
The lack of similar portals in the program is remarkable, especially at a time when men need more to open up and when the suicide rate among young men is at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 years, and it was three times more common in men than in women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Campaign Against Living in Misery (CALM) has declared 2015 the Year of the Man, and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
At the heart of the struggle to accomplish this difficult task is friendship.
A study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that those who suffered from the condition were twice as likely to recover if they had a high number of friends in "health mode".
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends can halve the mental challenges that might arise.
But of course, for friendship to work, it has to be accessible.
In this age of social media-heavy communication, the focus on style over content makes it more important to respond immediately than to communicate meaningfully.
Our digital lives have doubled our need to appear as strong, fun-loving, successful people, when in reality, everything is about isolation.
Artificial success is dominated by what psychologists call externally driven values -- money, image, social status -- and in the pursuit of these, the inner values that have the most profound impact on our mental health -- our inner longing for personal growth and companionship -- are consumed.
Money can't buy more happiness, as a billionaire video game creator recently explained.
The beauty of Friends was that it turned this focal point upside down.
The characters were defined not by their work but by their personality, and they revealed that through their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the minutes they spent in their comfortable chairs watching football, Ross's fondness for Rachel, all stemmed from the knowledge that men, even if they're lagging behind in fully articulating their feelings, can actually relate to them.
A supportive worker told me, "... listening to depressed and suicidal people, I saw how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference".
Most of the men we've been in contact with can't talk to their friends.
"The feeling of being 'too late' is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness".
One of the shows that comes to mind when I suggest long-term coping mechanisms is Friends.
He emphasized the small moments of his boyhood.
My goal is to help people in their moments of distress, but the long-term support comes from family and friends with a close personal network.
And if you're attending FriendsFest this weekend at Comedy Central, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful setting where the scenes are being redesigned for celebration?
Or, even better, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You have no idea what your friendship will do to make a difference.

Di Maria's goal made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal for Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easy for PSG to overtake rivals with a goal against Swedish side Malmö in the opening match of the Champions League on Tuesday.
Here's the match report and the match reactions.
With Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani on target, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League battle with a comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria's goal four minutes into the game allowed the French champions to continue their run in the Champions League, but they did not seize their opportunities until Cavani's second goal in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in the group with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed to make a strong start against the Swedish champions, not only to get out of the qualifying group but also to improve their quarter-final performances in the last three championships.
But their scoring game was not the best of the season for Laurent Blanc's side, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positioning around the penalty area and was later sidelined against his hometown team, with whom he had started his illustrious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the Champions League, both on and off the field, so a 2-0 win will create problems for our opponents and it's a good start to give a comfortable image behind the scenes, although there are some things we need to improve during the season", Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
We wanted to win, and we won, even though I was sorry we didn't score more goals, or two.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after the injury with one of three player changes made in the 2-2 draw against Bordeaux at the end of the week in Ligue 1, but was overshadowed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was seen as the player who would take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was transferred from Manchester United last month, and he proved that those who thought so were not wrong when he ran behind the Malmö defense in Marco Veratti's pass and sent Johan Wiland to the wings with a beautiful shot from the far corner.
However, everyone was disappointed when they saw PSG win a big victory.
In order to get through this round, Malmö, who had eliminated Celtic in the play-offs, lined up with nine international players, a five-man defence and two deep midfield players, a heavy opponent.
In the 34th minute, they made very few attacks, except for Nikola Djurdjic's shot that broke the corner post that Kevin Trapp was guarding.
On the other hand, PSG allowed them to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and ineffective last shots, Ibrahimovic failed to make the final move in at least five attacks in the first half and when the second half began, he was disappointing by not keeping up with Cavani's play.
However, when it came to organising his team-mates, Ibrahimovic was more skilled, as in the 52nd minute he gave the pass of the foul ball that Di Maria sent to Wiland's fortress.
The second goal came an hour after the full, thanks to Cavani, who scored his sixth goal of the season with Maxwell's head-on left-wing after Ibrahimovic's pass.
After Malmö's return to the match was exhausted and the goal from Ezequiel Lavezzi, who entered the game later, was not counted, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's free-kick and did not allow the score to change.
Later, Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG were a class superior to his own team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year".
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish League, which is not the same level as him.
The equipment in the hand is not enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore has $ 2.5 billion in revenue from stock sales.
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore was hit by falling commodity prices and raised $2.5 billion by selling its shares on Wednesday as part of a plan to split its debt.
Glencore, listed in London, has announced that it has sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, has been hit hard by falling commodity prices as China's economic slowdown has caused a surge in demand and caused confusion in markets.
The rights issue has caused Glencore's share prices to rise on the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The stock has risen 0.69 percent to jump 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index.
Glencore last week announced a $2.5 billion stock sale as part of its plans to reduce its $30 billion debt load by a third.
The company sold its new shares at 125 pence a share, a 2.4 percent discount to Tuesday's close.
He sold his 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about China's long-standing growth have cut the price of iron ore by roughly half, while coal, copper and other commodities have fallen between 20 and 40 percent.
The White House has confirmed Xi Jinping's visit to Washington.
The White House confirmed Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay an official visit to the United States later this month.
The statement said that Xi's first official trip to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a return visit to Barack Obama, who visited Beijing last November.
After the two heads of state's bilateral meetings, the President of the United States and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
The statement also emphasized that "President Xi's visit will expand U.S.-China cooperation on regional and global issues as well as bilateral relations and will allow President Obama and President Xi to constructively address issues over which they have disagreements".
The visit, first announced in February, is expected to take Xi to Seattle before Washington, where he will meet with some US technology leaders, and then travel to New York City to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address some contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about allegations of Chinese cyber espionage and China's claims to sovereignty in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon makes diversity in filmmaking seem trivial.
Matt Damon has spoken out against African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying that it's not necessary to be behind the camera during a debate about diversity.
In the Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight on HBO, Brown broke the veteran actor's promise when he stressed the need for alternative perspectives on the project's black lead character in the script's chosen scenario.
Damon argued that when we talk about diversity, you don't do it in the cast of the show, you do it in the cast of the movie.
Shocked, Brown responded to the actor's comments in the Martian film by saying, "Oh, wow, okay, that's against it".
Damon and Brown were brought together by co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists for the show.
Brown said, "First, I wanted to get people thinking about how they would treat the Adaptation character, whoever the director was".
The only black character is a prostitute who was shot by a white gossip columnist.
The producers of Dear White People insisted that finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio be given the rights to direct the film, to which Damon responded that the assignments "may not turn out the way we want".
After the debate aired, there was an outpouring of displeasure on social media with Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the cut, writing, "Matt Damon can explain his diversity about this person by saying that the only black person in the room is white AND it hurts".
The tweet got 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes after it was posted.
Damon's comments came at a time when the issue of racial justice in the media was at the forefront of social debate.
After the 2014 killing of a young white police officer named Michael Brown, the Black Lives Matter movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and authorities nationwide to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince spoke up-close about the movement when announcing the Album of the Year nominees at the Grammy Awards.
He said the albums still matter.
Books and black lives are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to a question from Fox News's Elisabeth Hasselbeck, whether the group should be considered a hate group.
The leaders said the Black Lives Matter Network is a group of love.
It was recently announced that Damon was included on a list of entertainers, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the definition of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's not clear whether he accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
The first champion of the American Ninja Warrior has been crowned.
Professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero won the American Ninja Warrior program Monday night, becoming the first athlete to win $1 million.
Now entering its seventh season, the event has never seen a competitor complete all the stages of the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to make it to the final round.
The last task was to climb a rope of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the course in time, and thus became the first athlete to complete the challenging stage 4 of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero won by finishing the course three seconds ahead of him.
After this hard-fought victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News about the shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! about his huge pay raise, "I think it's great to even think about it, I've never made more than $10,000 a year or lived on it".
I mean, it happened in a moment, I can't imagine how it could happen, the future is unknown.
Producer Kent Weed also spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why no awards will be given, even though Britten was the first contestant to finish the show.
The rules say the money goes to the quickest.
Weed said, "If there's more than one, the one who finishes it fastest wins the prize".
And while the money is a great prize and a life-changing one, he also won a big jackpot.
I don't think he has any ill will about it.
He's very happy to do what he did.
He got tons of compliments from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If anyone's going to beat me, I'm happy it's Isaac".
I think Isaac would have thought the same if they'd changed roles.
American Ninja Warrior has renewed for an eighth season, and filming will begin in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have just beaten the Minnesota Twins by a landslide.
MINNEAPOLIS -- The second half of the season hasn't been a very pleasant one for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, once the best in baseball, are now in the bottom half of the American League Central.
The Tigers, who have reduced their game to a shambles, played a perfect game on Tuesday, beating the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins have now overtaken the Houston Astros by half a point, and have lost their chance to advance to the American League Second wild-card round.
For Detroit, it was a return to a good game that's rarely seen, even for one night, for most of the second half of the season.
In the words of Tigers manager Brad Ausmus, "victory is fun, no matter what".
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon scored three runs in Detroit's first two at-bats to show off his early offensive support, and he scored runs in the sixth and ninth.
Simon (13-9) made six 3-1 shots, three of which were runs.
That's only the third quality start in the last nine laps.
"I just want to finish the year strong", Simon said.
It's hard for the rest of us to throw every game, so I wanted to dive in.
The Tigers' star pitcher, Victor Martinez, has three hits and two runs, his first RBI since mid-August.
This was the first of three consecutive nights on this side of Martinez's four-hit game win against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He shook the stick hard", said Ausmus.
He looked good, and he was already noticeably better in BP, which he maintained in the game.
The Twins, who had three runs in the bottom of the seventh, had their best chance of getting back in the game.
Midfielder Byron Buxton has doubled to the left field line to begin the batting order.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks could only manage a slow stroke, and Simon caught second-guy Brian Dozier to make a shot as he swung before he lifted for left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Mauer, the only player who could take on Miguel Sano, the right-winger who outplayed Drew VerHagen by two runs, has come out boldly.
In the second tie-breaker, with a pair of runners, VerHagen managed to draw third baseman Trevor Plouffe into the double.
Plouffe's shot to the D.P. was his 27th in the majors this season.
After Detroit struggled for a run that would guarantee ninth, Mauer overtook RBI and opened the gap with the Tigers, closing in on Bruce Rondon, 5-4.
However, the right fifty-fifth was caught by Sano in three throws for a save.
Detroit took advantage of an early exit by Phil Hughes, who had lost his form.
The Tigers won three runs in the first two at-bats against a newly recovered right-hander who's been out of the game for over a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously, it's not the game I want to play", Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable throughout and I was able to make some pretty good shots on the third shot".
With a first down, Hushes took second baseman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
Two shutouts by right fielder J.D. Martinez left Victor Martinez with one out in the first inning of the game.
Victor Martinez in the scoring position raced with runners to cross the 0-21 band.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a one-hit right, another run was winning, but Victor Martinez was out for a third, so the threats were over.
The Tigers added a second, an outsider from catcher James McCann and a two-out from center fielder Anthony Gose to make the score 3-0.
The Twins' manager, Paul Molitor, said it was "a big hit".
He didn't hit it very well, but he hit it right.
Hughes, who was the leading scorer, threw three scoreless innings until he was replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Achter.
Hughes was charged with three runs scored and four strikeouts in six at-bats.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez has been ruled out of the game due to a shoulder injury he used to throw.
He'll be seen by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the disabled list since mid-August due to shoulder pain, was scheduled to begin work Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the Twins will be facing LHP Daniel Norris DL.
In four games since the July 30th game for David Price, the Tigers are 1-1 with Norris.
He hasn't played since August 20th because of the pain in his right side.
The Tigers and the Twins will conclude their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), who was the top-seeded pitcher in the Eastern Conference, will face Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open up the economy to the world more
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding reforms that the economy needs to open more to the outside in order to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Central Leading Group meeting to strengthen overall reforms, the Chairman said, "China should develop its opening-up policies by attracting foreign investment expertise".
Xi encouraged opening up, saying that new reforms would bring new energy and vitality and create a new space for economic growth.
The leader group adopted a series of recommendations, such as a negative list regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to incorporate private capital, and revising the registration system for settlers.
According to the statement, a negative list will be prepared, identifying the sectors and business lines that are prohibited for investment.
The system will be tested and improved through pilot programs.
This is an important move, because it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources and will make the market more transparent by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also loosen its control over the companies, allowing them to run their own businesses.
The statement also states that China will explore new cross-border economic cooperation models in border areas and put in place new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More space will be opened to private investment to open up state-controlled sectors.
The statement said, "the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment, and will provide better services to foreign-funded companies by protecting their interests".
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residence permits or "green cards" will be optimized and the application processes simplified.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the rights of lawyers to practice and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
A statement released after the meeting said that Premier Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
Miniature bags are very fashionable now- Times Magazine Saturdays
In the world of fashion, the road goes round and round and comes to the bag.
The trend that's been coming up lately is miniatures...
It is also possible to say that the small bags attached to the larger ones attract attention.
They say the small things are beautiful.
I guess that's the same view as bags.
As they were walking down the street with suitcases, the wind began to blow in the opposite direction, and the suitcases began to shrink.
We had the small bags, but this time they came in a smaller version of the big handbags.
These tiny bags can only hold your phone, credit card and key.
The movement that began with Céline and Hermès spread with Prada.
The change from a fan of handbags to a fan of miniatures has also affected the new models.
Loewe has introduced this season's fun bags in two sizes.
Of the panda, polar bear, and elephant bags, the most elephant-like ones stand out.
The mini size of the large bags that luxury brands offer with the phenomenal names seems to have attracted the most red carpet celebrities again.
The Birkin bag, made by Hermes in honor of Jane Birkin, is one of the most popular.
Although Jane Birkin said in a press release that she didn't want her name associated with a bag, that's how it's being remembered now.
And fashion weeks have led to the mini-bag movement.
Mini bags are also prominent on the podium.
They're so tiny, you can't really put them on your arm.
They can be used with long hangers and cross-hatches.
But we've seen those long suspenders on the runway wrapped around the wrists of the models.
Fendi is one of those who takes the mini-suitcase thing to the next level.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in a mini-suitcase but can't give them up.
Big bags are friends with mini bags.
How is it?
By turning mini bags into bag ornaments that can be attached to their larger counterparts.
This presentation, which has been taking center stage, is quickly gaining ground on the street.
Let's see what else we can see!
Changing skin in the denim
Turkey is at the level to compete with the world brands in denim.
And this experience, which he gained in production, he now enriches with design.
The loft is one of them.
We see the black models that used to be a few, now starting to take their place on the shelves every season.
In this season of black power, the denim has found its best friend.
Leather goods and leather detailing stand out as the rebel's friend.
Short models with zippers, generally called "motorbikes", are in vogue.
The strong air of the leather is complemented by black fabrics, while long blouses and sparkling sweaters give the sport a sleek look.
In the old days, young people would wear denim and like to disappear in the crowd.
It was supposed to save the day.
Now, young people want to wear a piece that emphasizes elegance as much as it's comfort.
So, in this sense, Loft has a good understanding of his target audience, with the collections and the complementary pieces that he's created.
Small for Banksy, big for global
The world premiere of the "The Art of Banksy" collection, which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, has been held in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which is the product of the artist's 15 years of work and in which 85 original works are brought together for the first time, is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul opened the day before at Global Karaköy (Rıhtım Caddesi).
The world-famous artist, who hid his identity and used pseudonyms, was of course not at the opening.
We don't know if he's ever been to Istanbul.
But according to the exhibition's curator Steve Lazaridas, Bansky doesn't even know about the exhibition.
There's no reason to ask her permission.
Because old friends Bansky and Lazaridas have parted ways after 12 years.
Some of the works on display are Lazaridas's, some are collectors' pieces.
But there are issues that Bansky's followers are concerned about.
What would Banksy think of the exhibition "The Art of Banksy", which brought together 85 of his works?
What if he saw the little shop at the end of the 800-square-meter gallery space?
Would it have been a good idea for her work to be printed on diaper bags, wallets, necklaces, and to draw attention to the world's wounded issues like Red Balloon Girl, Cleaner, Rose Now?
It's disappointing for the fans of Banksy that the exhibition of an artist with anarchist spirit, who hides his identity, has become such a consumer product.
Not at all Banksy's style.
But you still have to buy a limited number of tickets before they run out!
The big show for Banksy, the small, globalized world, "The Art of Banksy", is on view through April.
They are vile, cruel.
Let them dig a ditch.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the communique.
Erdogan said, "These are the tyrants, these are the low".
And whoever is with the wrongdoers - they are the wrongdoers.
"They have committed the same crime because they were with the people who committed the murder".
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who placed a curtain on the site of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "I have shared our sorrow with both the German President and the Chancellor of Germany that 10 of our German friends died in this action in Sultanahmet Square, which is a peaceful square that smells of history and culture - especially in the immediate vicinity of the German Fountain - in such an area.
I would like to convey my condolences to the German people, especially to the families of the dead".
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination", he said.
Reacting to the academics who signed the statement, Erdoğan said: "I condemn again and again the academics who stood up against all these terrorist incidents and issued a black statement and put their signature behind those massacres".
It's not a matter of knowing who our people are, who they are, more than just being a professor or an associate professor.
These are dark people.
Those are the unjust, those are the wicked.
They have committed the same crime, because they were with those who committed the massacre.
And in the incident in Çinar, where will these capricious academics put those puppies, that 3-year-old Mevlüde who was martyred with his father?
How do they have a conscience to be with his killers?
I call upon all the judiciary, the senate of the universities, to take action against these acts, contrary to our constitution and laws.
Yesterday, I said that the steps that need to be taken must be taken quickly.
Whatever they're gonna do, they can do it there.
Those who want to make politics, make it in Parliament.
But if they can't do it in Parliament, then they can go and dig a ditch or climb a mountain.
I'm being so clear and direct.
TEOG results announced
The results of the Transition System from Basic Education to Secondary Education (TEOG) examination for 8th classes organized by the Ministry of National Education (MEB) were announced.
The results of the exam, which was held on November 25-26, are finally in.
Weighted Common Examination Score: Under Common Examinations, the scores obtained from the subjects that the test is taken are multiplied by their weighting coefficients.
The value obtained from the sum of the multiples is obtained by dividing the sum of the weight coefficients of the lessons by the periodically weighted common exam score for each term.
The arithmetic mean of the periodically weighted common test scores forms the weighted common test score.
The scoring is done on a total of 700 points.
The basic score for placement is the 6th, 7th and 8th grade year-end achievement scores plus the 8th grade weighted common exam score.
The total score is divided by two to determine the score for each position.
Scoring is based on 500 full points.
Teaching staff members are marked at their doors.
At the Faculty of Communication at Gazi University, a leaflet was posted on the door of some of the faculty members' rooms, saying "We don't want the PKK supporting...... at our university".
And under the paper, the words "Gazi Communications"... are added.
The 'Academics for Peace Initiative' group, which signed the 'We will not be partners in this crime' statement, received numerous reactions from 1128 academics, including President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and government officials.
Academics who were investigated for their signature were detained and removed from office.
At Gazi University Faculty of Communication, some faculty members had signs posted on the door of their rooms saying "We don't want PKK-supporting students in our university".
And under the sheet, it says "blood connection"...

'I found 26 while searching for two wrestlers'
The second documentary by Mete Gümürhan "Young Pehlivanlar", 66.
It was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February).
Gümürhan, who is originally from Edirne but has a production company in the Netherlands, explained why and how he filmed the documentary, which he completed shooting in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Wrestlers", which tells the story of six boarding school students from Amasya who aim to become world champions in wrestling, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Guard, the first Turkish documentary selected for this category, is one of the nominees for the Crystal Bear award.
Although born and raised in the Netherlands, he is originally a director from Edirne, Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a kid, he came to Turkey for his summer vacation, and he heard his grandfather tell greasy wrestling stories and watched wrestling matches.
"There are no only political problems in Turkey".
I wanted to tell the world what else was happening in Anatolia.
"For example, wrestling is unfortunately not very well known among our ancestors", he wants to get together with six directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project remains inconclusive, but one day the news of the magazine he read on the plane opens the door to another project for Gümürhan.
'We stayed at the sugar factory'
Following the article about two young brothers, 10 and 11 year old wrestlers, Mete Gümürhan goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The kids' father won't allow the filming of the documentary.
Gürümhan explains how he overcame this challenge: "I spent the whole day thinking about what I could do.
Because the support from the Ministry of Culture could be withdrawn".
Dad mentioned in the interview a boarding school in Amasya where the kids would go.
I'm thinking about going there.
When I was looking for two kids, I found 26 kids who were interested in wrestling at school.
We started shooting within a week and we finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed in the sugar factory's dormitory".
The documentary, which was shot in three weeks, was the director's biggest challenge.
Gümürhan, who said that three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign director and the sound engineer worked, said, "I didn't know what I would encounter while shooting".
"They didn't know Turkish either", he says.
The Young Rangers focuses on the story of six of the 26 child wrestlers.
Baran, who was raised by his grandfather and has a weight problem, Harun, who can't attend training because he broke his arm, Beytullah, who is ambitious but has health problems, the school's cute boy Umit, the youngest champion Ahmet and the one who keeps the group together, Muhammad...
"I let them be completely natural", says Gümürhan, describing her work with children.
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I shot the first week and a half of training.
I wanted the kids to pretend the cameras weren't there.
"Thankfully, they adapted quickly".
It was a surprise to be chosen for Berlin.
Mete Gümürhan said that he did not expect that the Young Pehlivan would be selected for the Berlin Film Festival, "We were ready but it was a surprise to be selected for Berlin".
The Young Guns is not a sports documentary, it's a show about the struggles of children and their lives.
"I wanted to bring to the forefront the stories of children with family problems, their struggles to find their identity and to cope with their problems", she says.
Supporting artists and academics
The storm that broke out yesterday after the announcement of the "Academics for Peace Initiative" has led to the opening of investigations and detentions of academics, while on the other hand, there are statements of support.
Initial support came from literary figures, including many famous names.
The day before, the filmmakers, and yesterday, the theater people, they announced their support.
In a statement signed by 138 theatre artists, "We, as artists working in the field of theatre and performing arts, stand with this honorable gathering of Academicians who call for peace, and declare that we stand with freedom of expression, equality, the right to life and unconditional peace".
"We join with our conscience and heart the call of the academics for negotiation and peace".
More than 400 filmmakers, including Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yilmaz, Onur Ünlü, Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik, said: "We are on the side of the free thought and art.
Without 'but' without 'if': "We will not be partners in this crime!"
We support the initiative of the Academics for Peace".
The Society of Cinematographers (SIYAD) also made a statement saying "We stand with the academics who have been targeted by the lynching campaign".
The Peace Academics Initiative (AAP) issued a statement on January 11 in Ankara and Istanbul, calling on the government to negotiate peace and peace with simultaneous statements, "We are not partners in this crime".
The text was signed by 1,128 academics from 89 universities, as well as thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar, who are world-renowned for their theories and books.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoglu sharply criticized the academics' statement as "supporting terrorism" and called on Erdoğan to "do his duty".
Following this call, some universities terminated the work of academics, while the prosecution initiated a resen investigation.
Yesterday, a number of academics were detained.
I'm a fan, please help!
The red hair of Hürrem Sultan, the nose of Beren, the hair of Justin...
While it's normal to work like a bum, it's a psychological disorder once it starts to affect your entire life.
Celebrity worship syndrome, or the other term, celebrity worship syndrome, is a topic that's already been discussed in academia around the world, but it's just recently been discussed here.
It's only natural that he'd run into a hair salon with a famous photograph of a lady.
But don't forget the year of the "Sultan of the Swallows" when all the teenagers were running around Ireland with red hair.
It's already been reported that the 'Beren nose' has been involved in the cosmetic operations we left behind in 2015.
It's not much different on the gentleman's side.
There was a time when it was considered impolite to dress like a Polat Alemdar.
Now a wind of controversy is blowing in.
We're surrounded by Justin Bieber-like boys.
So much so that the unnecessary information we quoted has been read thousands of times on the Internet: "First, when you go to the barber, trim the sides of your hair, the top of your ears and the sides of your hair, to the top of your head".
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting process is complete, you should shave your hair with a little water.
After the shaping process is complete, fix your hair with the help of a spray.
"Justin, you have to shape while it's still moist to get hair".
This all brings to mind the recent celebrity worship syndrome, which is already an academic subject in the world.
Celebrity fans are like love pools for us.
Artists brag about their fan numbers, how much they impress them.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it that simple.
It's a debate, especially for teenagers, about what celebrities decide to eat, drink, listen to, and wear.
Excessive attachment to names that are presented as unattainable is defined as a role model mental illness.
Psychologist Sümeyye Demir admits that Turkey is behind in the field of psychology.
But she also notes that families are slowly becoming aware: "One of the fundamental issues of psychological science is that people find peace with themselves, peace within their own identity".
Back in the day, kids filling their rooms with posters, dressing up as someone, it wasn't taken seriously.
That's changing now.
The stepfather feels the need to intervene.
"A passionate attachment to someone is a sign that something is wrong in a young person's life".
Fans on the emotional roller coaster
The interest in the Unlu is harmless, provided it is not excessive.
Demir suggests paying attention to the signs of not wanting him to marry, being jealous of his wife, preferring her style of clothing.
We're talking about people who are famous.
It's normal to wonder about them, to be annoyed by their lives.
But the youngsters who miss the point of the cantara, says the psychologist, are mostly: "When there are no names in the family or in the environment to represent the child in terms of virtue, good behavior, that gap is certainly filled".
Not always good examples.
"He's copying the mysteries, too, kid".
When we ask how to approach them, the Slumdog Millionaire starts by reminding us that celebrity obsessive disorder is more common in adolescence.
Given that adolescents can be self-defeating, the problem is easier to conceal.
We are faced with young people who complain about the limitations of their families, but also seek support and affection: "We have to take into account their emotional ups and downs".
New research suggests that they're being challenged by changes in their brains.
"The young man who enters the emotional high-speed train "and becomes passionately attached to someone, "should be treated with natural, gentle care".
Behaviors can be changed
Psychologist Sümeyye Demir reminds parents of the tasks they have to overcome the superstition syndrome:
Recognize his emotional distress, make sure you're calm before you get involved.
Never let it overwhelm your feelings.
To encourage independence, let him know that you respect his admiration.
Instead of teaching by reproaching, set a good example by discussing names that will be role models for him.
Try to figure out the celebrity's place in our daily lives together.
It would be good to read books together about the real world of celebrities.
Make sure you're communicating in an adult-adult format.
Remember, addiction and motivation run the same pathways in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are opportunities for change, and accept him for who he is.
You should get professional help with your fancy.
The angry and the envious are admiring
The core of celebrity-worship syndrome is the need to seek help and support from others.
Unconditional love is a cry for help.
But unfortunately, it's not perceived that way.
And it's so pervasive that it's impossible to limit it to one country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoglu points out that there are well-known names in every country that occupy the television.
The syndrome is more about being attached to these celebrities, "They're extraordinary".
The vast majority don't have their means.
And those who do, don't live by acting like them.
Or they didn't adopt or they didn't dare.
"But those who have no means, or those who have, continue to watch with a sense of unease".
The envious or the nervous viewers are the same.
They both have a deep admiration.
They make easy money, they're on the magazine's agenda.
It's enough to know that to increase your fan base.
Another advice from expert psychologist Sümeyye Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It should not be overlooked that artificial life is involved.
For someone who's passionate about fame, that's where the support of the community comes in.
But he's adamant that his celebrity fan has problems just like him.

Should I have a gallbladder operation?
Dr. Fevzi Özgönül is answering questions in his corner of the Meydan Gazete.
I have a gallstone and every morning when I wake up, I go to the bathroom 2 or more times a day with stomach pain after meals.
Could that be what's keeping me from losing weight?
I've been using it on a sliding scale lately, but I'm not losing any weight, I'm not losing any food.
I've been like this since I was a kid.
What do I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
ANSWER: Gallstones are often accompanied by an infection.
These complaints of abdominal pain that develop immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, your gallbladder is narrowed and your inflamed gallbladder is emptying into your intestines.
The intestines, which are upset by inflamed bile, quickly try to expel the bile.
That's why you go to the bathroom so often.
And because you're in the bathroom so much, your food is being eaten and you're losing weight so slowly.
I think you should have this treated.
If you go to a gastroenterologist and they diagnose what I'm talking about, you can get rid of it with antibiotics.
But eventually, you may have to have gallbladder surgery.
The alkaline probiotic may alleviate your symptoms a little, but it won't.
I say keep using the alkaline probiotic, no matter what.
Because this probiotic powder is the greatest aid to your weight loss.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
Sir, when I'm stressed and angry, I eat too much and gain weight.
How do I deal with this?
ANSWER: An overeating is an inability to meet energy needs.
This could be because of a low-fat diet or skipping breakfast and lunch.
Another reason is that you can't digest the food you eat.
It requires a healthy digestive system.
If you don't have ulcers, cold sores or anything like that, the easiest way is to take a good probiotic.
You'll see the benefits.
I can't gain weight, doctors don't know why
Your corner usually has information for weight loss.
It all makes sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't seem to gain weight.
And more importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors say nothing.
A: The techniques we use are not just for weight loss, but to restore the physiological functioning of the body to its ideal size.
Obesity and weakness are the same kind of ailments.
Weight loss in obesity and weight loss in weakness are treated with the same technique.
And you're gonna be even weaker when you eat sweet and pastry.
I think you've figured that out by now.
You can be stimulated by carboxypoints and gain weight by eating healthy.
So you've lost weight and lost your ideal body.
Our other patients have also lost their ideal body weight by gaining weight.
You'll achieve your ideal body by gaining weight, and they'll achieve their ideal body by losing weight.
If the system problem goes away, you gain weight, they gain weight.
But first, the system needs to work properly.

On the night of the awarding of successful women, Barış Arduç, the most talked about male actor of the recent period, was awarded the title of the Inspirational Man of 2015.
The previous evening, at the award ceremony held at the Shangri-La Bosphorus Hotel, the Journalist of the Year Ezgi Başaran, the Entrepreneur of the Year Buse Terim, the Writer of the Year Şebnem Burcuoğlu, the Woman of the Year Elif Genceli Güner, the Singer of the Year Demet Akalın, the Artist of the Year Lara Melda Ömeroğlu, the Sportswoman of the Year Shakika Ercümen, the Player of the Year Burzio Terçinğlu, the Woman of the Year in the Social Responsibility category were awarded.

Feeling worthless, the boy becomes obsessed with 'hate'
There are certain feelings that are innate in the world of human feeling.
Fear, sorrow, happiness, confusion, anger, worry... I know.
But feelings of hatred, resentment, revenge, they're just feelings that come with time and with some wrong attitude.
Every human being needs to be an individual, including childhood.
That means that the parent or social environment wants to respect the decisions, to be consulted on matters that concern him and to feel valued.
Providing these is the foundation of building a healthy personality.
For example, it is a lack of respect for the child's personality to decide for the child on matters that concern him (what to wear, what to eat), to ignore the child's wishes and to promote his own interests (to send a child who wants to go to a football school to an instrument course).
Since the child who is not respected for his identity and existence has lost the freedom to 'be his own', his defense mechanism will reveal feelings of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because it's the opposite of accepting anger and hatred", says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child does not accept what is done to him by hating, but tries to explain to himself and others that he is valuable.
"Hate is a 'me-too' that serves the purpose of maintaining the child's self-respect", says the psychologist, who notes that the child's rejection and reaction to the situation is a positive development in his personality.
"If the child is allowed to be an individual, hatred disappears".
The boy seeks to protect his self by taking refuge in anger and hatred.
Arslan said that when children are exposed to verbal and emotional violence by their parents and surroundings at an early age, when they are most vulnerable both physically and spiritually, it can cause negative emotions in the child, and neglect and neglect will make the child feel that his existence is not noticed, invisible.
"This can be in the form of not being able to meet their emotional needs (such as not caring for their hair, hugging, school, or other needs) or their physical needs (such as food, drink, housing, school needs, etc.)", says Arslan.
It is a parenting attitude that opens the door to anger and hatred.
Emotional and verbal violence, on the other hand, includes insults, insults, belittling, scolding, unnecessary and harsh punishments, making people feel worthless, yelling.
These are deeply touching because they are personality-specific.
"The child either loses self-esteem by accepting these things and spends his life struggling with feelings of worthlessness, unlovability and inadequacy, or he seeks to protect his own self by taking refuge in anger and hatred".
His teacher gave Boyko to Beşiktaş!
Dnipro, which Beşiktaş wants to buy two players, is preparing for the second half in Antalya Belek.
Technical Director Myron Markevych spoke to the broadcasting company about 27-year-old Denys Boyko, who was on the Black and White list.
Markevych praised the national goalkeeper, saying, "If two clubs agree, I would be happy if Boyko goes to Beşiktaş and makes him champion".
The 64-year-old coach also mentioned the case of the Brazilian stopper Douglas Silva Bacelar, born in 1990, who was transferred by the president Fikret Orman and his team.
Meanwhile, details of the official offer from River Plate to the Argentine player of the Black and Whites, Jose Sosa, have emerged.
Rodolfo D'Onofrio, the club president, has revealed that they are offering $2 million for the experienced midfielder, but Beşiktaş is asking for $9 million.
Kartal, who topped the Turkish Cup Group C, has turned his attention to the Super League.
In week 18, Mersin Idman Yurdu started preparations for the match that will be played at Başakşehir Stadium tomorrow.
The football club will go to the Constitutional Court for the points to be erased.
Denizlispor will seek its right to appeal to the Constitutional Court individually, on the grounds that the Arbitration Board of the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) has deleted 3 points on the grounds that it did not comply with the financial criteria.
Denizlispor President Mustafa Şavluk said that the Arbitration Board's decision is final and they will take it to the Constitutional Court.
The swallow, "The swallowing path is now exhausted".
And people can apply.
The arbitration board was supposed to rule in three months.
According to the Arbitration Committee Working Manual, the reasoned decision had to be announced within three months.
It's been four months since our application.
If the Constitutional Court says, 'There is a violation here', the situation could turn in our favor.
"We're not going to let you down", he said.
Şavluk added that their application could be a first in the sports world.
Not even the storm could stop the passengers of Hope.
118 Syrian and Pakistani fugitives, who had been on a journey of hope from Bodrum by boat and fishing boat, were rescued by Turkish and Greek Coast Guard teams.
105 Syrians, including women and children, who were trying to cross the Greek island of Kilimli (Kalimnos Island) in their 15-meter fishing boat from Yalıkavak Mahallesi Küdür Mevkii, experienced difficult moments when it hit the rocks of Kargı Island at 04.00 hours today.
The Syrians were rescued by Turkish Coast Guard teams with the help of fishermen who were stranded on boats sitting on rocks.
The 105th fugitive has been brought to the port of Yalıkavak.
The boat carrying 13 refugees from Pakistan and Syria, who were trying to cross the Greek island of Istanköy (Kos Island) on a 5 meter long rubber boat from Turgutreis, was swept off the coast of Psemiros Island due to the storm and the current.
The boat was spotted by Greek Coast Guard crews on patrol duty at 07:00 hours, when it was in danger of sinking.
Some of the refugees who fell into the sea were rescued and taken to the island of Kilimli.

Romania is moving towards transparency in election spending
A new bill is being drafted in Romania to fully determine the source of election money and to impose an upper limit on spending.
The government wants to make the donations made by individuals and companies that sponsor politicians in elections more transparent.

The bill requires that each party or individual spends money to be used in election propaganda through a bank account.
All the money spent in this way will be controlled more transparently and regularly by the Romanian Electoral College (AEP).
The bill also proposes an upper limit on spending.
Key words: Romania, election costs, transparency, Bucharest

Attacks on journalists in Turkey have become commonplace
25 famous writers sent a jointly signed letter from Turkey to British Prime Minister Cameron ahead of Prime Minister Davutoglu's visit to London next week.
PEN writers asked Cameron to bring up the decline in press and freedom of expression in Turkey in his meeting with Davutoğlu.
Leading writers in the UK have sent a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking him to raise the backlash in Turkey on freedom of the press and expression during his deputy Ahmet Davutoğlu's visit to London next week.
Twenty-five writers, including the presidents of the International Writers Union (PEN) in England, Wales and Scotland, expressed serious concern about "unprecedented pressures on freedom of expression in Turkey".
Threats and physical attacks on journalists, writers and publishers have become commonplace, the writers said, citing the attack on the offices of Hurriyet newspaper, the raids and seizures on Koza İpek Media Group as examples.
In a letter from PEN members including Tom Stoppard, Ali Smith, Ian Rankin, and Elif Shafak, three journalists working for Vice News were arrested, and other journalists were being sued and arrests were continuing.
The authors stated that the arrest of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül during the investigation phase in the case of MİT TIRs is also a cause for concern, saying that "it is vital that journalists in Turkey fulfill their essential duties in society, limit the public and allow them to inform without censorship".
He noted that the attacks on journalists, writers and publishers eroded the freedoms of the entire Turkish society.
He said that due to the widespread "culture of immunity", journalists and writers were subjected to harassment methods that went as far as physical attacks.
The authors pointed out that the number of Turkish citizens who are being sued for "insulting the president" has increased and that after Erdogan was elected in 2014, he has opened more libel cases than all of his predecessors combined.
Davutoğlu's words have been spoken
It was noted that Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who will visit London next week, is one of the few members of the government who expressed support for press freedom, but these words did not turn into action.
The letter stated, "Therefore Davutoglu's visit to London is an important opportunity to clearly commit to freedom of expression in Turkey".
The authors asked Cameron to call on Prime Minister Davutoğlu to ensure that his government respects Turkey's obligations regarding freedom of expression.
The letter was signed by 25 authors:
He was also the first person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in the field of international peace and security. He was the first person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, and the first person to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, for his work in the field of international peace and security.
