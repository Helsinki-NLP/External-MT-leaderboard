We Japanese grow up at 20.
We really appreciate your invention.
I am an agnostic.
I love this picture.
I shower every night.
I shower every night.
I'm a student.
Average, twice a month I go to see a movie.
Love is, by its nature, blind.
Are you for this policy, or are you against it?
He looked out the window.
He's the tallest of the three.
He stressed the convenience of city life.
He confessed to his guilt.
He came home late at night.
He teaches art at school.
The Japanese are brave.

The scientist focused on the experiment.
The game ends at 9:00.
The police dispersed the crowd.
This is the hottest day of the year.
Animals can't tell the difference between real and fictitious.

I don't have enough money to buy a dictionary.
"Where's your house?""He's there".
Don't be so hard on me, please.
Don't wait.
If time is not tangible, then the line that crosses this world and eternity, suffering for happiness, good for evil is also nothing but illusion.
We can't live there forever.
We have to deal with this problem.
We must learn to live in harmony with nature.
I love you, but I don't want to marry you.
I like jazz.
I never agree with him.
I live in the city.
I'm a cat.
I don't like coffee.
I don't like coffee.
I don't know if she'll come.
I can't forget the shock when I first heard the Beatles.
I'm not that brave.
I travel often.
I regret saying such a thing to my teacher.
I'm watching wild birds.
I'm tired now.
I'm tired.
I'm tired.
I need a favor.
I want to go abroad.
I want to buy a house.
I'm lying on the grass.
People like to talk and talk and talk...
Nobody came to my aid.
Never had more than $500.
Do you love me?
"You are Israel's teacher", Jesus said.
You think too much.
You have to file the report on Monday.
You must be careful about your room.
Can you identify the person in the photo?
You're just a social worm!
You have to do it, whether you like it or not.
We had no choice but to call the police.
Please think about it.
We were just talking about you when you called.
Just finished reading the book.
Good morning, Mike. I got it.

I arrived in 30 minutes.
The smartest thing you can do is avoid him.
He likes strange animals, like snakes, for example.
He likes to drink coffee without sugar.
He said he didn't go into the room, but it was a lie.
He made a quick decision.
He would walk to the office.
He kept writing about animals.
He smiled at me.
He's sitting on the bench.
He's not afraid of the poor.
He didn't say when he'd be back.
He boasts that he can speak six languages.
He went over to the other side.
He came close to her.
He refused my offer to drive him home.
He worked hard to provide for his family.
He's not used to the pace of the big city yet.
He's busy finding work.
He solved the problem easily.
He convinced me we weren't guilty.
He convinced me he was innocent.
He took off from a recorder.
I decided to be happy, because it's good for my health.
I decided to be happy, because it's good for my health.
Typhoon hit the city and caused enormous damage.
The ceremony will be tomorrow.
She made me a fish.
She's gotten in more than she can swallow and become a mockery.
She looked at her mother.
She wears a hat.
She's late to pay her rent.
She tore the letter apart.
I used to eat pizza, but now I don't.
I was willing to help you with the test, but you refused.
The boy got a cold.
This hat is too small for me.
Everything was delicious!
Everything was delicious!
They were looking for shelter from the rain.

Everyone wants to be happy.
Everyone shut up!
Because he worked in self-sacrifice, he succeeded.
It's so hot today!
