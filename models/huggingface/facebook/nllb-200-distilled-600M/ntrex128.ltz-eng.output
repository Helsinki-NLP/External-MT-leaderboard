Welsh MPs are worried about looking like idiots.
There is a debate among some MPs over a proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
MEPs across the political spectrum are concerned about being ridiculed.
A Labour MP was worried it would be a rallying cry on Twp and PwP.
For readers outside Wales: Twp means dum and pwp cake in Welsh.
A Plaid party deputy said the group as a whole would be "not happy" and suggested an alternative.
A Welsh Conservative said his group had opted to change the name, but said MWP and Muppet would not be far apart.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English letter "u".
The Assembly's committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on the appointment of deputies is, of course, up to the deputies themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received a lot of support.
The Commission favoured "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs", but the MWP option received more support at a public meeting over the question of the title of MPs.
The deputies seem to have suggested other options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could cause headaches for the chief executive, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the bill within two weeks.
The reform legislation includes other amendments, such as the way the Assembly functions, including rules on disqualification of deputies and the draft committee system.
The deputies are given the final say on the question of what to call them when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians are voting in a referendum on changing the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was cast in a proposal to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly voted against its commitment to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change vote, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that changing the name is the price to pay for the EU to join NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are as quiet as the church during the Battle of Harlem
"Once upon a time, the old people said, there was a cafe and a church around every corner", Mr. Adams said.
Now there is nothing left.
He said the coffee rush was understandable.
"People are socializing differently today", he said.
Coffee is no longer a popular place for people to go to.
As for the church, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of his property may not last as long as the owners of the land hope, and sooner or later they may return to their original position.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with private housing and filled with people who would not help the remaining patrons in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy properties in these buildings are white", he said, "and they want to close these churches quickly because it's unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white communities, before Harlem became a black capital by the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved in the 1930s.
A black community nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major thoroughfare for Harlem's trade that did not want to hire blacks.
The building was badly damaged by a fire in 1939, but when members of Father Johnson's community made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the bell tower.
The Rev. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's, called the clock a glorious "Clock of the Poor".
The expert who played the clock in July called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first clown performed by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who turned to the biggest clown at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months has been a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, some introduced by lay leaders, others by the bishops.
The "sacrifice" of the Ports Authority, with lay responsibility, wrote to the diocese in July, fearing that the diocese would "reverse the costs to the sacrifice", although the sacrifice was not involved in the hiring of the architects and entrepreneurs who sent the diocese.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark wounded 13-year-old in lobster diving in California.
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he was diving for lobster in California, officials said on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack happened shortly before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was on a Saturday morning after a half hour with friends when he heard the boy crying for help and was overwhelmed with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
The hammer said that at first he thought it would be easy to catch a hammer, but then realized that he was "happened".
I'm going to be drunk!
His whole key was unlocked, and the dog noticed that he had come to the boy.
And I said to them, Let them come out of the water; and behold, a shark is in the water. And the ram said, Let it come out.
The boy was rushed to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The type of shark that attacked is unknown.
SpongeBob Capt. Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-hazardous species.
Giles also said the victims suffered traumatic injuries to their upper body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are considered non-threatening.
Sainsbury's is entering the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's hosts boats, super drugs and Debenhams, with a grocery-style beauty department with specialized assistants.
As part of a major climb in the UK beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow steadily, while fashion and home goods are returning, these larger beauty departments will be expanding to 11 stores across the country, and to more stores next year if successful.
Supermarkets invest in beauty because they want to fill the shelves that were previously reserved for teas, microwaves and other household goods.
Sainsbury's said it would scale its beauty offering to 3,000 products for the first time with brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees assortments will also gain more space with exclusive brands, similar to those in the boat shops.
The supermarket is also launching its boutique make-up range, so the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by young consumers.
The fragrance shop will test concession bids at two Sainsbury's stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year
Online shopping and small quantities of everyday food and small shops means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to get people to shop.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said that outlets would increasingly look more like department stores as supermarket chains tried to fight more services and non-food products against discounter Aldi and Lidl.
In addition, the company has opened hundreds of shops and establishments in Argos and several other habitat shops since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago, which has increased sales of food and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to overhaul the cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots, but the partnership was quickly dissolved after a dispute over the share of revenue from the drugstores and supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281Drug stores to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for £125 million three years ago.
Llodys is expected to play a role in the plan, opening an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, and four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsburys, said: "We've changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit all needs. Thanks to a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that represents the old fashioned way of shopping and shopping.
Peter Jones is swindling about an £11 million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has been cast after television presenter Holly Willoughby signed a £11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced on her Instagram account that she is leaving.
Holly Willoughby has pulled Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "swaying" as the TV star during a tense meeting on Thursday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts worth up to £1.5 million meant she no longer had time for her brand of homewear and accessories Truly.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his vacation homes.
A source said, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It would have been their long-term future, which would have accompanied them through the next century.
Their decision surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on the Sabbath, for it was as it was from the beginning.
In the headquarters in Marlow there is a warehouse of goods ready for sale.
Experts say the departure of This-Morining, one of Britain's most bankable stars, could cost the company millions as it invests heavily in products ranging from boxes and candles to clothing and homewear, and there are now potentially further delays to launch.
It could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the table with the Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took office as president in March.
The couples are going on vacation together and Jones is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night, "We will not comment on his business dealings".
We talked hard and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would get from the media for a comment that some people would consider to be "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean president.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in his "television moderator's voice".
I have not given up anything.
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump's first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea.
The negotiations on denuclearization are not yet complete.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told top politicians during the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a "corresponding response" from the US to North Korea's previous disarmament efforts.
Instead, the US would continue to impose sanctions to further pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"We're doing well with North Korea", he said.
We'd go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had led to positive results: no more missile tests, aid to release hostages, and the rescue of American soldiers who had fallen in battle from deadly survivors, stopped missile tests, rescued lives and rescued American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to run in this crowded arena, we would only have 200 people here, Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been relocated, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalysis of international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so this is a challenge", Ms Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to work with foreign personnel on site.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Management Administration, said Indonesian officials would assess the situation in palu to see if international agencies could participate in the relief effort.
Regarding the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country unfortunately remains unprepared for the will of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not found anywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, despite a warning, likely cost many lives.
Travel between the various Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquakes is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the scene of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo made improving Indonesia's infrastructure as a key issue of his election campaign and donated money for roads and railways.
But Mr Joko's government was also plagued by a lack of funding, and he will re-elect next year.
Mr Joko is also under pressure from party tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority represent a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought with knives, spears, razors and other brutal weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge compares the match to a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool by a goal in the 89th minute, a Samsen at Stamford Bridge in London against a Premier League defeat to Chelsea.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal and led his team 1-0 on aggregate.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot towards the goal.
The attempt has flown high above the box, towards the left corner of the net.
The ball flew over a jumping Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"It was just about getting into this position, getting the ball and players like Shaq always playing as much as possible, so I tried to save myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw the edge and I touched it once, and I didn't think about it and just shot.
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead after the break by a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues star made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before being sent down to Liverpool halfway.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the middle.
He then threw a beautiful ball that sent the Hazard into the box.
Hazard runs along the defense and ends on the long shot with a left-footed shot around Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
According to the agency's spokesman, Mr Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, many people were locked in the rubble of buildings that were destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered the wave up to 20 feet high.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was covered with dust from the collapsed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Mews on John Street.
People in the area who see or hear something should report to the police.
Police inspector Brian O'Hagen said: "The investigation is still in its early stages, but anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious in the John Street area of Birkenhead should contact us.
I would also urge anyone else, especially taxi drivers who have recorded something on dashcam footage, to contact us, as they may have information that may be important to our investigations.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Birkenhead and was found in a house.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman come to the scene to ask where the body was found.
Police are continuing their investigation and are informing other family members of the victim.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews was just returning to his apartment, but police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building at the moment.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Now residents are told that it may take hours for them to return home.
One police officer was reported to have told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She's repeating it over and over again and it's so terrible.
At 14:00, two police trucks were inside the blockade and another outside the blockade.
Some police officers stopped inside the blockade and patrolled the residential areas.
Anyone with information should contact @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 Protocol 247 of 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the new memorial to the author of the series History Rewrite.
His banishment would be a poetic justification for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts in England by the Taliban's fanatical and puritanical supporters.
But the Cromwell Society describes Mr. Crick's suggestion as "a foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the debate over the replacement of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The symbolism of the English Civil War was not carried out nor ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorney's large-scale representation of Cromwell is evidence of 19th-century opinion and is part of the historical record of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, many first in the late 19th century as a defender of parliament against foreign pressure, in his case of course the monarchy.
Whether this is a very accurate representation is still a matter of debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure who represents a side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and memory.
Pig Meat Farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a ruptured artery near a stable in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig inspector prepares to inject pigs with vaccines at a hoffery in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
According to reports, he was arrested on Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and an open door to a nearby swindle was discovered.
He said that in the barn was a large male pig with blood on the snout.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to the report.
My cousin's legs were bloody and forbidden, according to the Guyang Evening News.
CCTV footage shows Yuan going to market at 4:40 a.m. on a Thursday morning to feed the pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man is not a pig of Yuan or his cousin.
A market operator told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police gathered evidence at the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family is likely to be negotiating compensation for his death with market authorities.
If so, there were cases where the pigs attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts wharf.
In 2006, a 650-pound heavy pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his truck until his wife was able to leave the animal.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pig in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger".
They're just playing games.
They're just pushing, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show enough respect, he said.
Rainfall in the southwest of the United States due to the Rose Hurricane
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it moves over the cool waters of Mexico's northern coast.
However, the Rose will bring flooding to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
DRosa had winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane since 5:00 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, Mexico.
The sun is expected to rise in the north.
Meanwhile, a channel is being formed across the Pacific Ocean, stretching toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa gets closer to the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep tropical moisture from the north and southwest U.S.
DRosa will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture that interacts with the nearest channel will form a wide-spread heavy lock in the southwest over the next few days.
Local 1 to 4 inches of reefs cause dangerous flooding, mudslides and possible desertification.
Heavy tropical humidity causes locks of 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially much of Arizona.
Floods are possible, with weather conditions getting worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be extremely easy to walk in the desert at the risk of tropical storms.
Deck reefs can cause canyons that quickly become rivers and thunderstorms will bring local rough air and dust.
The nearest canal will bring thick local reefs to parts of the southern California coast.
Locks of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mud flats and smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region during the travel season.
Some distributed tropical storms begin to move closer to Arizona, in late Sundays and early months, before the storm continues to spread, in late months and on Thursdays.
The heavy rain will be distributed in the Four Corners on Thursday and Wednesday.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations across the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a sunset in the center of the United States.
There is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, the summer heat will try to build and expand.
In many central and eastern U.S. states, a warm start is expected in October with a wide 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach 80 degrees on Thursday, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast will give high chances of extreme temperatures for the eastern United States through the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
Over 20 million people watched a Thursday's heartbreaking Supreme Court statement by Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, accused of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s on six television stations.
Meanwhile, political fallout continued, and the broadcasters interrupted regular broadcasts for a Friday's last-minute tweet: an agreement that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake signed with the FBI to conduct investigations during a week of the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was fully involved and tried to dress her up at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people reportedly watched the trial on Friday.
The company has averaged viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
A number of other networks that carried the process, including PBS, C-Span and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen often has some difficulties in counting the people who look in offices.
To illustrate: the audience count is equal to that of a playoff football game or the Oscar nomination.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators supported Kavanaugh's term, guided all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remains high after the trial.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was greeted by the courage of protesters in trying to lift a lawsuit in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes down while he was being yelled at and was live on CNN.
"I'm right here in front of you", said a woman.
Do you think he will judge the land?
"You have power, " he replied, "but so many women do not have power".
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before entering the elevator, that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks later broadcast live hours of how the Judiciary Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI is investigating the allegations against the nominee for next week, which is what the Democratic minority wants.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and some senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the vote to vote for Kavanaugh without an inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of her plans to leave the European Union  to play politics with the UK's future and national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will be attending the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, in addition to her front page, her former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson underscored her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that a proposal that the UK and the EU raise their taxes on each other would be "absolutely ridiculous".
Wayde-Sims shooting: Police arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and taken to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpson and police said the Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on it, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he admitted to shooting the Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a provisional report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department honors the refugee officers of the Louisiana State Police, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their efforts and their quest for justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound native grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, the LSU basketball coach said his team was devastated and shocked by Wayde's death.
"That's what you always worry about", Wade said.
Volcano releases ash on Mexico City
Spent ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater on Saturday, and has recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in the last 24 hours.
The center recorded some thunder and lightning.
Images on social media show thin layers of car shelves in neighborhoods like Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geophysicists have noted a zoom of volcanic activity that has been moving 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters were dispatched to the police, and thousands joined rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of the Catalan polarising vote for secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists were held back in a riot against police with eggs and powdered leaves, which formed dark clouds in the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
Clashes broke out later that day and police removed their bullets to control the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups have called for "forget about it, no apology" against unionists who have called for "long-lived Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized after injuries during the protests, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the region one year after the referendum on October 1 was declared illegal by Madrid, but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly voted to become independent, but the result was low against the vote to boycott the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the elections and the polling stations through violent conflicts in the region.
Pro-independence groups camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration over support for the national police.
The demonstration continued, but had to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who joined his wife in the separatist protest, says he has no hope for the prospects of an independent Catalonia.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could walk, but now I'm stuck", he said.
Despite a decisive, if narrow, victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties had a hard time staying in this year's struggle. Most of the most prominent leaders were in exile or imprisonment and awaited their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests by phone in support of the police, said the conflict was heated by politicians from both sides.
"It is becoming more and more tense", he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would be taking part in next year's European elections.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression and democratic values and repression we have seen from the Spanish government", he said.
London: Arrested after car crash
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a broken arm at some point.
Livingston won 1-0 against Rangers by Menga's goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Promoted Livingston scored the Rangers' only second win in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's storm proved the difference in how Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remained unbeaten in the Premier League this season and play against Leaders Hearts on Sunday, eight points ahead of them.
Earlier, Rangers Rapid Vienna hosted the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still enjoying the win since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is losing the odds against open visitors.
Holt's team should have had the news long before the match, as their directness caused the Ranger problems.
Scott Robinson was knocked out but carried his efforts to the goal, then Alan Lithgow could only aim his efforts before he hit Craig Halkett for the goal.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery among the visitors.
And so the gold went down.
The Rangers received a free kick and Livingston stood up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play the Menga, which once touches and hits the center of the box.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the property but found the home defense impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly quiet.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade of Kelly.
Scott Pittman was dismissed by Rangers goalkeeper Allen McGregor at Lithgow by a further draw from Livingston.
Crosses always came to the box and were always thrown around, while two eleven-foot was required - after the hook challenged replacement Glenn Middleton, and one for handball was dropped.
Wonderful by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, to continue to exceed expectations in this high way.
Their style of play and staff has barely changed since his return to the top flight, but great credit has to go to the hole for the way he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was immensely organized, leading a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
Rangers were very inspired.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they were short as the standards fell.
The last pass was only passed when they were measuring the side of the house and it was like waking up for the rangers who were in the middle of the field.
Erdogan is receiving a different reception in Cologne.
There was laughter and blue skies on Saturday (September 29) as the chefs of Turkey and Germany watched them drink coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany  which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan is on his way to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have taken security measures to block a massive crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan opponents, many of them Kurdish, have also made their voices heard, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both protests reflect the divisions of a visitor who is welcomed as a hero by some German Turks and as a monarch by others.
Deptford road accident: Cyclist dies in collision with a car.
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southwest of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescue workers came to the rescue, but the man died on the spot.
The crash happened months after a cyclist died in a driver's escape on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
The city police said the officers were identifying the man and informing the family.
Roadblocks and bus stops are in place and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in disorder
Six prisoners were injured in a disorderly manner in a high-security prison for men, the prison officer said.
Disorder broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and it continues.
Specialist Tornado officers were abused to attend the order, which involved eight prisoners and one prisoner.
Officers were treated in the square for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said specially trained prison staff were deployed to handle the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible could be turned over to the police and spend more time behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was being treated at the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, offensive officers were called to the prison to deal with a severe disorder in which the staff were attacked with billiards balls.
Hurricane Rosa floods Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
It's rare to see a tropical depression hit Arizona, but that's what's likely to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa's latest energy pulls down through the southwestern desert and brings with it flood risks.
The National Weather Service has already forecast flooding for months and months for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct route across Phoenix to the Danes and come closer months later with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only ten tropical cyclones have been able to maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 inches of rainfall, with isolated amounts up to 6 inches in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, may receive 1 to 2 centimetres, with isolated sums up to 4 centimetres.
For those without flood risks, the rainfall of the rose is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, some of the rainfall is likely to be good because the southwest is currently in dry conditions.
The United States, after just over 40 percent of Arizona, is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second-highest category", weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa makes its way to land on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on a Sunday morning with maximum wind speeds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm moved to more tidal waters in the Pacific and lost strength.
So, it is expected to hit land in Mexico with tropical storm strength on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rains could affect parts of Mexico, posing a significant flood risk.
Weather from 3 to 6 centimetres are expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 centimetres possible, weather.com reports.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, then rising through Arizona and southern Utah late on Thursday.
The main threat to the Rose or its remnants is severe downpours in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern United States Desert, according to the National Hurricane Center.
This rainfall is expected to produce life-threatening floods and mudslides in the desert, in the earth and in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton robbery four alleged murders arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found with stake in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured near the Excelsior terraces in Midsomer Norton, around 4am a Saturday.
If he was taken to the hospital, his health would be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a man under 20 were arrested in the vicinity of Radstock, police said.
Police have called for witnesses who may have recorded something on their cell phones to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh suffers from the public and the anger of the Democratic Party.
The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party, Trump said at a ballot in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from the very recklessness and wrath of the Democratic Party throughout the entire election process.
Kavanaugh vehemently and emotionally denounced Christine Blasey Ford's allegation that he sexually abused her when she was a teenager before Congress on Thursday.
Ford also swore that there was a statement here.
The President told a gathering that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh.
A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a vote for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed death toll for the public.
The president highlighted Kavanaugh's nomination during his speech on the importance of Republican electoral participation in half of the election period.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lifetime.
'I don't run, but I run really,' he said.
So I went everywhere to fight for big candidates.
Trump has argued that he is on a mission to slow down and stop.
The first Senate-level election for Kavanaugh's nomination should be held on Friday, a senior Matta employee told CNN.
Hundreds of deaths from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many flooded as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities in Samsun said.
Hundreds of people attended a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as 6 meter high waves hit the coast in the semi-dark, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was reportedly caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
As the tsunami threat grew yesterday, people were still on the beach to continue their activities and did not immediately leave, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian disaster protection, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, huts, cottages, everything was swept ashore", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had been hitting the sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Several people climbed to the mountains to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated in 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs made public by the Disaster Protection Agency show many buildings and warehouses destroyed, bridges that have collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The Samsodians were still in the coastal city.
Earthquakes have affected a region of 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Assessment and Use of Technology said in a statement that the energy of the free zone was 200 times stronger than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city at the end of a long-cut bay may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extraem" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Bodies were found under the shots of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the damage and injuries could be large on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in an area called Doggola and near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication is completely broken down and we are without information from Donggola, said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, with staff and volunteers in the affected areas.
"This is a tragedy, but it can be worse", he said.
The agency was criticized for only saying that Palu had been hit by Tsunami, officials said the waves came at the same time as the warning was issued.
Amateur images on social media show a man on a higher stack warning you of a tsunami by calling you down the street.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, and buildings and cars are crumbling.
Reuters was only able to confirm the bills directly.
The earthquake and tsunami caused massive power outages and communication around Palu was hampered by difficulties for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has sent first transport flights with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuees still urgently need food and supplies for their most urgent needs.
The local airport was opened only for rescue teams and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 800.
It's very bad.
While Donggola's World Vision staff arrived safely in Palu City, where employees were being held in tents on the premises of this office, they had to face scenes of destruction, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me that many houses were destroyed", he says.
It's very bad.
As aid teams began to realize the extent of the destruction, some complained that foreign aid teams with extensive experience were only allowed to enter Palu.
According to Indonesian laws, equipment and personnel are only allowed in the country if the affected area is declared a national disaster area.
But that's not happening yet.
"There is still a regional disaster", said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
As the government says, OK, it's a national disaster, we can open up to international aid but it's not happening yet.
As the second night in Palu comes after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, friends and families hope that the missing are among the miracles that will always appear after such disasters.
To be rescued from a canal like a little boy on Samsen.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman buried under a pile of shots, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two of the most missed paragliders shot for Asian athletes,
Others from the Roa Roa Hotel were young students, Mr. Mandagi said.
"As an old hound in a parlour, I carried my own emotional burden", he says.
Mr Gendon said that in the hours after the dawn when rumors of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel and the paragliding group were going around, he sent WhatsApp messages to the team that was attending the Beach Festival.
Unfortunately, seven of the stories were drawn with only one hook, and only two with blue hooks.
"I think the news is just a lie", he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport/Levee.
The robbers on Friday beat a Brink's security guard who had gone under a banknote and stole $26,750 from Newport/Levee, according to a statement from Newport Police.
The driver was about to empty the ATM in a detention complex and was about to pay the money, police officer Dennis McCarthy wrote.
While he was busy, another man came up behind the brink's employees and stole the money from the bank.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, but police said they had only seen how many.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In a Twitter announcement, he wrote: "The official name is Kanye West.
West, 41, has been known as Ye since and has used the title as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes alongside a singing performance on Saturday Night Live, where the start of singer's new album is expected.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande, who can only appear on the show for emotional reasons, according to the show's founder.
Although it is a shortened form of the name "Sung" in professional usage, the West has already noted that the word also has a religious meaning for it.
"I believe ye is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means du", West said earlier this year, during a presentation of his new album on Big Boy Radio.
I am the sea, I am the sea.
It's from Kanye, that's the only one, to just you -- in the mirror of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers to change their name.
Sean Combs was once called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he decided to go for Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-singer, Jay-Z, also played with small and large scripts.
DAMLO and Mexico have vowed to use military force against civilians
In the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians.
Lopez Obrador has promised under the terms of the agreement that he will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.
During a peaceful demonstration on the Plaza on October 2, 1968, troops shot and killed 300 people at a time when the left-wing rally was marching through Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has announced that he will support young Mexicans by providing monthly student grants and opening more free universities.
He has noted that unemployment and the lack of schooling promotes criminal gangs.
The US would double the funding of K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double its share of AI research, says AI investor and friend Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after increasing reports from the US government that the US does not have a proper strategy in researching the KIC.
In exchange, China announced its plan last year: the first in AI research is to be completed by 2030.
Duplication of the research budget for artificial intelligence is a good start, considering that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence, Lee says.
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next leap being made in the US, Lee told CNN in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order came out this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most well-known AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, later serving as Director General of Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee was aware of previous technology competitions in the US such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when they would be next to help you find your next visionary.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to get government aid, Lee says.
"It's not just China that has the academic top-notch; it's the societies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring luminaries in recent years to work on AI in universities.
Lee said that under the Improvement of Immigration Law, he could also launch research in the US.
I think the green card should be automatically offered to AI professors, he says.
The Chinese State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people to academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to do research in the US, but the quality of academic work is not as good as in China, the LEE says.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established joint AI centers to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the establishment of a committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA has invested $2 trillion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, which is currently investing over $100 million in AI.
The US government has been acting for months to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia decides to change the name of the country by referendum
The people of Macedonia have in a referendum held on whether to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia, which has been a step forward in the ongoing dispute with Greece that prevents its membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its neighbour is being used to claim the province and has vetoed NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal for the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has shown that it is difficult for the president to achieve 50% of the vote.
The referendum's opening words are: "Do you support NATO and EU membership with the agreement with Greece?
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price would be paid for a membership in organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of the former Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because more and more life is safe for all of us", says Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although only legally, enough MPs said they would be interested in the outcome of the vote.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities would be reported until 1 p.m.
Nevertheless, the electoral participation remained at only 16%, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66% of eligible voters were elected.
I chose to move to Europe to raise my children, and our place is in Europe, says 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski of Wiehler, in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko announced in a referendum in Macedonia that the name of the country would be changed for the path to NATO and the European Union on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, has set up a small stage in silence outside the tents of those who boycott the referendum.
We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to get our heads high, only through their hands, says Kavadarkov.
"We are in a poor country, but we are proud.
If they want us to be just Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and be part of Euro-Asia integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring us significant investments in Macedonia, which is over 20 percent under the Chomagetaux.
I believe that the majority of people, because more than 80 percent of the population is for NATO and the EU, say the Zaev after leaving the polling booth.
He said that the result would be a confirmation of our future.
A poll last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would vote in the referendum - less than expected.
Another poll by the Macedonian television channel Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent voted yes.
For the referendum to be valid, 50% plus one must vote.
A defeat in the election would be the first major setback in the pro-Western government's campaign since May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City breaks through the whole defence of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's Defence at Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero narrowly missed the ball in the 65th minute.
The Argentine bullfighter was given a pass in the middle of the field at the start of the race.
He ran three defence for Brighton and then had an open field.
Aguero then struck out four opponents.
He had pushed one defender away and had played against the other in the Viennese half.
He then went to the left where the pound was taken.
The Englishman came close to the first goal and had to turn to Aguero, who had turned his foot to the goalkeeper of Brighton and the ball in the left corner.
Aquero is currently having minor foot problems, City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
I've been waiting for him to play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are happy that he had scored a goal at that moment.
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aquero scored the ball halfway through Brighton.
He had a wonderful pass over the left flank at the Leroy Sane.
Sane had been a little dribbling before he passed a long pass to the pound.
The Sky Blues had just thrown the ball into the net before it went out.
City will play Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12:55 pm on Monday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
The joke about the game against the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there's a reason to force a fresh start.
But the always-only Scherzer hopes to win the game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs, which is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies climbed to a wild-card 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday evening, but still struggled to cement their first division title.
Even if we're playing for nothing, at least we can make a big game knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver is with the audience and the other team that will probably play at the highest level I'll experience this year.
Why should I not be concerned?
The Nationals have yet to announce how they will start a Sunday, but it is certainly advisable to let the sherzer pitch in that situation.
The shooter, who will be playing his 34th start, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will play a Sunday on his break.
The Wests of Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump on election day in West Virginia
The president has highlighted the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the House of Representatives while stressing the importance of a Republican victory in this midterm election.
All we planned for November is on the line.
Five weeks before the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big  I'm not only running but I'm running really, so I'm fighting for good candidates, he says.
Trump goes on, you see these strong, strong radical groups of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
They are determined to rule over you in every way. You see, there is no sin in your conduct, no disrespect.
Those who don't care who they hurt, who they have to pass on to get their power and control, if they want it, we don't give them power and control.
Democrats, he says, are on a mission of resisting and blocking.
"For four days", he said, "you have been accused of being arrogant, sinless, disorderly and deceitful".
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein as the most heavily exploited.
Do you remember the answer here?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, wait.
No, uh, no, I thought -- that was a really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Work is no longer given by God.
It's intolerant of those who think that they are.
When momentum activists in my constituency voted against me, I was a little surprised.
Finally, if I were the last member of a labor party to be seeded, we would be welcome - only because we think we are.
My party colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was determined against anti-Semitism.
In my case, as the censor, I was criticized for not being right with Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt points to the importance of responsible economic, national security and security policies in Europe, ironically in situations similar to those Jeremy has criticized in previous leadership.
The note for Nottingham East Workers' Meeting on Friday says that we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive.
In most of my eight years as a local worker representative, Friday evening meetings were just as relevant.
Unfortunately, today, as the sound of many meetings and the promises of friendship and good politics are more pronounced than ever before, I have forgotten politics for a long time.
It is increasingly striking that other views are only tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is considered acceptable to the party leadership.
This was shortly after Jeremy took over the leadership, and colleagues I had worked with before had expected me to take a similar political view and take a position I would never have taken - in national security as well as in the EU's internal affairs.
Every time I publicly tweeted - and it doesn't really matter what I said - I got a ton of comments on social media against the politics of the middle, and they told me I only had my place in the Labour Party.
And then it was just my experience.
However, I know that I do better than some of my colleagues because the comments I receive are political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and who never look away.
One of the most sad aspects of these political times is that the level of abuse is becoming increasingly normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour Party to adopt a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer of God, and with every movement of unbelief and change of choices the voice of the church is heard more and more.
I have been given many counsels over the last two years to stay calm, not to be too hard, and then I was in the line.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, prompted by a neglect by the Thatcher government during which my classroom was almost collapsing, I have tried to improve public services for those who need it most, whether as a local politician or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could question my political position and the points on which I disagree with the current leadership.
For those who support the freedom movement, all I want to say is that if the country opposes Brexit, which is harmful to households, trade and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy and my time with the Labour Party.
But the only message I have is for Nottingham momentum, it's for my constituents, whether Labour or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that no pressure or political statement will stop me from doing what I believe is best for you all.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38  17 Melrose Ayr unhurt to the top
Two attempts in the last few days have boosted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular Tennent's premiership match of the day.
They are now on the top, the only undefeated team out of 10.
In the end, it was a better defense, as well as better seizures of opportunities, which the home team and coach Peter Murchie were happy about.
"We've been challenged in our games so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Good for Ayr, they took the opportunity better than we did".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, backed by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr closer, but a yellow card for Scottish forward Rory Hughes, which he received in a Warriors game, weakened Melrose and allowed Jason Baggot to start an unconverted attempt.
Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr just before halftime, he then converted a single attempt to score 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose got off to a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson's run, carried by Baggot, could reduce the gap to five points.
After a break due to a broken Ruaridh knot, which was broken, in a new prison, Ayr was able to restart through a run by Stafford McDowall, carried by the Climo.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then awarded a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to use the advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, under heavy pressure.
The home team came back, as always, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for throwing the Climo without a ball on the line, Macpherson was able to score a touchdown in the back of attacking Ayr.
The Climo was able to turn around as he had done from the start after Kyle Rowe managed to kick David Armstrong's kick and beat the flanker Gregor Henry in the seventh inning.
After star players looking for a new career in the hotel industry
Still a star player, Ford Kieran is looking to switch to hotel after finding out he has been nominated as a restaurant chain director.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis stars in the popular BBC show he writes and co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the next nine episodes will be the last of the show, and Kiernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is a director at Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor borrows any commentary on the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun has revealed that Kiernan has entered the dflourishing restaurant industry of Glasgow.
The sea is ours: Bolivia hopes that the justice system will reopen the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol under cover at La Paz's headquarters.
Public buildings hoisted an ocean blue flag.
The naval bases run from the Titicaca Sea to the Amazon under the motto: "The sea is ours rightfully".
It is our duty to recover it.
The memory of a 19th-century conflict on the Chilean coast that has been lost to Bolivia, surrounded by land, is still alive.
Right now, hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the spirit of solidarity and unity and, of course, hopes for a positive decision", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians follow the International Court of Justice's decision on the big screen in the hope that The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia and that after decades of sporadic talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia who is leading a controversial election campaign next year, relies heavily on the talks of Monday.
"We are going back to the Pacific just before", he said in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will probably not decide in favor of Bolivia and that it would not change much if it did.
The Netherlands-based DUN agency has no influence over Chile and said it would not interfere in any possible talks.
The fact that the court's decision was delivered six months after the final hearing shows that the case was not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of bringing the Bolivian oil forward, the last four years have been a decline.
The question of access to the sea has been torpedoed by the current Bolivian administration, the Zarate said.
Morales's militant rhetoric has weakened, clarified, all Chilean will.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue to talk, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not sent ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, as Bolivian representative in The Hague, stressed that the court's decision was delivered particularly quickly.
He said that Monday offers Bolivia an extraordinary opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to resolve a 139-year-old dispute with mutual benefits.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales  remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents  uses the maritime exit as a political springboard.
Bolivia has never stopped claiming its right to access the Pacific, he said.
"The judgment is a time to try and put our past behind us.
North Korea says no nuclear weapon can be used until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the United States to keep its promises made to the presidents of rivals at the Singapore summit.
His comments came as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tried to revive the disrupted nuclear negotiations of diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a dream that further sanctions and the US's opposition to a declaration of war against Korea would force Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about approving the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first steps towards a massive disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is a general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about disarming an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show a massive rise in headgear on the streets.
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of oversized head covers for their SS19 collection at the Catwalk, which showcased the style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Absolutely impractical finds have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something that resembled a feather floating over the model's head.
Others oversize accessories with ornamental watermelons, a mixture of hat and pineapple but they're not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also released some strange masks just right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have been used to lighten lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter more than Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a diving costume complete with snorkels and glasses, while another looks like a melted ice cornet.
And if you want to see more, don't be fooled.
Style observers predict that the huge cape could find its way to you on the street.
The oversized figure is strongly similar to the feast of La Bomba, the 60-cm-wide boarheaded hood that has been seen in Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly impractical finds that have flooded social media is sending another big creation to the catwalk, a street basket as big as the model it presents.
The deep orange basket, with a white leather hood, was the main focus of Jacquemus' La-Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hits and beach crawls on our streets next summer because designers have made such an impact, it's going to be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
The independent schools of Scotland hold the record for academic achievement and this 2018 continued with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective achievements in sport, art, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30 000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to achieve the best level of service for their pupils and parents.
Independent schools are working to prepare their students for further and higher education, for their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As a teaching institution with a well-rounded and discussed curriculum, modern languages are seen as a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in your own tongue, he will hear you.
This is a strong reminder that we must not rely solely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From these examinations, we can see that languages are at the top of the list, with the best results among independent schools.
68 percent of students who studied foreign languages finished with an A+.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72 percent of students have an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent have also achieved an A in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as electives are now considered the same as the main subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also to be considered differently.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Vocational Skills found that employers say it is difficult to fill vacancies, with 17 percent saying it is due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming important to prepare young people for their future tasks.
With more jobs coming up that require languages, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a global world.
Regardless of the career you choose, when you learn a second language, you have a real future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the top of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England in 2013, 75 percent are unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French still ranking as the second most spoken language, with 15 percent still in the second-tier.
That is why it is so important to invest in learning languages in today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in the growing economies, gives children better opportunities to find meaningful work.
In Scotland, every school offers different languages.
A host of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while learning other languages that could be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child's interests, there is always a wealth of languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers specialising in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children for and gives them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future may look like.
In a global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages are vital for the future of the country and that this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools provide this choice, diversity and outstanding performance for young people in Scotland.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for the fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play a preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is only necessary to determine how many minutes he will play.
They're more like a couple and less than 48, Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As usual, James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-player preseason schedule.
"I don't need a forward at this point in my career to be ready", he said.
Trump's election tour of West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a wildfire of ballroom campaigns this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the next week, with stations on him in sunny places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in the lead up to his election as chief justice, Trump is aiming to run for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia election tonight, and how do you watch it online?
Trump's election for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19 pm ET.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia election online via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump would mention this week's announcement for the late incarceration nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose election for the charge of sexual assault of a former senator was suspended for a week while the FBI is investigating the case.
But the first goal is to help the Republicans to re-elect in November and gain momentum.
President Trump's campaign said the five events in the coming week aim to give new energy to the "volunteers and supporters", while Republicans seek to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House, according to Reuters.
Congress's control is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the height of the campaign, a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the election event will bring fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania to the evening and be covered by the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is relying on the polls.
"There is no good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to come to help him get up and running", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 Team USA demonstrates courage in the fight for the hopes of keeping the single match alive on Sunday
After three side-sessions, the four-way battle can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging pendulum is a very inventive sporting concept, but one that players believe in, and never again in competitions like this.
Where would they say the swing is right?
"They had a six-point lead and now they're four points ahead, so we see that now as a small swing", Jordan Spieth said as he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead of the rest of the world.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel a little wind in their sails and they have a lot to get up to, not to mention the Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and they both score three out of four points.
Spieth was dead from tea to green and is an example.
The cheerful Kiel geese became harder as his round progressed, a crucial pitcher to kick the game off and where Thomas is two by two behind him.
His pitcher, who won the game at 15, was left with a similar circle, the kind that would suggest that he believes the American team is not out.
"You just have to dig deep enough and take care of your own game", Spieth said.
That's all that's left of all these games now.
18 laughs to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old but popular couples are four times ahead and can do nothing wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who did not shoot a bogey on Saturday, but they did use the Saturday, Friday and the nine back to Friday.
At this run, and as their energy seems to flow to and from the spectators, they cement that they are the players who are going to hit it off on a Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to watch for a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National, like Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different laughs.
The European Parliament has already been informed of the results of the negotiations.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson had a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning in Fourball, as a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the top nine buried the Spaniards and Swedes in a laugh they couldn't get out of so quickly.
A Sunday is not there to help you out of laughter.
Foursquare and foursquare are so fascinating to watch because of the interactions between the couples; the order they are given; the order they are not given in the way that a strategy can change an outlook.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is doing well on the last day in the lead, but this quarterfinal also showed that the US team had the will to fight, which was in doubt, especially on the Stateside.
Europe reaching the Ryder Cup final with a 10-6 record
Europe gained a healthy lead in the Ryder Cup final after a fourth ball from a Samsen in the fourth match against the USA with a 10-6 record.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari lead the match with two victories over a swinging Tiger Woods to place their lead to four points at Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, who lost the trophy two years ago at Hazeltine, dominates a poorly started American side in the quarter-finals, with the series tied 3-1.
The United States is more resistant in the fourth, winning two games, but they're not getting the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from 12 games a Sunday to win the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European starter to score four points in a row while at Molinari, together Molliwood after a sensational weekend becoming only the second pair to score four points since the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
Against Woods and Patrick Reed in the quarter-final, they are well-harmonised against a vain Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau in a friendly 5&4.
Woods, who has been self-taught by two matches at Samsen, has occasionally shown brilliant breaks in the fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was suspended from the quarter-finals on Monday, returned to play Henrik Stenson in the fourth and followed by 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe is not just having it on a beautiful, sunny day in the southwest of Paris.
The three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the American record with two points at Samsen.
They reaped a gravely 2&1 victory over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals and later came back to win against the Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourth despite losing the first two laps.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four point deficit to win in the singles, although Fury's side only needs to contribute to retaining the trophy.
After they were second-guested for two days, as always, a counterattack on Sunday looked unwanted by them.
North Korea says they would be unarmed without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen distrust of the US and there was no way North Korea would unilaterally arm its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting that North Korea has shown a lot of goodwill over the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, removing the nuclear test site, and not expanding nuclear weapons and nuclear technology further.
"No matter how, we don't see the same response from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri repeated the well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in which North Korea is rewarded for every single step, he stressed his statement in which he did not explicitly imply a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has always done in the past.
Ri refers to a joint letter by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit of a sitting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula while Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States, so Pyongyang, first had to lay down its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for easing international sanctions against North Korea.
The US insists on denuclearisation first and increases pressure through sanctions to impose itself in a compelling way, and challenges the declaration of the end of war, Ri said.
The perception that sanctions could force us to our knees is a tragedy of the people who don't know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our distrust.
Ri said nothing about plans for a second summit to test Kim and Trump, who had previously challenged a US leader to the United Nations.
However, the minister has highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and said: "If the party for denuclearization were South Korea and not the US, denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be such a mess".
In fact, Ri's speech sounded dramatically different from last year's speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korean missiles were fired at the US mainland by President Trump, who called Kim a suicide bomber.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to destroy North Korea completely, praised Kim for his courage in taking the first steps towards disarmament, but said that much work remains and sanctions must remain until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council: The continuation of sanctions by the UN Security Council must continue and at least be delayed until we achieve a complete, definitive and proven denuclearization.
The Security Council has since 2006 unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, hoping that by deploying funds they could discourage Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met Ri behind the scenes at the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyan next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times in that year, but his latest visit has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea had denounced his gangster requests.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and even a nuclear complex should the Americans take appropriate measures.
He said Kim would use appropriate measures to ensure that he seeks security guarantees that Trump has assured Singapore and a return to normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students choose courts to rest enough.
A new court at Harvard University is urging all its students to get more sleep and try to combat the growing macho culture of staying up all night with caffeine in the blood.
One academic found that students at the number one university in the world often have no idea what it means to look after themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, has convened the court, which is the first of its kind in America.
He was inspired to start the court after giving a discussion about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"After the fourth day of the year, a young woman came to me and asked,' Why am I born this way at this early age? '
He said that no one had told him about the importance of sleep until now, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which will be offered for the first time this year, explains to students the essential ways in which good sleep habits can help academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business manager of the university's health services, said the university decided to appeal the decision after realizing that students were experiencing a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The hour-long course offers a range of interactive tasks.
In part, a picture of a bedroom is shown where students can click on coffee tables, bars, sports bars and books and then learn about the effects of caffeine and caffeine, but also how sports performance of sleep is affected and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, the researchers learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to reflect on their daily routine.
We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of the students right away.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know what health problems cigarette smoking brings, Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of teaching all night long is still alive, professors say, and the growing technology and pressure on students is a consequence of sleep deprivation and a growing problem.
He said that ensuring adequate quality sleep should be a kind of secret weapon against stress, overwork and anxiety, even to prevent one from adding to the burden of sleep deprivation and hunger and feeling hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the court, even after he had chosen one of his courses the previous year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to present the case to the entire university.
Here, in a next step, we hope to get all PhD students to complete a similar study programme before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm when they should go to bed, but also to get up, and to pay attention to the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs that can cause rhythm disturbances throughout the day and lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1  0 Rangers: goal by Menga beat team by Gerrard
Rangers suffered further defeat by Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's little side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox side tried to secure their first match since the 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side brought Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as coach and left him eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leaders, the Heart of the Pot.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' line-up felt inspired and could not keep up.
While the Rangers now slide to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian by the difference in goals.
And there could be further problems for the Rangers after Abiter Calum Spence was treated for a head injury, apparently from an object shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard switched sides eight times, which allowed him to leave Ayr behind and reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, picked the same Livi 11, which gave the Hearts a point last week and was excited to see his well-rounded team beat their opponents every turn.
While the Rangers held the ball more often, Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They could have scored a goal within two minutes of the game, as Menga's first pass led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder took his big chance too far.
A deep free kick from Keaghon Jacobs to captain Craig Halkett only allowed Alan Lithglow to shoot from a distance at the posts in the defensive.
The Rangers were able to gain control, but it looked more like hope than faith in their last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that they had been left a quarter of an hour behind when they ran into the Steven Lawless arena, but Abbot Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers scored just twice in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problem defending Lassana Coulibaly's cap shot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one can claim that they didn't deserve it for their efforts alone.
The Rangers also agreed to a standard position by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept a cold head and selected Menga for a simple goal.
Gerrard reacted in the break and started the coup against Ryan Kent, which had a direct impact when the outsider overcame Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with the exact genre of game they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after another.
The Holt's side could have continued to exploit their advantage and the occasional moments, but McGregor kept the Jacobs' bass before the Lithgow shot a corner from a distance.
The Rangers selected Glenn Middleton a further time later to a right on an eleven-foot as he went along with Jacobs, but Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac The Originator of Geiger
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30th, 1882, exactly 136 years ago, and still more targeted... the fastest physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the Geiger target.
The Geiger goals, since a major support of science, have also become a pillar of pop culture. In 1950, the film Bells of Colorado was released, starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who looked more like cowboys than scientists:
Man: What is that?
Rogers: This is a geyser target used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you hear the earphones, you can hear the effects that the atoms emit from the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: So, it's going to be safe now!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention named after him is alive.
New cancer vaccines can help the immune system detect malignant cells
New cancer vaccines can help the immune system detect and kill cancer cells
Vaccination helps the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and then converting them into a laboratory
They can then identify a protein that is present in many cancer cells and then re-inject it
A trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
In a woman who was treated with the vaccine, which helps the immune system detect malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared after more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, then transforming them in the lab to detect a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then replenishing the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, says: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.
HER2 drives the growth of various cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and pancreas, as explained by Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and adding them to them, like attacking cancer cells, has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tirade, with a MAGA cap, after his performance on SNL.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was featured in the studio during Saturday Night Live, following a long-running performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for President in 2020.
After singing his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, he wore a cap with the tagline Make America Great, protested against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
I have often spoken to white people and they say, "How can you love Trump, a racist?"
So if I was concerned about racism, I would have been out of America for a long time.
SNL began the broadcast with a sketch featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star jokes about Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee accusing Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment.
Although not broadcast, West's tirade has been uploaded via social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether the Rock tried to make fun of the West with his posts.
West also complained to the audience that he had backstage problems because of his cap.
They bullied me backstage.
They told him not to go out with the cloak.
They bullied me!
And then they said I was drowning, as the Washington Examiner said.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the whole place?" followed by a statement that "she's going to wear her Superman costume, so no one can tell me what to do.
Try to love.
His comments were at least twice taken by the audience and the SNL staff seemed embarrassed, as Variety writes, and one person told the publication:
West replaced singer Ariana Grande, who had died two days earlier, as a result of a falling out with fellow rapper Mac Miller.
The West irritated others with the performance of the song I love it, wanting to see how a Perrier bottle was made.
West has been supported by the conservative TPUSA group's fourth chairman, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous heads:
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is just who it is, and that's absolutely amazing.
I choose to DOGEINT reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or their art) who I suspect is spreading a harmful ideology that might be doing something to my community.
Here is free.
But we are too, they said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and would now be calling the artist formerly known as Kanye West.
He is not the first to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, was named Snoop Lion and of course the later music legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then called himself the artist previously known as Prince.
Searching for a murderer over knife cutting in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened at Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant will be heard by the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The points of the accusation are being examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks harmful masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his starring role as Jon Snow in the HBO brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of a macho hero, saying that such roles on screen often make young men feel they have to mimic the strong man to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he was cheating that something went wrong and asked how to address the problem of harmful masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admits they are "very hard on the subject".
I feel very strong, personally, at the moment, where they are going with the masculinity of the ship.
What have we done to men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly to blame for the spread of harmful masculinity, precisely because of its extremely masculine characters.
"What is the teaching? " they asked".
What is taught on television and in the streets that young men are supposed to be on the opposite side of men?
I doubt that this is really one of the big questions of our time  how do we change that?
Well, there's definitely something wrong with young men.
In the interview, he also admits that he does not want to do a fourth or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he has enough battlefields and horses.
From November, the Kit is worth watching in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor has said that he is learning from his wife Rose the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
I met my wife in your series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on, she said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the request of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
China announced that the number of people living with HIV or AIDS has increased by 14%.
Health experts say more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Of the 40,000 new cases, only in the second quarter of 2018 were reported.
The majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, which is a significant difference.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood transfusions in parts of China.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Over the next year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted are caused by inadequate protection and relationships.
Since 2003, China has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that Matuworker leaked GOP senators' files, speaks of dangerous lies and conspiracy theories
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denied Saturday's rumors that a member of her Matu workers posted personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the legislators' Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims of "extreme change" figures and websites were being celebrated.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published also appears to have included private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, uploaded by an anonymous person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators asked Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the alleged offender had a link to Waters' office, and they released information about a member of Waters' staff, the lawmakers told The Hill.
These unfounded claims are completely false and an absolute lie, says Waters.
The member of my staff  whose identity, personal information, and safety and security are the result of these false and misleading claims  had absolutely nothing to do with the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Waters' statements quickly gained online criticism, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This dementia is furious", wrote the meatman.
It suggests that she does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If a man is accused of committing a crime that he has not committed, he shall not be put to shame.
It is not to be defied.
No one should question the reason for the murder.
It must be calm and balanced.
Fleischer demonstrated to compare Waters' reaction to criticism by Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being angry during the hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is worth standing against the water and the midterm elections, also shared his opinion on Twitter.
"Great if true", he tweeted.
In this statement, DWater said that its office has informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement officials about these false claims.
We will make sure that your guilt comes to an end, she continued, and that they will be held responsible for actions here that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my office.
Johnny English Strikes Again criticism  little intoxicating Rowan Atkinson parody
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit performances in all new British films, which is not appropriate in the revival of the Johnny English action comedy parody franchise.
Is this ironic self-satire, which obviously makes us stupid, an export opportunity for this nation?
Regardless, the gullible and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his patent for a second time to blow everything up  his name says enough, that it is a broadly-based comedy creation designed for non-English-speaking filmmakers in other territories.
Here is of course a stupid secret agent who, although he has a strange accent for idiots glamour, has a bit of clouseau, a stroke of Mr Bean and a bell from the guy who gave a single note to the Chariots of Fire lead singer at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
Here is actually based on the traveling and international Man of Mystery, who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart TV commercials, and who left chaos everywhere.
There are a couple of good moments in this current Johnny English movie.
I was fascinated by the scene of Johnny English coming to a helicopter, wearing a medieval suit of armor, while the rotating helicopter blades were flickering against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is to be seen, but the humor feels overwhelming and sometimes overwhelming, especially with the likes of 007 and Mission Impossible now offering more attention to comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's meant for kids and not adults, and for me Johnny English's stupid misadventures are just not as original and focused as Atkinson's dumb sketch of the Bean person.
The constant current premise is that the UK is now in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the top-secret Internet spy network in the UK revealing the identities of all agents in the Assaz, unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop that brings the fuss to the prime minister, a pompous and struggling figure who is already witnessing a total collapse of political unrest: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Theresa May character, but there isn't much in the script that one could work with.
Here, they inform the secret police that every spy in danger is forced to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now employed as a school principal by a distinguished establishment, who gives home-grown courses like becoming a spy: some nice jokes here, English wants to set up an art school of rock-influenced spy school.
English has been dispatched back to Whitehall for a brief briefing in Urgency and reunited with his old-time sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role and the Vicki Pepperdine is being wasted a little.
Batman and Robin are the ones who are doing everything wrong in the name of His Majesty's Secret Service and are getting to know Olga Kurylenko's Female Fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is in danger of falling for a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and de Bough begin an odyssey of farce-out maneuvers: dressed as servers, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create chaos off Volta's luxury yacht; and English leave some anarchy as they attempt to wear a virtual reality headset to familiarize themselves with Volta's house.
All the sketches are definitely taken out for the last sequence, but so friendly and burschoos everything, it already has something of a children's TV in it.
It's very modest.
And like the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for the British to cut down on a four-day week paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan whereby Britons work four days a week but are paid for five.
The party apparently wants the heads of companies to return the savings they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence to the workers through an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend but were paid.
Sources say the idea would align with the parts of this economic agenda and also boost the country's economy and workers' welfare.
The shift to a four-day workweek is supported by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of the policy is due to be announced by the end of the year.
It is not worth taking overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy and employee benefits and the party's general industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to come up with such an idea, as the Greens had already spoken out in the 2017 election campaign for a four-day week.
But this aspiration is not currently supported by the whole Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to articulate his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said they were determined to seize the power of "faceless dictators" and "profiteers" of "supporting companies".
The Chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies will not be able to raise any investment here if a Labour government could demand certain deductions on the basis of wrong practices.
Heen also confirmed plans to place jobs at the level of companies and the so-called Inclusive Ownership Fund to pay 10% of profits of private sector companies to workers who could then receive annual dividends of up to £500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy say 60 minutes, if the Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a random vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI's findings could convince Republican senators to give their support.
In an interview with Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything new that would bring them to change their minds.
Kennedy worked more closely than his fellow South Carolina colleague.
"I'm wrong, of course", Kennedy said.
When I entered the audience, I told them I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
So I called them after this happened, and when the money came out, I said, 'Do you have it?'
He was determined, determined, once.
But Graham's vow is written in stone.
"I have a strong opinion on the Kavanaugh board and there must be a particularly strong proposal to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied it", Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
And they can't verify anything about anyone they call.
It's been 36 years.
I see nothing new that could change the situation.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the Global Citizen Festival is again held, an annual music event that has an immensely impressive lineup of performing stars but an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival attracts thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only see music acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), people who attend the concert must perform a number of tasks, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling someone or other tasks that help end poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been, with only 12 years left to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an honest way to ask people to become active or to re-engage in another case of click activism?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 11 million actions by their supporters, which are aimed at different goals.
They say these actions have helped them get global leaders to announce commitments and promote policies worth more than $37 billion that will help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group cited 390 commitments and reports resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the money raised has so far impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments, including The Power of Nutritution, is a UK-based partnership of investors and traders committed to helping children reach their full potential, promising to give Rwanda $35 million to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizen.
With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social inequities of undernourishment a footnote in history,Power of Nutritution Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience of the live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that more than 5,000 actions were addressed to the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government had announced financial support for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which is worth reaching more than 5 million women and children with nutritional support.
In response to a FAQ on the website that asks what makes you think you can end up in extreme poverty?
Global Citizen responded: "It's worth a long and hard road, but sometimes we fail.
But like all the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, if we succeed, we want to be stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just a few of the artists to perform in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
US could use a naval blockade to restrict Russian energy exports
Washington said they would use the Navy here if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, as US Secretary of Interior Ryan Zinke has betrayed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinc claims that Russia's involvement in Syria, where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government, is only a platform for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they want to be in the Middle East, just like they are in Eastern Europe and in the southern part of Europe, they want to use energy", he apparently said.
And if you can believe in him, there are always ways to do that.
"The United States of America has the ability to, with our Navy, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that energy does not enter the market", said the president.
Zinc was addressed to participants in the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an American NGO that sees itself as the voice of energy consumers.
Here, he compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they are ultimately the same.
The economic options for Iran and Russia are turning, more or less, to exert pressure to replace fuel, he said, while in the context, he sees Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The allegations come as the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, which is a much more volatile option for European consumers.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Dashield to withdraw from the "inappropriate" "North Stream 2" pipeline project, which would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow if Trump were to be heard.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that this is an example of unfair competition.
I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of easing pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The DUS attitude was met with criticism from Germany, which once again reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The first major industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on America to withdraw from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a big problem with a third country interfering with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is worth checking out if she's running for president in 2020, said the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "see if she can run for president after the midterm elections".
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and look at our fucked-up government and that means a woman at the top", she said, according to voices from The Hill.
After November 6, I'm going to have to look into running for president.
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying he would lead the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried to the core about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been open to criticising Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren said that "we obviously need an FBI investigation before we get elected".
A study was released on Thursday, but it shows that Warren's own election won't disappoint her in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eighty-five percent of likely Massachusetts residents feel they should not run.
Thirty-two percent thought it was a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support for the governor of Vidrun, Deval Patrick, with thirty-eight percent supporting his resignation and forty-eight percent opposing it.
Other high-profile Democrats named in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide by January to step down, the Associated Press wrote.
Sarah Palin mentioned Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event to the track
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after joining in September.
Here, the monthly evening is arrested and charged for domestic violence
"What my son has been through, what he has been through since he came home, I can share with other families struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries our soldiers are coming back to", she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her arrest the elephant in the room and said her son and other veterans come back a little different, they're harder, they come back and they wonder if there's respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and any other members of the military, have been doing.
Here, the man in Wasilla, Alaska, is arrested and charged with domestic violence against a woman, along with the report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon in an alcoholic state, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C., supporting a new asylum policy
Eleven states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new US policy banning asylum for victims of gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states in the district have issued a memo amicus curiae ( ami de la cour ) in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions ruling, which the American Civil Liberties Union launched against federal policy in August, has not been made public.
She said that her partner and her violent gang members had been abused, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states advocating for Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations with constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that gave undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence the opportunity to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, District of Columbia's Attorney General, said in a statement Friday that the new policy would ignore state law, federal law and international law.
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be submitted in accordance with the facts and circumstances of the application, and such a court is in violation of that principle, says ami de la cour.
Lawyers continue to argue in their memoirs that the policy would not allow immigrants to enter, which would harm the US economy, if they were likely to become entrepreneurs, and a significant offer of workers.
Advocate General Jeff Sessions called in June for judges to grant asylum only to victims who seek to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of their race, religion, nationality or want to be members of a particular social group or political opinion, the session said on 11 June in its policy statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll doubles compared to survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more hopeless.
"Everything feels tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, as she tried to calm her five-year-old baby in the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every minute an ambulance brings in dead bodies.
There is hardly any clean water.
Residents were seen returning to the ruined homes, looking for reasonable owners to save them.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the Judge scale were overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulders, grazed outside Palus Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to the ongoing bruises.
When he told the story of how he felt in the fifth floor hotel room where he shared a violent earthquake with his wife and daughter, he cried out in tears.
There was no time to save us.
I was crushed by the ruins of the walls, I'm sorry", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what's wrong with this or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of bullying with propaganda
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement praising the benefits of US-China trade with each other in a US-American newspaper, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press for propaganda purposes.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited Chinese-funded ads in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after a Chinese official claimed they were trying to participate in the November 6 congressional elections, which China denied.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in US elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to pressure China, according to a US official.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercial advertising, Beijing and Washington are in the midst of a de-escalation trade war, which has led to higher tariffs on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were supposed to hit exporting states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporting state to China, says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to prosper.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, is now lending another ship by now running propaganda ads in our free press.
By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is going against the long-established tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register, the industry city wrote.
In contrast, the newspaper stand down the street in Beijing is a little bit of an opposition vote and doesn't deserve a proper reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese might have against the economic development of their country if the media were to be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,he wrote.
He also said that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers did not want to print his article, but they did not know how.
Republicans are distancing themselves from women's elections ahead of the debate on the Kavanaugh, analysts warn
While many top Republicans behind Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh stand in defense of various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a backlash in the election, especially from women.
The sentiment on this issue was extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
These things cannot be reversed, said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse Universitys Maxwell School, who spoke to The Hill for an article published Sunday.
The Reporter said Senator Jeff Flake (R  Arizona)'s last-minute pressure to have an FBI investigation only worth bringing angry voters with him.
Women don't forget what happened yesterday They don't forget tomorrow and not in November, said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, who believes a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The Freedoms chanted "November is coming!" as they fled the Senate, while the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to a Mic-Report.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely valuable", Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"They say it was already high; " and that is true.
But it could go even higher, especially among the so-called female swing voters, and the fourth generation and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who, although they disliked the president, often did not vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which she gives a detailed description of the sexual assault against Supreme Court nominees, analysts suggest that it could be reversed if Republicans continue to accept confirmation.
"This is a confusing confusion for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former Republican National Committee chairman, early last week, according to NBC News.
It's not just the committee vote or the ballot or whether Kavanaugh will be the judge, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they handled it, Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps Democrats get elected, told a television station.
But Americans seem to be somewhat divided about what to believe of the statements by Ford and Kavanaugh, although there is a tendency to believe the worst.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's statement, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely ran during his statement, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations of Ford and at least another female offender, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominated candidates at a party exposed their genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans a new Internet to fight Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, started a startup that was supposed to be a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's recent project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored and who can access water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind the interruption was world domination.
"We need to do it now", he said of the start-up.
It's a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to store their own personal online data store or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all on the same browser, and they're all on the same page.
What is unique about personal online data stores is that it is completely up to the user who can access what information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data".
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, build skills and appropriate resources to make this solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, a few Matu employees working as developers on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
From that week on, technology developers around the world could create their own decentralized app using the tools found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should make a complete change, where all these business models are being overlooked overnight.
We're not asking for permission here.
In a post to Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to deliver commercial energy to an ecosystem that is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new Web on solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Although he founded Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
I am extremely optimistic about the new era of the web, added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: First World War pastor celebrated with a Victoria cross
The only Church of England clergyman to ever receive a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a fighter was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt Col The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was shot four days later by a sniper and never realized he was being attacked by the highest British military rank.
A commemorative stone was unveiled by a pair of his grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it would be "geniusly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his bop, who had robbed him of his medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through heavy fog and under attack in the field and by machine guns.
He then ran to the shoulder line and led the battalion again, before taking a field gun with one hand and taking three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that he could never justify his grandfather's actions, but it was a humble experience.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade that led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he feels very honoured to be part of the parade and also said that the courage of a true hero is proven by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching the Bellator 206 and got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine that you've been up all night watching a packaged Bellator 206, only to be denied the main course's keys.
The schedule featured 13 matches from San Jose, including six on the main map and were shown live all night on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6am, just as Guard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to go head-to-head, spectators in the UK were stunned when the news was changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unimpressed after being extra vigilant for the fight until the early hours of the morning.
One fan described the turn on the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's a government ordinance that at 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", said David Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, yeah".
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they wanted to revise their schedule to accommodate UK viewers in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think we can probably do that", Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock there on Sunday morning and we're not able to move this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
I believe that when it was reported, many came and sent here, but not all of them were friendly.
We tried to stop this, we thought it was a technical disruption.
But there was no problem, there was a legal problem.
I can assure you, next time, it won't happen again.
We're reducing the fight to 5 instead of 6  as we always do  and we've tried to deliver more to the fans, but we've failed.
It is a deplorable situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "humanly unworthy" of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he was raised to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not realize until he was in secondary school that "no one is like me".
In an interview with Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent has made him less likely to win the Olympics.
The longtime host of the show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During her appearance as a guest on Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up he felt "worth being a man" like everyone else because "loving boys and girls was socially unacceptable".
He said: "Until now, those who felt inferior and inferior were the only things that gave us strength and endurance to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "worth something", so that he would not be disappointed if they finally found out his sexual preferences.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is one of the most prominent LGBT advocates and he used his performance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he said this because he felt happy, able, open and free to live without consequences and wanted to make another "hope".
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" to fall in love with a man  the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young, you're through so much", he said, "He went to his first Olympics when he was a year old and his father died of cancer three years later". He said it was hard to find someone as old as him who went through the same heights and depths.
The couple became parents of a young man named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been 'I need to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son shares the same name as his father Robert, who died of ovarian cancer in 2011 at age 40.
Daley said his father would not have accepted that he would die and one of the last things he asked was if they already had their tickets to London 2012  because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I could not tell him that you were not there to sit in the front row", he replied.
"I held his hand when he stopped vomiting and it was only when he stopped vomiting and was dying that I finally admitted that he was not invisible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that it was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a crowd at the Olympics at home, there's no better feeling", he said.
This also inspired the choice of his first song  Pride of Heather Small  which he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympics and still causes a brain injury in him.
Desert Island Discs is on Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson, a Ryder Cup player, on the bench on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson set a record on Sunday when he played his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to get back in shape to avoid an unfortunate mail-in.
Mickelson, who plays for a record 12th time at the event, which takes place every two years, was sent off by captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day playing cheerleader and working on his game on the range, in the hope of improving what he was planning.
Not even at the peak of his career was he the most feared driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal crew for the tight course of Le Golf National, where the long rough routinely punishes felt-guided shots.
And if the grounds are not enough, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who will team up with starter Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans are four points behind the 12 singles players, and have a difficult start, Mickelson's game could prove to be absolutely important.
The angry woman confides to her husband, and he can't say anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, he slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he was ready tomorrow", said the Furious.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's on the best list and he's contributed so much to this team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine he would play two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it worked and how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else out there".
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never really reached the heights of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, but Fury said his presence has brought the team far less tangible benefits.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's lazy, he's got a lot of fun in him and he's a wonderful guy who likes to be in the team room", he explained.
"I think the younger players enjoyed being with him, and also this week, which was fun and exciting.
He offers far more than just games".
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead for the last day's Ryder Cup singles can quickly turn into an uncomfortable red.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side with captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it won just after midnight with 141⁄2:131⁄2 points.
"You always remember that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline where we lost, and at Valderrama where we won, but only a little", Bjorn said, reflecting on his 2018 class victory both Friday and yesterday with 5:3 to lead Le Golf National with 10:6.
So history will show me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Go all in tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
This isn't over until you see the dots on the bride.
We have a goal and that is to try and win these trophies, and that's what we have to keep focusing on.
I've been saying it all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side -- the best players in the world".
Relieved when his players were beaten on a rough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never be in the front row.
Tomorrow we have another beast ahead of us.
Tomorrow is the same work, and that's another pair of shoes.
It's great to be out with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out alone, you're tested to the point of being a golf player.
That's the message that you have to give the players: Go your best tomorrow.
Now let your companion go, and he will go and give him his goods".
Unlike Björn, his opponent Jim Furyk wants his players to beat each other better than they did as partners, the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three out of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of these big twists, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before they lost the spot as Europe played the "Wonder of Medina".
"I remember everyone's damn word about it", he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, collected his players before the final day.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you'd like to have the early start you saw in Brooklyn, you saw in Medina.
If the pendulum is swinging in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the middlemen.
We have arranged our meeting and arranged the meeting, as if we were going to be able to make a spell tomorrow".
Thomas was given the task of trying to make the offer and facing Rory McIlroy in the main role, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other European in the other half of the lineup.
"I chose this set because I think it covers everything", Bjorn said of his individual choices.
The new German warship is back in the water
The latest German Navy frigate was ordered in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but it will not be completed until at least next year, according to local media, due to faulty systems and ever-increasing costs.
The order for the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the Baden-Württemberg frigate class, has now been published until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have turned the fate of the ambitious project home.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They have a powerful gun, a range of air and space rockets, as well as disguise technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods. It should be possible for the latest frigates to not reach the home port for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean that the innovative warships  which are to prove Germany's superior strength and superiority  are already obsolete before entering service at all, notes "Die Zeit".
The F125 frigate, which was haunted by the tragedy, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for the crash were little known, but the German media described a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships were operated by a crew of almost 120 sailors - almost half the staff of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhine Land Pack" is said to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class that the Germans used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project  including the training of the team  is also a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the original €2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are mainly due to recent warnings that the German Navy is losing ground.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was "giving out the eligible ships".
The official said the problem had worsened over time as old ships were being stolen but no new ships were being prepared.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates were capable of joining the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of the Flantermais
A new study, based on a landmass in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how the land used by the coral reefs to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of the unique flight observers and help to establish guidelines for future protection activities.
The study is being carried out by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and follows commonly in the brown Laangour and Daubenton flower corn at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed in important locations around the property to monitor the activities of the fern mouse throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct mobile recording using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of all the records determines the frequency of the flying mouse circles and what type of circles it does.
A map and a report of the habitat are then produced to create a detailed picture of their behaviour on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the flora and how they are used by each species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as how best to care for the herds of sage and for wildlife for flowering plants and other similar species.
The population of the flying mouse has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom over the last century.
They are being deceived by building and development work that results in sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Wind and lightning can also pose a risk, as can floodwaters and chemical treatments of body materials, but also attacks of house bugs.
The plants are not really blind.
But because of their nightly chase, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they go about preying on cattle.
They use a highly developed echolocation technique to eliminate insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the management of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Flanders Corn seriously.
They have ten trained experts who regularly perform recordings, sleep inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organisation has even set up Scotland's first and only dedicated wildlife reserve at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which provides habitat for eight of Scotland's ten wildlife species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says the property is the ideal landscape for them.
"Here in Threave we have a wonderful area for flowering corn", he said.
"We have the old buildings, the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there is still much we do not know about corn, and the work we do here and elsewhere helps us to better understand what they need to get rid of".
He stressed the importance of searching for flowering plants before maintenance is carried out on land, as unintentional destruction of a single breeding habitat could kill up to 400 females and young flowering plants and potentially trigger a whole local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, called on the public to jump in to help.
They said, "We still have a lot to learn about corn and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are affected".
Ronaldo denies rape charges and his lawyers want to sell the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charge against him a "fake news" saying people "want to make themselves known" by using his name.
His lawyers are trying to sell the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the false claims.
The Portuguese and Juventus star was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid $375,000 to keep the incident from being made public, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
When he spoke to his 142 million followers in a live Instagram video hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as "false reports".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they say today is false news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They wanted to advertise themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to make my name known, but that's what they're doing.
I am a happy and very good man", the player added with a laugh.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to denounce the "Mirror" for the false allegations, which they call "unauthorized reporting of privacy suspicions", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player wants to pay compensation for "moral damage with a sum that is equivalent to the burden of violation, which will be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and the mayor returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped an anal, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
The mayor claims Ronaldo fell to his knees after an alleged incident and told him he was "99 percent" a "good guy" compared to "one percent".
The documents claim Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but that one had taken place with mutual consent.
The mayor also claims that the incident was reported to the police and that he had photos of his injuries that were shot in the hospital, but later agreed to solve the case amicably because he was "greatly afraid of retaliation" and feared being "publicly discouraged".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to get the marriage annulled because she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged overthrow and this summer he was traded to Italian top-flight club Juve for a fee of $100 million.
Brexit: UK "readiness to lose car manufacturers forever"
The United Kingdom "will be ready forever" if it loses its status as a world-leading carmaker, said Economy Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "disconcerting" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will be stopped", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are the carmaker's assessment of the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run "finishing synchronously", with parts being delivered to customers every 37 minutes for cars ordered from both the UK and EU.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a disruption at the border that could lead to delays and parts purchases, according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep a stock of more than a day at the factory in Derbyshire, the company said, thus stopping production.
Mr Clark told Theresa May her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a deal, we want the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"The statement not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must necessarily be able to lead the way, which has been an extremely successful supply chain".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run they warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and cost jobs in the end.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union boss at the factory, said that his members are increasingly worried: "From experience I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have developed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump-Rosenstein meeting will be postponed, according to the White House, possibly again
Donald Trump's controversial meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "spoiled a week later" as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of the Sun Belt activist Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian election interference, ties between Trump supporters and Russia and a potential presidential obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump has impeached the Deputy Attorney General and thus jeopardized Mueller's independence has been the number one topic of conversation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken about being coerced into recording talks with Trump and about the possibility of impeaching the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report.
But on the last day of the month he went to the White House and was reportedly in the house.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "leave Rosenstein out", but you were told to avoid a cross-over with the Senate Judiciary Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, whom he accused of sexual misconduct, both ruled out.
On Friday, Trump launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh that delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meetings, she replied: "There is no date yet set for it, it could be this week, and I might have to postpone it another week, with all the other things going on at the Supreme Federal Court.
But we still see that, and I always like to keep the press up to date".
Some reporters questioned the claim: Sanders has not held a White House press briefing since September 10.
The host Chris Wallace asked.
Sanders said the lack of information was not due to a dislike of television reporters for "effect humor", although she admitted: "I do not deny the fact that they are making an impact".
She suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president holds more R&D meetings than any president before him", she said, adding, without evidence, "We've looked at the numbers".
Information rallies are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president questions directly, it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you see, we've done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and that's going to replace a press briefing in the future when you talk to the president of the United States".
Trump regularly answers questions about whether he will leave the White House or attend open meetings or attend press conferences with weather forecasts.
Press conferences alone are the soul.
In New York, the president may have proved this week by making a labyrinthine and bizarre performance in front of the gathered reporters.
Health Minister to send EU staff to NHS Scotland over Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to remain there after Brexit.
The Scottish Parliament member, Jeane Freeman, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the cost of a contract for regulated status for EU citizens working in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The summer has passed, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been underway and decisions are expected for this fall.
But the UK government has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that these times must be troubling for all of you.
That is why I now want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the work of healthcare, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay".
Emergency operation for Christion Abercrombie after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie had an emergency operation following a head injury in the 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Mike organ of the Tennessee Air Force reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury happened shortly before halftime.
"He came to the side and collapsed", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff loaded the Abercrombie with oxygen on the side of the line and put him on a beer and brought him to Hanne for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that the Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center surgery.
Harris added that there were "no details yet on the nature/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
This is Abercrombie, a sophomore in college athletics, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp taxes when buying a basic unit in the UK
Foreign buyers have to pay higher stamp fees when buying a piece of land in the UK, with the additional tax under the Tory plan being used to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
The stamp duty increase is paid to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Finance experts expect to raise £120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees when buying a piece of land in the UK, with the additional tax under the Tory plan being used to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, attract young voters with promises, provide more affordable housing, and target well-deserved people.
The stamp duty increase is being used by individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the additional money is being used to strengthen the government's fight against sleeping on the road.
The additional tax  which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on second-hand and buy-for-lease homes  could threaten to rise to 3%.
Financial experts expect the move to be worth £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-UK residents, driving prices and lighting and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foothold in real estate.
Many wealthy areas in the country  especially in the capital  are becoming "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new guidelines come just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty to help younger people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the prices of raw materials high by buying land but not using it, and he pressured Mrs May to waive quotas on affordable homes to call for "housing reform" by the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a significant round of housing reform proposals, including rental controls and an end to forced evictions "without cover".
He also wants to give the people more authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would use my term as Prime Minister to revive the British dream that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing the fuzzy housing market.
The UK is always open to people who live, work and build their lives here.
It can't be true that it's for people who don't live in the UK, and also for foreign companies, to buy housing like British beer.
For too many people, the dream of being away from home is far too far away and the frustration of sleeping on the road remains far too real".
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to run Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland manager one day.
The 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of re-affirming the North-East club, which is just third in League One, three points clear of the top spot.
He joined the club this summer at the Stadium of Light after returning to St Mirren in the Scottish Premiership (Scotland's 1st League) last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Sports Sound in Scotland.
"But I grew up watching many games from Scotland to Hampden with my father as a child, and that's something that always drew me back.
But the opportunity would only come if I were successful in managing the club".
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says he was not afraid to follow established names at such a big club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success is measured by the question: 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it is undoubtedly in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself successful if I could get the club back there".
Ross has only three years of experience as manager, after a stint as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months with coaching staff at Hearts.
He then helped Alloa to rise from the top flight to the third tier and St Mirren from the top flight to the championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a real divorce", he recalls when he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was the right thing for me to do, to play more.
It sounds weird, but I've been doing well, living well, and enjoying some grounded highs.
But playing can be hard.
There are many things to do each week.
I still do this as a stress and pressure from work, but management just feels right.
I always wanted to manage, and now that I do, it feels like the best thing I've done in my entire adult life".

The perfect time for a pint is according to a study Sunday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the demands of British pubs fighting for survival, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in July, but revenues in restaurants fell 4.8 percent, the figures show.
Peter Martin of the consultancy firm CGA, who summarized the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer-than-expected World Cup participation resulted in July following a similar pattern as June, when pubs had 2.8 percent higher turnover, except restaurants suffered even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in June's restoration worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where people drink are cutting much harder than the restaurants outside.
Pubs and restaurants have also suffered under the sun, though not as dramatically as the restaurant operators.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
In all the pubs and bars that were run, sales of alcohol increased by 6.6 percent that month, while sales of food fell by three percent".
Paul Newman of leisure and hotel industry analyst RSM said: "The results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of large social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales on the overseas market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a sales decline of 4.8 percent year-on-year is in addition to the sustained box pressure.
The long, extremely hot summer could not have been a worse time for food business operators, and time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we had in August are bringing about the much anticipated recovery".
Sales in all pubs and restaurants, including new ones, rose 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand new ones.
The sales monitor of the industry Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the United Kingdom, collects and analyses data from 47 operators groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some of whom are now 11, has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rise in "false Insta" sites
The news sparked fears that sexual content would be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" that they showed their parents
One in five children, or about 11 children, creates social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid increase in "false Insta" accounts  a post on the photo rights website Instagram.
The news sparked fears that sexual content would be posted.
Twenty percent of students said they would run a reputable "main account" that they show their parents while also having a private one.
A mother who came across the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who shouted, "Rape me".
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, half of whom would have admitted to running private accounts.
HMC president Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle is named "Sportsman of the Year" by Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual general meeting of the Supervisory Board.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated light athlete and the future Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those who practice the sport to benefit from their extensive experience at international level in the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the athletics community throughout Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we were to join the committee", says Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be a spokesperson for the sport and I hope that I can really contribute and help bring the sport to Scotland".
The American, who won the 200 and 400-meter dash at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and has won four Olympic gold medals in total, and is now a regular BBC expert, cannot walk again after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it only became clear over time whether and to what extent I was recovering.
It was hard work, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I do mobility exercises.
Thank you for the resurrection news!"
Advertising for milk pumps that compare mothers to cows is arousing fetuses online
A dairy company has launched an online ad that compares stealing mothers to chickens being squeezed, stimulating the fetus.
To launch the so-called "world's first unopened milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a non-serious music video-inspired ad to highlight the freedom that mothers can enjoy with the new pump.
Four real moms dancing in a coast full of her to a music that includes the lyrics: "Yes, I am stitching myself, but you can't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't ears, they're my breasts".
The choir continues, "Pump off, pump off, I'm feeding my babies, pump off, pump off, I'm rubbing my breasts".
The ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has generated mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it highlights the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cow milk to promote this product.
Just like we have to get them pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away a few days after birth", one wrote.
The milk pump Elvie discreetly fits into the stool sockets (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But why don't they use it to apply for a milk pump for mothers who are nursing their babies?"
Another added, "This is a bad advertisement".
Others defended the commercial, while one mother admitted that she found the song "very strange".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I still wanted to steal.
I felt like a cow because of the pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it exactly as it was intended.
This is a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are pumping (often at work or toilets) and feel like "cookies".
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discrete pompels placed in their boxes.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
Elvie's pump is very lightweight, has no wires or strings and fits discreetly into a chair socket, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside during the pump.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at "Mother", commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a provocative and provocative presentation.
Drawing a parallel between breastfeeding and breastfeeding, we wanted to raise the challenge of breastfeeding and demonstrate in a fun and meaningful way.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a double mom for designer Marta Jakubowski ran over the catwalk while she wore the product.
Hundreds of migrants silently evacuated to a camp near the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared risking their own ability to stay in the country by signing up to adopt a child.
The risk rose in June when federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would be required to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of children of people who volunteered to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been sentenced before.
"Less than 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal here in the country and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
We are continuing to follow these people", said Mr. Albence.
In an effort to speed up the processing of children, officials, according to the accommodation staff, have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their arrest, instead of 60 days (the previous standard).
Many are appealing via videoconferencing instead in person to a court of immigration to present their case for legal status.
Those who do not qualify for help are quickly identified.
The longer the children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which, according to shelter workers and reports that have been released from the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Lawyers have said that these concerns are exacerbated in a larger facility like Tornillo, where the signs are more likely to be overlooked because of the size of the facility, suggesting a child is struggling with it.
They added that sending children to the tent city without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to tell friends how much trauma they are struggling with could worsen.
Syria demands that the US, France and Turkey withdraw their "occupation" immediately
In advance of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country that has been going on for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally staying on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and "being treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the congregation.
Al-Moualem insisted that "the war on terror in Syria is almost over", with more than 360,000 people dead since 2011 and millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would "continue its holy struggle until we clear all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, training and advising mainly Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, al-Moualem said that the conditions for them to return were in place and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fear" that urged refugees to stay away.
"We have reached out to the international community and humanitarian organizations to alleviate these backlashes", he said.
"They are politicizing what is supposed to be a purely humanitarian problem".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to call for the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a highly acclaimed attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and the Viseur, "out".
The UN health staff de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon be convened to draft a constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Al-Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the Council should be limited to "examining the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump Won a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers likely hope, impeachment or scandal would prematurely lead to his presidency.
What a "dramatic end to a presidency that has ever happened!"
But so far, there is no sign of resentment among the viewers.
Since 2014, CNN's mainstream ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million mainstream viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with no less than 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
"This is a celebration that people are excited about because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, director of ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a prolific comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She remembered a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election.
Chauffer told him he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
Chaos is entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, White House actions could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring this is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
Yet it confirms the understanding of an informed citizen to spend six hours watching a panel discussion by experts debating Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" as the source for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 street song bomber jacket (according to The Washington Post "a sign full of superstition") and the impact of Stormy Daniel's scarecrow descriptions of Mr. Trump's, um, anatomy.
I will never see Super Mario with the same eyes as before.
"Part of what he does is making it sound like a reality show that he's bringing something to everyone every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's show with rotating cast and daily unexpected conspiracies (when you're playing the NFL, Kim Jong-un praises).
You can't afford to miss a consequence, or you can't get closer.
When I reached Lord Meat this week, it was sunny over 27 degrees on his northern coast of Kauai, but he was busy watching MSNBC and it was also recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn't get away with it, not with Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future Supreme Court in the slammer.
"I remember that I saw all the madness in my eyes and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' " the Lord told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right".

Money flows out and the tightest midterm waves for the race around the house
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th District is seeing a cash flow, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional seats that two incumbents won in a race for the same seat.
The newly renamed Pittsburgh suburb is to the detriment of Democrat Rep. Conor Lamb, who won a seat in a sunny area last spring in another district.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who is running for the seat in Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is upgraded to the new 17.
The cards were newly issued after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old cards were being manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th was a major campaign finance exchange between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name after a narrow victory in a widely watched March sunwalk for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the riding by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight lead.
The United States considered sanctioning El Salvador for supporting China, but dropped
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much resistance from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a warm-up meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw American officials from their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the department, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were assessed against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in US aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which would cut financial aid payments and target visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America have convened a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from making their way to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held and they effectively rejected any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to deliver the conference in mid-October as a signal for the administration's import plans for the meetings, diplomats said.
And the three American ambassadors are quietly back in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new news or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was held by the three US Houses, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal considerations of the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
Learning from History
Your next job message could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal disability, which is now being widely reported in public records.
Mr Mueller, as reported, wants to investigate Mr Trump's campaign with Russia on the attack on our elections.
If Congress is to be reorganized, Mr. Trump will have to show responsibility for the new composition, shortly before he will have to re-elect himself, and perhaps even a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's demise is inevitable  or that of his European equivalents.
We must all make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the length of this conflict.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler if the West had only resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and we have not seized the opportunity to prevent the years of massacres that have resulted.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and in democracy its ruthless march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who is controlling the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that he suggested last year that he had taken the president in and speculated that he was not up for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the report by The Times is flawed.
What will our reaction be if the newly requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair  or if he is sworn in to the Supreme Court despite credible accusations of sexual assault and false statements against him?
And, above all, will we be holding Mr. Trump accountable in the midterms for electing a Congress?
If we do not meet these challenges, bad times will come for democracy.
But I think we will not fail, because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika on them.
With this in my inheritance, how can I not be optimistic about our future?

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of the Rapid Vienna fight
Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday realised that the victory against Austria, after a remarkable draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury forced midfielder Graham Dorrans to miss his first game of the season since the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve better things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal are a good side", said the 31-year-old Allen.
We went to the game thinking we were going to get something and they went home with a point.
We might have known about it in the end, but, overall, a game is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
This Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be a tough match because they had a good result in their last game but with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can move on and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with all the things that happened with my injuries and the changes at the club itself but it feels good now.
The squad is good and the boys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Let us hope to pass the time and be successful.
Women can't sleep because of this fear of pension savings
Although survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to family members about it.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
"People want to be cared for by a family member, but they're not taking the steps to have that conversation", said Holly Snyder, vice president of their life insurance company Nationwide.
That's how you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to support you unless you let your wishes be known early enough.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how to get care, as choices play an important role in calculating costs.
Involve your financial advisors: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to cover the costs.
Your options for paying for your long-term care include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash value life insurance to help cover costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Avoid legal conflicts
Establish a health insurance proxy so that a person who trusts your health care provider can check your health care plan and ensure that professionals will follow your wishes in case they are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You'll need to select a person you trust to make your financial decisions and ensure that the bills are paid if the door fails.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in a written schedule so that the door is ready.
"It's not just about the financials, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What are the medicines?
Who's looking for a dog?
Look at a plan for that.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu on Friday, according to households, with the expectation that the death toll will continue to rise.
Because of the limited communication capabilities, official assistance could not obtain information from Donggala Regency, a region north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency located over 300km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Cloud mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the nearby holy coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis frequently over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Assistance Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed as many as 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in a seismic zone and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the most devastating earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong aftershocks hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
About 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Menawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Large landslides hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The storm destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily trapped thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaksa governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on suspicion of assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested for suspicion of domestic violence, allegation of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, a female acquaintance tried to call the police to correct the alleged crimes, but he took his phone away.
Palin is currently in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He was a Saturday before a court where he declared that he was "absolutely not guilty" when asked to plead guilty, the broadcaster said.
Palin is facing three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could go to jail for a year and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a jail sentence and a fine of $2000.
It's not the first time Palin has been blamed.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the foul-mouthed attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, alleging a report of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed that he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans groups for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake hit a little further from the centre of Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shores.
Federal prosecutors want a rare death sentence for NYC terrorist attack suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out the attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, and ran over pedestrians and cyclists who were in his way in Oct.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "willfully" killed eight people and "willfully" caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty, filed by the Southern District of New York.
The two charges could lead to a possible death sentence, according to a court record.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of aiding and abetting protection money laundering, which is typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack took deliberate planning, prosecutors said, and described the way Saipov carried out it as cruel, forceful and destructive.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, pain, and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIego Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug addicts but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were murdered in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told the investigator that he was feeling good about what he did, police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his cell phone, following the allegations.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the decision to consider the death penalty instead of a guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked not to envisage the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel FARAGE should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, speaking at a Tory conference today, vowed to mobilise a People's Army.
The former Union leader said politicians should be warmed by the Eurosceptics' fears, while one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbenchman Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would be already out of the country if Mr Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But the challenge for Mrs May to bring the deeply divided ranks back together is underlined by pro-remain Tories who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping her Chequers' compromise plan on the attacks by Brexiters, Remainers in the EU on track.
Allies insisted that the country should continue to fight for a deal with Brussels, despite the setbacks and should force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either its package or Chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he was going to leave the chequered because of the "Leave Means Leave" rally.
He suggested that the Lord should give Farage a peer and take responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he had been going to lead us, we would have gone out now.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I am for Brexit but we must get the chequered out".
To make his opposition to the EU clear, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone has suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: the idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is completely wrong.
The Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkyns was also at the march, and told the journalists: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who really go through the streets and lead us to be elected at all.
When I love let chequers fall and start listening.
In a press release to Ms May, it added: "Primeers keep their jobs if they keep their promises".
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must "feel the heat" if they were to leave the decision of the 2016 referendum behind.
"Now there is confidence between us, the people, and our political class", he said.
They're trying to get past Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get into this.
In a message to an enthusiastic public, he added: "I think that our political class, which is just about to leave Brexit, is feeling the heat.
We will mobilize the people's army of this country that gave us the victory of Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists have been raising banners for Tories Against Brexit after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour peer Lord Adonis has been in a fight with the Conservatives over the security issues they had with a party app when the conference began.
'These are the people who tell us that they know the IT systems and all the technology to install for Canada plus plus, for a timeless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland', he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is planning to look seriously at running for president.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was seriously considering running for president in the November election
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke to Samsen about her future during a speech at the city hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against GOP state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was the co-chairman of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He was the center of speculation that he was going to run against Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the winner in the city hall format since Trump took office.
One participant asked if she was planning to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to curse our fucked-up government, and that also meant that a woman had to be in charge.
There was an arrest after the fatal shooting of LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of basketball player Wayde Sims a Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the wedding of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET news conference.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed outside the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde ran to help his colleague and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene with a gun, and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is more familiar with the world title after the team's success gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It has become clear that the Mercedes team's success will play a big role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified Saturday ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From pole, Bottas got off to a good start and nearly took Hamilton out while defending his position in the first two legs and inviting Vettel to attack his matches.
The Vettel was the first to go into the pits and led Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the pack, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes then went to the pits and was behind the wheel when it came out, but Hamilton became the first after a wheel-to-wheel action, as the Ferrari driver unwillingly had to release the inside and risk still waiting to defend the third corner after a double over.
Max Verstappen started in the back row of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He was then the first for the majority of the race while holding his tyres to a quick finish and to take over Kimi Raikkonen to become fourth.
He finally made it to the pitch on lap 44 but he was unable to improve his pace in the final eight laps, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It's a tough roof because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me go.
The team did such an exceptional job of having one or two, Hamilton said.
That Was Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made a joke on a Saturday rally with Senator Dianne Feinstein because he insisted he had not leaked the letter to Christine Blasey Ford, who indicted Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh for sexual assault.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what the Senate is saying is that the people are "bad and ugly and unfair".
"This is one of the things that could happen in the last days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see the people who are arrogant and evil and disobedient and ungrateful", he said.
"If you look at what's being made public and leaked and then you say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember his answer...you leaked the document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I know.
I didn't leak.
But wait a minute.
We leaked...No, we didn't leak", he added while he was following the senator's voice.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied knowing the leak from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak his story", the fountain told the committee, reports The Hill.
"Hate asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as it asked.
But his denial did not go well with the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
Maybe not, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president, who continued his defense of the Supreme Court nominee who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, suggested that the Democrats would use the claims for their own purposes.
They want to take back power with all the necessary means.
They see wisdom, honesty, they don't care who they want, how they have to compete to gain power and control", Mediaite reported as saying the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars prayed for the loss in the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the back-to-back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were early on with two goals by strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie before the Giants were relegated due to Dwyer.
Francois Bouchard played for Dundee before two Lukas Lundvald Nielsen goals secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on a Friday evening.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening was at 3:35 a.m. with Kendall McFaull assisting David Rutherford while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a charged start, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and brought the game back before Matt Marquardt read Cownie's equation at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants would get a lead in the first break as he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The team then regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to the same level with a game-winning goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen lead Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and he ensured they won with his team their fifth in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are now home to Milton Keynes in their next game a Friday.
Flight deaths to ensure that hundreds of people on the plane can escape before an earthquake.
A refugee in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while trying to ensure that a plane with hundreds of people can land safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong rebels continued to plunder the area and many were caught in the nightmare of the city of Palu.
But although her colleagues fled to save her life, 21-year-old Allen Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly wobbly control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu Airport.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely depart.
He then jumped from the traffic control tower as he thought it was about to collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
The sea prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a thousand large hospitals in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"When we heard this, our hearts were broken.
Meanwhile, agencies feared the death toll could reach thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
It is expected that the number will continue to rise, as many bodies are still lying under the beds while others cannot be reached", said the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 metres high destroyed Palu, where a mass grave is held on a sunny day.
The military and transport aircraft provide aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini markets are everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing everything possible to help the survivors, but we don't know what we'll find there.
It is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you all to work day and night to complete your tasks in the context of the evacuation.
Is he ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane downed: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after plane crash in Lagun
The airline that operated the flight that took off into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man has disappeared after it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was about to land.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that it has been unable to accommodate a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local agencies, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane took to the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The agency said it was pleased that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers would remain in hospital for a Saturday and that all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact course of the incident remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was deep-sea.
"That's an extremely good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others had done it by swimming in the water that went up to the top of the ship until the safe exit of the plane that was going down.
He said the stewardesses panicked and cried that he had suffered a minor head wound.
The U.S. Navy said seamen working closely on improvements to a shipyard also helped rescue by using explosive boats to bring people ashore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicated that 111 people died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but none were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst traces the time of night and a woman was burned alive.
The prosecution concluded a Saturday's investigation into the second case of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been cited for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis
He retraced for the jury how he used a cell phone to move 29-year-old suspect Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers to sit together the night he died.
Rowlett said he received location data from many cell phone operators that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicts his statements by one, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford fired a shotgun, claiming the roof was not in town.
When investigators asked if Tellis would tell the truth when he said he was in Sandford's truck that night, Sandford said he would lie because my truck was in Nashville.
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his cell phone shortly after Chambers' death.
"He has taken his life", said the Hale.
It is scheduled that the defense will begin to make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later.

Another black?!
New York girl fucks couple for firing after a racist text message
A New York girl is accusing a couple of discriminatory dismissals after receiving a mis-adressed text from her mother, who complained that she was "after all black".
Couples deny that they are racist, and compare the plants to blackmail
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she found out that the new childcare provider, Giselle Maurice, was black as it arrived for its first day of work in 2016.
"Not long after the wedding, "Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After noticing the fake, a "unfortunate" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that the little girl who just left, an African-American, had done a bad job and that she would have expected a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her day's work and was then sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is seeking compensation from the couple for the dismissal, and is expecting compensation of about $350 per roof for the six-month job she had been living in the house she was initially hired to do but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, no one does this", he said, "and he has a post office, and he added, "I know it's discrimination.
The couple retreated against the allegations that they were racist, saying it was the sensible decision to disrupt Maurice's position, fearing they could not trust him after insulting it.
"My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people", the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
And if your children should be delivered into the hand of one with whom the fool is waiting, would it be a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
There you go.
Plasco said, comparing the allegations to "blackmail", that his wife had only given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Is he going to run after such a person?
This is not a nice way to act, the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, and they were arrested for their behavior and logic.
The Paddington relocators feared that readers might not be able to relate to a beer that speaks to a new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to get in the way of someone who reads it first before it is published.
It's very funny to know what we know about Paddington's success.
It said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, would have been angry if his work had not been accepted, adding that the 60th birthday of the books would have been "Battery Sweets" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, who describes him as "a very important family member", it says that his father was quietly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a man of sorrows", they said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like having a knack for achieving something: it's really proud of him even if it's not his own creation.
I think he saw Paddington's success a little bit in that direction.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always attributed the merit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her on the phone
After landing, his daughter and son were taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save his life.
"The Nad has called many times to say that it looks very bad, that it is not expected to get better", said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and told her she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to tell her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm the same.
I will make sense of it.
The medications doctors gave him to keep his heart beating slowly went off and left his system.
He had died a short time ago, and that was just the end.
I just have to sit there and wait, knowing that all these things are about to happen.
I could not whine or cry or cry because I was in a situation with families and people.
I really need to rap together.
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, who is grieving the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with the other passengers without knowing what to do.
"No one knew anything", she said.
"I have bowed my head, and my tears have fallen continually.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I spared a huge sympathy for Nad.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Women in mourning send out suicide prevention cards on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent out cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
I don't think any parents need to feel what I feel every day", he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son was a promising cook with a good grill.
"Everyone knew him because of his grin.
They always said that his laughter would go no matter where he was.
But he left his job before he died, because he was in a darker place.
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, who found his half-sister after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep making sure that there are consequences.
Mrs. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are people out there that you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit still you have to talk.
Mrs Humphreys, who has been in love with Mrs Davies for years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother died.
He didn't say he was feeling bad or depressed or anything", it said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that the behavior was different.
It was the last day of Christmas. When the children opened their presents, he did not look them in the eye or anything like that.
It said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to agree: "The whole family is laughing.
It's raining us apart.
But we all have to keep going and fight.
If you are having trouble agreeing, you can call the Samaritan Free to 116 123 (UK and Ireland), send an email to @samaritans.org, or visit the Samaritan website here.
Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought if we could really get something like what he asked for, a limited time-limited investigation, with limited scope, then maybe we could achieve some unity", Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid the committee would "fall apart" and become a partisan seat.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
His temperament is entirely timely.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, the Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their bid to get the man they want elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush took the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support Harry Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be an election in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can win at least 50 Senate elections, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to overcome an equality and take him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea survival numbers fall under Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea and South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker says.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the Union Ministry of the South and said there were 1,127 survivors last year  compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and higher costs of human trafficking would play a big role.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
Most of the survivors from the North will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and the easiest to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views the survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forces them back to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still technically at war with each other, have improved sharply in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks on the halted denuclearization negotiations.
This follows the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the U.S.A., there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances it will be impossible for us to first unilaterally disarm ourselves", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was not fit in his temperament to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever acted like this, they would say 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as both teenagers were emotionally challenged.
During his afflictive statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly crying or sneezing while talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a "grotesque and coordinated campaign of assassination" organized by liberals who were rushing to say that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements in the way he stood up against the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi expressed concerns when asked whether she would try to assassinate Kavanaugh if he were sworn in, and whether the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only not fit to be in the Supreme Court, but he's fit to be in the courtroom where it's right", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was considered a conservative justice.
In his remark, Kavanaugh questioned the possibility that he would default on certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, partisan person to court and then wait for us to say that's not wonderful", said Pelosi.
And women should practice it.
It is a just trial, months and years of wrath that has been overcome, and has not come out without crying.
"We cry when we're crying", we told Mrs. Stone 45 years later.
"I don't find that unusual, do you?
She goes on, and I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leader somewhere, and she said that she would cry when she cries, but that she developed a technique that means that if she cries and starts crying, then she says to the person she's talking to, "You think maybe I'm confident because I'm crying".
I'm mad at them.
And then she just kept going.
And I thought that would be brilliant.
Tears are partly allowed as a venture to anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of a previous job, in a mostly male office, where I cried out with indescribable rage, was that an old woman took me to the toilet, a cold manager, who I was always a little scared of, and pulled me down a staircase.
"Let them never see you cry", we said.
"They don't know that the rose is.
They will be sad and glad because they have found you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was listed in a successful affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the race, Mrs. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that she should not think about running for president herself.
"It was not a good decision", we said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
One called it "Snow White" and the Seven Dwarfs.
Because it was already late in the campaign, it was behind fundraising, so it swore it wouldn't go into the race unless it raised $2 million.
It was a battle that had already been lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave him just $250.
How much am I going to get a rebate? " she asked herself.
When he gave his speech and announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed with feelings of gratitude for the people who would support him, frustration with the system that makes it so difficult to raise money and target elected and non-delegated people, and anger at sexism - that it lost his voice.
"One might think I had a nervous breakdown", recalls Mrs. Schroeder's reaction to the press.
Someone would have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what will they write on my grave?
Did he cry?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first wave of the US-China trade war has been a fluke, and while the fighting is still in progress, a break between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warnings earlier this year by taxing a major Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week was with new tariffs hitting $200 billion worth of property, resulting in half of all goods coming from China to the US being taxed.
Beijing has backed down every step of the way, and recently put tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion at five to ten percent.
China has vowed to join the US in the shootout, and the world's second-largest economy will not be pressing an A so quickly.
If they want Washington to stop doing so, they should respond to requests, but to be publicly small in front of the United States would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing takes the right decisions, US pressure in the trade war with China could be supported in the long run, as it would reduce the interconnectedness of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic bubble in both countries is ultimately far more dangerous than viewers have realized so far", said Abigail Grace, a research associate for the Asia-focused Think Tank Center of New American.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says the Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready to take in the refugees who want to return and is asking for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met to ensure that the refugees who wish to return to their country and the worst flights caused by terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and living conditions can return.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or help from the countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe finishes with Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The USA have now lost six straight times on European soil and have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had most of the tournament problems, shot his tea shot into the water in the par-3 of the 16th lap, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his runs, becoming one of only four players to ever have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament took its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with 5&4 from the European team's worst player, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best placed player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most victories of all time with 25.5 career points.
"I usually don't cry, but I can't help it today.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for taking me with him and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the cup again.
It's going to be a team, and I'm glad I could help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He is a close ally of his country colleague, John Ram, who defeated US legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game on Sunday.
"The incredible pride I feel in beating Tiger Woods, I watched him grow up", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches against France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA had trouble finding fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played all the golf tournaments at a high level.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance of his squad, "I'm proud of the boys, they fought.
There were moments in the morning when we showed our pride in Europe.
We fought.
A hat for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to get back together, I'm going to talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to put your mouth out.
We were attacked.

A red tide flow extends about 130 miles along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
Patches can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but in fewer places compared to last week.
Red Tide has also been seen in Pasco district.
Medium-scale concentrations on or off the coast of Pinellas County have been reported in the past week, deep to high concentrations off the coast of Hillsborough County, deep to high concentrations in Manatee County, deep to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, deep to medium concentrations in Charlotte County, deep or high concentrations along the coast of Lee County, and deep concentrations in Collier County.
Breathing problems are still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
