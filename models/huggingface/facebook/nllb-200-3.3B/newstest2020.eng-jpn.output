42 years, after all, since punk poet John Lydon of the Sex Pistols first noisily linked the Queen with the idea of a "fascist regime"; and although the history of postwar Europe strongly suggests that there is no inevitable connection between royalty and reactionary politics, it can be argued that the 1970s punk movement at least tried to open up a conversation about monarchy and democracy, one which the UK has since failed to pursue.

Fargo cuts BNY Mellon's Charles Wells Scharf as CEO
Fargo & Co (WFC.N) named banking veteran Charles Scharf as chief executive officer on Friday, the lender's third CEO since a wide-ranging sales scandal erupted three years ago.
Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker, who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly. Scharf will take over from interim CEO Allen Parker, who was thrust into the position in March when former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly.
Sloan had said increased pressure from politicians and regulators had become a distraction in running the scandal-plagued bank.
Scharf will take charge at a time when the bank is under a regulatory microscope and is working at rebuilding its tarned reputation following the scandal.

FARGO'S board has been shuffled many times since the scandal, with more than half of its independent directors joining the board after 2016.
Most recently, Scharf was heading Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N).

BNY Mellon                                       
The bank also said Scharf had forfeited all of his equity and incentive awards which were unvested as of Thursday.
AnalystBrianKleinhanzl saidhe wasuncertainwhatto expectfrom Scharf as Wells Fargo's CEOsincehis tenureat Bank of New YorkMellon lasted only for two years.
Scharf's first task will be appeasing regulators and making the changes necessary to remove the asset cap currently in place, Kleinhanzl said.
54-year-old Scharf started his career in 1987 at Commercial Credit Corp, a consumer finance company run by Jamie Dimon and Sandy Weill - executives who went on to lead two of America's biggest banks.
He was named Dimon's assistant six months into the job at Commercial Credit, according to an alumni magazine for the NYU stern business school.

Wells Fargo said Scharf's base salary at the bank would be $2.5 million - almost the same as Sloan's base pay in 2018.

2019 Rugby World Cup: Warren Gatland announces Wales line-up for Australia showdown
Warren Gatland has named an unchanged team for Wales' Pool D showdown against Australia, with Alun Wyn Jones set to become the country's most-capped player when he leads his side out in Tokyo.
The Wales skipper wins his 130th cap, breaking the previous record held by prop Gethin Jenkins.
                                                                                  
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
                                  
There are also further opportunities for prop Wyn Jones and flanker Aaron Wainwright after they made their Rugby World Cup debuts in the Georgia game.
                 
Sunday's clash at the Tokyo Stadium will likely decide the winner of Pool D, setting up a potential quarter-final against either France or Argentina.                                                                                                           
Should Australia claim victory - in what would make for their 14th win from the last 15 meetings between these two sides - Gatland's men could find themselves on a collision course for a last-eight encounter with England.

The North Americans were beaten 48-7 by Italy in their Pool B opener at Fukuoka Hakatanomori Stadium on Thursday and now face three-time world champions New Zealand on Oct. 2 in Oita before meeting South Africa on Oct. 8 in Kobe.
Ardron, one of the few Canadians playing in a top-tier club competition - for New Zealand club Waikato Chiefs in the international Super Rugby competition - recognized his side were unlikely to upset either of the southern hemisphere nations.
"We're at the World Cup to play against the best (and)... for this game (against Italy) we were definitely not the favorites and that showed on the scoreboard", Ardron said.
(Against New Zealand) we have to go out and put out something that we are proud of.

Babies exposed to air pollution have greater risk of death

It is not the first study to investigate the link between air pollution and infant mortality, but the study drew particular focus on different pollutants and its analysis at different points in babies' lives.

"You live where you live and you can't avoid pollution day in day out", she said, adding that it was down to policymakers to reduce pollution levels and for researchers to unpick how pollutants affect health.

Further analysis suggested that of the three pollutants, only SO2 was associated with deaths within a baby's first 28 days.

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
It looked at average pollution levels over relatively large areas while in reality levels can vary greatly over a small distance - meaning the babies' true exposure was not captured.

Toledano said it was also unclear how factors like birthweight were accounted for.
"It is showing there is some kind of additional risk from air pollution for infant death but the way that it has been set up is quite a crude analysis", said Toledano.
Dr Penny Woods, chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said action must be taken to tackle the public health crisis of air pollution - including introducing clean air zones in the most polluted cities.

Zimbabwe: Sanctions Slow Zim Progress

President Mnangagwa has said that the illegal and ruinous sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West have markedly slowed down the country's development.

President said this here during his address to the 74th Ordinary Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA 74).

President said that while Zimbabwe had registered significant progress in providing safety nets for vulnerable groups of society, more could have been achieved if it had not been for the illegal sanctions.



President Hage Geingob of Namibia called for the unequivocal lifting of sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe so that Harare could pursue its economic development agenda.

As the United Nations, let us boldly honor the principles of our Charter.

"We've had a great start to the season, but we'd still like to be better at retrieving the puck, defensively, in all three areas of the ice", he explained.
