A Republican strategy to hamper Obama's reelection
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that voter fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only found 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And along that same line, a majority of American governments enacted, beginning in 2009, new laws that made the process of registering or voting difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, during 2011 180 bills were introduced restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to present a photo ID, plus proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Before the 2006 election, no American state required voters to present a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
So the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of American citizens, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a state government agency.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often getting the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions therefore disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Moreover, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to file such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed certain laws in 2011 that abolished voter registration on the same day as the ballot in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a service to help voters who wished to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of around 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have led to a fall in the rate of new voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of the voters who cast ballots in advance were African-American, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state's voters.
In the case of Hispanics, it was exactly the same.
These represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent no more than 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have been vehemently opposed to passing laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage was partially contained.
For example, only 16 of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this respect, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: To be tested or not?
The PSA test sometimes produces false negative or even false positive results, after which it is decided to carry out unnecessary medical interventions.
It is more than enough to make men, already reluctant, doubt whether or not they should be tested.
To take the test or not?
We've asked two specialists for advice.
Studies in the United States have found a high rate of infection among the sample groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
The European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
The study, which followed up at 12 years of age, also showed that there is a 30 to 40% chance of metastasis if the screening test has not been carried out.
I recommend testing at age 50, or at age 40 if your father has had prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten life in the long term, in which case active surveillance of the disease should be preferred.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer go untreated, since the cancer is neither aggressive nor life-threatening.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend you get tested anyway.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor about whether you should get tested.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urological Society, a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing the disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate right and got enough exercise, we could prevent 30 percent of cancers.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50 percent", points out André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we estimate that about 10 percent of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It is extremely damaging to people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec", said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Here's a hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting, the risk of dying from cancer is cut in half.
Weight
Obesity and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer", they add.
The food
The agency also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large amounts, they escalate the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Carcutery products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogens.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer", they explain.
The vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one group showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another group showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of discussing your concerns and family history with your doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer".
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a great deal of commotion last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in effect, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what's more, it's the particle that the Standard Model predicted would exist: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has yet to be empirically observed.
But it's not entirely clear to physicists that it's the Higgs.
We know for sure that there is a new particle that is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely certain.
Anyway, we're assuming that it's the Higgs, because the chances of getting it wrong seem slim.
There is, in this great world, a general and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There's no way to break that rule, and don't try too hard, because you'll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the Pauli exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure at Berkeley Labs, which is, by the way, extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: mesons, which we won't talk about here, and "force particles", which are the forces that nature's great forces propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I should stress here, are not the exotic beasts we might believe.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily mundane boson - the photon, or "light particle", that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when an electrically charged particle accelerates or changes direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field in that particular environment - much like throwing a stone into a pond.
From this "disorder" comes an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, except that it's another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field, and to activate it, you have to reach extremely high energies, a little like a frozen pond where only a thick rock can slide across the surface.
So an immense particle accelerator like the one at CERN (the great hadron collider is a 27 km ring!) is needed to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick by itself to a refrigerator door.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way) don't.
What can all this research 'bring' to the table?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and allows physicists to scrutinize the differences between the observations and predictions of the MS.
Many, on the other hand, are eager to meet, for the slightest difference could open the door to a "new physics" that fills certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has huge flaws, such as not proposing any explanation for gravity (oops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (more oops!).
But we haven't found such differences at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of such research on our daily lives is difficult to predict, but we do not think we are wrong to say that it will not have any.
So, look, in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser in the laboratory had no idea what a revolution their work would bring about.
They were able to see the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962, has said, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Can you imagine?
And, in addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light-capturing device in 1969 in the course of his research in optics.
Although it was not at all his original intention, this sensor now serves as the "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC are necessarily going to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care, the best way to die is to...
In its Die with Dignity Commission, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The cancer of the prostate that was destroying him had given him a two-year break.
"I had been given five years to live, but I've been like this for seven", he relates, making a pass, lying on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this", he continues.
The disease has taken its toll on him: a tremendous weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he resignedly accepts help to eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention, bring him medicines, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating", she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that ailment.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man urinates standing up", relates Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
To return to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the person's ability to accept that regression", he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, the great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
Every patient who comes into the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Center has cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide "curative" care.
Mrs. A., 89,'s greatest fear is dying "conscious and drowned".
But the disease has made him discover his children.
"I have good children", he adds.
"I have no more desires left in this life", she says, before agreeing to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
And he expects, in the next few days, a final visit from his son who lives in Italy.
A group of volunteers offer body care and food assistance at Victor-Gadbois.
It's palliative care that's given to them when there's nothing else you can do.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec, we have one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we all know that we're going to die one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the center's doctors.
Whether it's physical comfort, emotional comfort or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, depending on the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer able to control their blood sugar.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer, who died during the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the dead man's feet.
"We help both patients and their loved ones", relates Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois Center, days go by and they're never the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man enjoying his last family gathering in the yard, well-placed between his pillows as everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, wife and two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months now, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age with cancer", worries Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadboisarrivent come from home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the end of his life, whether at home, in a hospital or in a care facility.
And several organizations, like the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Home Palliative Care Society of Grand Montreal, specialize almost exclusively in caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative shortage in Quebec's health care that makes many palliative care doctors fear the passage of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminent palliative care figures such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe has circulated to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec's health care system is not competent enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently", he relates, "I saw a patient spend 14 days in the ER in excruciating pain without any relief.
I fear that patients may want to die just because they are not receiving proper care".
And at the same time, many oncologists are stubborn with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already low when she stopped exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
"When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting", he relates.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not answering their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But palliative care is not all-powerful when it comes to pain management.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care in Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8 percent of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to put the patient to sleep until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease is going to have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The unrelieved patients all say the same thing: "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia", but "I want relief".
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP businessmen, political party fundraisers and specialists in the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know about a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are part.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers too much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's funny how the system is pulverized once we've hunted down the mainstream media", says Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by a thorough investigation into embezzlement linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the Liberal Prime Minister at the time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the Ministry of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars in contracts", containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, while hoping to "demonstrate the schemes behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government interventions, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the Marteau squad, which since 2009 has made Montreal's "sewer cartel" moderate in inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to register a series of fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a town in the suburbs.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of having pocketed repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The charges have been filed against Montreal road network engineers and Italian-born businessmen such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused a shock when explaining to the committee the mechanics of the 'system' of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito distributed money to right and left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal vice-prime minister Nathalie Normandeau.
The inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, explained it perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes from construction companies totalling 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road officials have admitted that they received money for inflating bills by between 30% and 40% as false extras.
In addition, an organizer for the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr Tremblay of having deliberately turned a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first politicians elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of the real estate boom.
70% of the campaign money was dirty money
Of the research that will eventually be carried out, she says she is pulling "a thread to understand the workings of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits".
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive".
We're cleaning up the wounds, but we'd need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a lot of vigilance to make sure the questionable practices don't happen again.
How to clean.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, says that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is particularly concerned about the role of "elected politicians who are aware of the scheme".
Estimating that 70% of the dirty money used to finance electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically says: "I've been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but that won't change the donation, he said, "as long as electoral spending isn't strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics".
He advocates a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "we cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws".
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I'm advancing day by day at his side.
The technical staff has also been very helpful.
And those elements push me every day to raise the bar of my game.
In a match, that's easier.
Things go very fast in football.
But I'm not getting hot.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They know every workout is crucial.
That's what makes a player like me want to fight and give it my all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti is a great help to me in terms of my positioning.
He's backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the man who needed the equipment?
Of course, I'm going to.
Ancelotti inspires respect from all the technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won numerous titles with the top clubs.
He's worked with great players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I was just coming off a series of injuries.
Your confidence in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first part of the season?
In League One, Lyon has taken our lead.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the last eight in style.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
Let's try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our league against Porto to get the round of the last eight.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You've got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there for the long term.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is committed to making this project a reality.
If we don't win the League One Cup, like last season, would that be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we're gonna put all our efforts into winning that championship.
Last season we didn't get very far.
In May we were disappointed, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it's going to be a good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It's normal they expect a lot from us if you think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We've totally accepted it.
After we beat 4-0 at home to Troyes, still having to face things to blame is a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We're never gonna be able to win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to get a game project going.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City, who, after two seasons, have failed to qualify for the last eight, and they have invested a lot too!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with a 15 point head start per day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
That just goes to show how exciting League One is.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better say we have a "Zlatandependence".
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and he scores a lot of goals.
He's come to prove he's the star of League One.
And he's proven in every team he's been through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What you've done is truly exceptional.
It pushes the others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating playing time.
I saw things there and I came out reinforced.
I'm playing some good games today.
It's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned the lesson from what happened in Ukraine and that is why we are behaving in an exemplary manner today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first month at the helm of the Blues?
It's getting results.
They're well placed in the World Cup qualifying group.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the Euro Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the 1-1 draw in Spain on 16 October serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Each fought for all.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a game like this in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is the opposite of the current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between parties.
Moreover, as is often the case with technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files on an equal basis.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers in the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to around $10 today (the quotes are censored on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It's not impressive when compared to the world's changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) became interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange, a central authority controls and handles the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously bookkeepers, verifiers, coin issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two electronic addresses in the form of e-mail.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is signed electronically via a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanges of bitcoins are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This involves solving a mathematical challenge thrown to the computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
It is a file-sharing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "catch" the new transaction and add a number before "crunching" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it's the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, in order to commit fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would be orphaned, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is split in two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to the hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
Life on the net has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been hacked and Bitcoin deposits have been stolen.
"The flaw used does not affect the same protocol", says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse payments of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes quite strongly in the potential of this technology in addition to the network of transactions.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which are cheaper.
The holder also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They simply need to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to overhaul hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but in 2013 there could be a change", he predicts.
The ECB also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in its report should the currency succeed.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and maimed.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of foreign armies, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was made by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban inflow into Kabul from late 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was engulfed in fire and blood because of the fighting between different factions.
His takeover of the country had been perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The leading figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, taking government land to resell as solar for refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. outsourcing contracts.
They're discredited; most of them haven't fought.
People, from what I've heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as do those who have taken advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
The young are tired of war and its ideologies.
They've lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan and appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of both boys and girls.
We must give jobs to those young people who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is hungry for mobile phones, and television and its Turkish brochures presenting the modern world have huge fans all over the country.
The army is present now.
Will the authorities who want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralisation in the image of the Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralised state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of prime minister which had existed since the 1964 constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in view of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, their country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
No industry has been restored, no reservoir has been repaired, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the West was there to take them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province's most important employers.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are heavily dependent on imports and exports, to restore normal relations.
French troops set off on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, boys' schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to accomplish the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain localities.
These efforts, which were to obtain local labor, helped contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection, and increased cropland.
What will we leave as a memento after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will help to improve the very harsh local living conditions in these valleys, which are often over 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free them from the insurrection by foreign groups, which the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small civilian aid, well controlled and directly to them.
A Constitution with Force in Egypt
He's a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever about the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he decided to play it all for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Only a week ago the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years Egypt has been using a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial messes.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium" and continues "betraying his word" and "trampling on the law".
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short time which forced the Brothers to abandon their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way of recovering popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is wreaking havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote for him, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal was voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either vote for my text or I retain full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority of whom are Islamists, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the meeting.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not enforce their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people were added as replacement members yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators are pleased, moreover, that one of the few discrepancies of the day was expressed almost at the time of the prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's clock was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all the eyeballs, is still ultimately identical to the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the norms", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it nothing more than a publicity stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to Article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy".
The fears of the liberals are further increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not scholars but university students, some of them trained in the French system", explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, as the terms used imitate religious vocabulary.
"We are referring specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent are the civil judges competent to rule above all this".
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the president of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to what they were during the previous regime.
Another point of contention: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Nor will the prosecution of civilians in military courts be banned, as human rights groups have called for.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
Furthermore, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive thing, she said, was the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
The word was not in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was scheduled to appear on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state demonstrated on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaiting the holy land, the belly button of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comforts and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptism pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the site of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Viacrucis or Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin for "Dolorous Way").
It begins at the Fortress of Anthony, the Praetorium, where the trial was held, and continues through the streets of the Old City, to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing, and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Umbilicus of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built on the site where, according to Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross for the crucifixion of Jesus was made.
In Jerusalem is also the holiest place for Jews, the Wailing Wall; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
As is the custom, people of different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then be fulfilled.
Performing a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great had built in 25 B.C. for his family.
They are found on mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there on their own, only those who are dedicated to climbing.
The rest of you can get to this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
Bus services are available from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly dwelt on the mountain's summit.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them are worth a visit, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It contains the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, or Qumran Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artifacts.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is worth a visit.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases by impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha bath museum, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the exclusive private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are strictly not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children murdered in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You walk into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is mentioned as well.
Health and safety
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of these is home to swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums, and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that they bathe in the Red Sea even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and they bathe there all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 meters below sea level.
The blue waters there are a salt marsh that easily holds even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of salt water, brine and curative mud treatments and to strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
They are preserved in the old part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
It was the famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this very place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls in the street with your "same" symbol, fortune will be in your favor.
In Jaffa you can find newlywed couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk around the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the chief city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for nightly concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
Money for this trip is not recommended to take in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shèquels (currently 1-3$,8 shèquels).
Urban transport is mainly buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
It's actually from a subway.
Traveling by any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by trans-shipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Saturdays are observed as the Sabbath.
From Friday night until Saturday sunset, markets and shops are closed and public transportation is disrupted.
But Sunday morning is the start of a new work week.
Many cafes, restaurants, and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, skimmed fish, and dishes that combine milk and meat.
There is a wide selection of dishes made from beef and lamb, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
You don't see stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that "walk about" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The purrs love crowded places and don't reject sweets.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
Plus the insurance, which comes out for $15 a day.
And the rent of a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Museum tickets cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land was visited by 118,8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, a figure 51% higher than the same rate in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
While MPs and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the mandatory exam law, scammers have already appeared in the country, trading "fake" certificates.
Each year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since 1 December, a law has come into force, according to which every migrant worker must take an exam to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, in time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the language exam, but also the Russian history and the fundamentals of legislation.
Language skills must be confirmed even for the purposes of obtaining and renewing a work permit.
The exception is for citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The law will not apply to persons who obtained their educational certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Usefulness, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be operated under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the tests in all cities, and there are now more than 160 such centres in Russia.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and by the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights activists, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this really bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, Immigration officials say, this will reduce the number of people who suffer from "labour slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Immigration Service's representation in Tajikistan.
The defence of your rights must be initiated before your departure.
Only an organised selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are with immigrants without a profession, education, those who do not know the language and do not pass medical checks.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev claims, the future immigrant will be doomed to encounter unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, will put him on a "paid trip" to a creepy, cramped shelter, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or papers, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We've had countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, deprived of their passports, not paid the promised salaries", confirms the Head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little chief!
Meanwhile, however, many citizens of Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also have difficulty writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as their own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive a normal primary education.
This is because their families have nothing even to feed the children, let alone to clothe them, shoe them and buy them school supplies.
As they reach adolescence, these kids venture into work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
However, as far as the language law is concerned, rights advocates point to an important point.
The examinations will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they don't have that status, there will be no exam and, consequently, no official job.
Meanwhile, most of the migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or no strangers allowed".
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only fifteen hundred rubles.
The Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and extortion cases are reported.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea", Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be stingy, buy yourself a painting"
On the first day of the language law's entry into force, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several "fake" language certificates have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they did not come into the hands of the new owners as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the test, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
Until now, the authorities can promise immigrant workers who failed the first test more time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: shooting during wedding celebrations in which luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a gun license from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the law on gun ownership will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the Internet, in which the authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such "senseless rigor" measures be abandoned.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov told Russia's BBC news service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms were committed, compared to 1168 crimes recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian arms sector will not be an obstacle for the criminal to go to the black market.
Now, according to him, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Interior says the situation of illegal weapons proliferation is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officials
The black market for arms is supplied through various channels.
The main channels are years, says retired colonel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts gun orders
The first, "army or military relics", i.e. weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves", says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon", those stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes weapons stolen from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were caused prematurely to cover the shortfall", says a former soldier.
According to Baranets, the weapons manufacturers also put their grain of sand.
"Private arms factories have now proliferated that are not competitive on the international market and distribute arms under the yoke to the black market, including the one in Moscow", says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own production, sometimes handmade, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons", explains the former soldier.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of illegal arms supply to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Planning in Public Management.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market arms have arrived there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons", says the report.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The clerk of one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, says that guns found by illegal excavators have not been bought for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers turn to military warehouses when they need a match.
Through some ensign, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT pistol.
They take it off the register and pass it over the fence.
"He takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two magazines", he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be complied with, they make test purchases from illegal arms dealers", the employee adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy suggested I go to the platform "Begovaya", where there would be a man who would take me to a "square" where we could negotiate.
The price of the gun, I only found out there".
Military commentator Viktor Baranets is a former Soviet Union general.
"I need a friend with connections to get a gun", says the shopkeeper. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much".
There are vendors in the markets, but there you have to go, say "from Mr Ivanovih, who asked me to tell you that a tooth has fallen out of his daughter".
I can even get a pair of steel handles through a trusted person.
He also only supplies me because he knows I won't give it to him.
Rookies look for weapons in different ways.
Former military officer Viktor Baranets was tested in the role of an illegal arms buyer in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, he says, have not changed.
They handed him a photo album where there was no "everything".
"I felt like I was in a luxury boutique", recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered cat for hare: everything there is can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, don't just buy; we go with the salesman to the woods, where we put a target.
"I get a chance to shoot, and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating", the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where people offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal appointments are required.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money", they write in the headline of the advertisement "Buy a pistol or a machine gun".
Users place their orders and ask questions there.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", he asks the user "Ivan" (spelling preserved).
"I'll buy a pistol from TT Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and catches those who want to buy firearms with their hands.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to mine coal in Siberia.
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranets
I've heard about these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are ordering.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden", reports press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Guns", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you order online, you're out of guns and you're in jail.

Makarov for 100 bucks
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "Right to Gun", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-300.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.
It's sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers go on strike in the US.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's.
In recent days, a wave of protests has erupted in the United States against low wages paid in Walmart supermarkets and restaurants run by popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For now, no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and tame itself in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by the trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases received by Walmart and fast food workers, the goal of the protest organizers is to create labor unions in these companies.
At present, this sector of the economy has been virtually unoccupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday". On that day, the U.S. began the orgy of sales that captured millions of residents, and was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and formed picket lines alongside labor unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores, whose products are aimed at low- and moderate-income earners.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners to eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why so many low-paid Walmart workers only shop at work.
The availability and variety of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to the two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklift trucks or handheld scanners.
On that "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded the increase of salaries and complained that the cost of the health insurance provided by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the typical Walmart worker, who earns $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
That's about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In one year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protest took place in only nine states and caused no losses to the corporation.
"Black Friday" lasted in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on "Black Friday".
Company representative Dan Fogelman stated in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that "fewer than five" Walmart employees left their jobs and that the protest had been nothing more than "another public relations stunt", organized by the workers' union.
"Cash out of the box!"
Protests continued this week in New York, with the targets not being Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city are not appreciated, and so there are none at the moment), but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says they sell billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, the average worker in New York City is paid $8.90 an hour.
Nobody makes less than them in this town.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that kind of money, it is something incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers would stop by McDonald's and work there, behind the counter, part-time after school, even though they were still living with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for long.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, a commentary on a Wall Street Journal forum notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
The protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cash cashiers and fast-food cooks start getting paid at least $15 an hour, or double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
US law prohibits the administration from denying them this right and punishing union activists with cleverness and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to take over the fast food sector.
One of the main problems is excessive staff turnover.
Disagreeing
Noisy protests took place that same day at other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, which was attended by several local Democratic politicians, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's says it's selling billions of servings, and then it doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work".
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said "we must support fast food workers to get the fair wages and economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves".
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not even all of them employees of the fast-food chain that employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a mass movement.
"At the moment, it's not so easy to fool the brain".
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among modern technology enthusiasts, is now normally perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it became known that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company's scientists, glasses were already a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We're dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we're also trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been caught in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look five to ten years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and no Xbox is sold today without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is in the future?
- Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change that, we're working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design.
We must free the world of computing to our own, to the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around him.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, to hell with those silly VR helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course, it can't be considered a panacea, it's still pending to resolve the privacy issue, since we don't always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of computer interaction are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the device's camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movement of bones and muscles.
It's very big for now, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can to you?
You'll talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we're going to have to work primarily on designing new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, because they provide good resolution at depth, which is very important.
- Speaking of your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the question is not megapixels, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this last point of view, all the current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to the algorithm designers.
So we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on the Z axis.
It's also about speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory, made a contact sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
I would find it very useful for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but one that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And isn't it necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible rangefinder.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or, on the contrary, increase it and increase the required number of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As I recall, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not introduced its glasses to the public.
Do you not agree that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding a smartphone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could go from glasses to a smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that's their strength (private things only you can see), but also their weakness: Augmented reality based on glasses won't allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from the movie "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
My hands feel nothing!
What responses does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth might as well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
It records the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really geared to give tangibleness to these "images in the air", for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed at a specific point where the finger is, gives a feeling similar to what you feel if someone is blowing on your fingertips, but that feeling is still very faint.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this too a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think he feels what he seems to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endlessly.
Right now, fooling the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes working with virtual reality so appealing to researchers, that a lot of things are in a state of complete conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of the art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing about them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers from St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
Moreover, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens inhabitants' smiles and lifts everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organ and became the organ builder of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to play such a difficult role, by his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I'm a fashion designer and I'm dedicated to looks and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, anything that is not a little gray elicits aggression and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my path.
So the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with later ones exhibiting in Gaza and Nevsky, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all kinds, but not for the lyrics.
It was important to me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were to gather.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought "Van Gogh's Ear" to the project.
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under a phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the now-fashioned composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was a host of many shows before Hali-galivskih's time.
We gave them Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of their great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Griboyedov Club", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and regular customers went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the poll was done in the press, the prize was "People of Our City".
In the "Artist of the Year" nomination, I was chosen, so my graduation ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes truth, honesty and the culture of the last century.
In our time it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate.
- There's something about your work that's recognizable.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the current and the occurrence.
I'm doing a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now it's painful and scary.
But in clowns everything gets messed up and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have the grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a mandatory, totalitarian change of clothes.
Now they follow you by your clothes, oriented to the outside, but not to the inside of the person.
And, maybe that person is not owed a handshake, but spit in the face.
And the deception will be removed when you change your clothes.
We saw you recently in the role of urban planner.
Who better to be than me?
- Well, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have tact.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people used to pack in packs, bohemians wanted one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone's split into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to hear Stas Mikhailov they come by the thousands!
- You're going to see the abandoned, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And 300 people go to a cultural event, 10,000 never come, and as a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin what you've achieved.
When I was young, I made such pictures that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which is what people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse the concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money just to paint pictures.
I'm in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what is missing from St. Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: cultural official.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones, things were different, kings may not have understood culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could well be experts, but they're closed, because you need experts at a higher level to properly evaluate these people and open the way for them.
Now the subjective personal taste is thriving.
Same thing Erarta, but the difference is they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural land and we have more writers than readers now, this is wrong.
In Europe, there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid crash.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question is: How do we continue the species in weightless conditions or on the same spare planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are true planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars", says the chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
The problems of reproduction in space with flora began to be addressed.
Experiments with plants have been carried out for half a century.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from the varieties on land.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops under weightless conditions.
The result is a normal chick.
But then the trouble starts.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks flipped around at random.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks to be born, but then we stopped because it was impossible to work there with them", comments Vladimir Sychev on the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the Bion biosatellite only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out", comments Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot fulfill their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens have abstract reasoning and are able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, this question has not been answered", says aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after the space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice orbited and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We are few, few are the astronauts who after long flights have done well, and a healthy generation is growing up.
"And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights", sums up cosmonaut pilot, Soviet Union hero, Russian hero Valery Polyakov.
But humanity must look for some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolab of the Cosmonaut Training Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for flight.
Under conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their work skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable, yet hostile environment, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The little amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is in the amniotic fluid for about nine months, since it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget", says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming instructor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravitation is necessary, the force of gravity.
In weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepate very quickly, the ability of the fetus to expel is reduced.
Well, we've omitted that, relying on the action of birth control pills.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
"And then what?" Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to dress in a special training suit, like adults.
You'll simply deprive him of what's vital to him.
"And this experiment we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled, totally unadapted person", predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, in time this will become a reality, when human beings in their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
NKÚ chief: Inspection of the "švarc" system has not found the guilty politician
The Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation in the field of public procurement, although its implementation is lax.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "This is what we lack, in my opinion", describes the current situation.
The joint inspections by the Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not harass businessmen with inspectors.
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor to demand obligations", Kala says.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is it exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started to do about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, followed by national legislation and then by practice itself.
We have combined everything and, although the control is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to introduce ever stricter rules, but that the focus should be on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring?
It is precisely such a common control that could help to reduce the effort we put into making laws, reducing and improving the limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting a suitable thing at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But the fact that we are reducing the limit on the allocation of funds does not mean that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKU or is it organized differently?
As far as the offices, such as the NKU, are concerned, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but as Germany has a federal organization, the Court of Auditors is even at this level.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, are checked by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for the local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not possible to say exactly where it is better.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
That's certainly not the case, but, again, I don't like to make these kinds of comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries which we take as a model have to face a large number of problems.
If it weren't, it wouldn't be any benefit to you to collaborate with our office, would it?
As regards the legislation in our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
The Commission has not yet taken a decision on the matter.
Since we are carrying out ex post controls, there is a certain delay to be expected.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the future of the European Union, including the setting up of a European network of national experts to monitor the implementation of the European Union's policies and the development of the European Union's policies.
Do you think that the passage of this law is beneficial or that it is rather a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it will be.
The problem that can arise is that the rules "get tougher" and it becomes impossible to enforce them.
Under the previous rules, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any law not respected in the field of public procurement was a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this kind will only create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this road leads.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDGs would not bother employers with so-called Švarc system controls, in reference to the fact that it is autonomous only on paper.
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the Office from acting which has the obligation to carry out such controls and to enforce obligations.
You can say, "We changed the law and we allowed it", but you can't say we'll just pretend like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how it should be done formally.
But on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best bid is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct.
Roads are icy, but mostly passable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads are covered with ice and snow.
Although most roads are walkable, some require extreme caution.
Region of Karlovy Vary
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but there were ice and snow.
The temperature will drop to between five and ten degrees below zero, and the thermometers will rise slightly during the day.
Snow has stopped in the region and in the lowlands the snow cover is thin.
On the other hand, on the slopes of the Metallic Mountains, snow reaches nearly 12 inches [30 cm].
In some places visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 motorway and the first-class road in the region are now free of restrictions.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges where the surface may be icy and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, some of them still contain traces of ice and snow.
The Commission is also aware of the need to improve road safety, particularly in higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the roads, reports the Directorate of Roads and Highways on its pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frost can occur in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ústí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a thick snow cover at the highest parts of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be clear and partially cloudy today, with no rainfall.
Temperatures will generally range from minus three to one degree positive, with a weak wind.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the Pilsen region are open this morning, but caution must be exercised and the weather adjustments made.
In the early hours of the morning, it will be freezing, with temperatures ranging from three to nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads may also be covered in ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is according to information from the regional road operations control centre.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometre 80 and 131.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen-Tachov road bordering Germany there may be sections with ice sheets.
The second and third category roads are wet, so in this case, there is also a warning of sections with ice sheets.
Drivers should be more careful, especially on the less-traveled roads in the Šumava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers heading to the higher areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially cleared snow.
After the chemical treatment, snow still remained in the Červenohorské port and on the track towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators cleared the snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the Šumper road, according to the road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are free of restrictions.
"In the higher parts of the Šumper road, there are traces of snow.
Drivers in the Červenohorské port will encounter half-dumped snow heading towards Jeseník", an operator from the Šumper road administration confirmed today to ČTK.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks in the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the tracks are free of restrictions, on the Šternberská road drivers should drive with caution on forested sections, where the tracks remain wet.
Region of Ústí nad Labem and region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on several sections in the early hours of the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frozen, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the Ústí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures remain below zero even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the roadway.
No service complications have been reported so far.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night, with rain and melting snow expected during the day and clear skies and ice at night.
Unfavourable conditions have been reported from the general roads on the road I/13, on the border between Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Knínice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the track with the weight of the snow.
Šimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy in our concerts
They say the world is going to end in less than a month, what do you think?
It's just one of many other alarmist news stories we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap band likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to postpone or avoid the end of the world.
And in December, you're organizing a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain that to our readers?
It's a state benefit we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar stated for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December at 9 p.m., we will be holding three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the end of the Mayan calendar on the Pacific island of Kiribati, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
It was my idea at first, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, T-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anti-end of the world anthem, titled "End of the World, Cancelled".
It's currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at charity concerts?
Of course I do, and it'll just be the last one, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time at all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked together simultaneously through a special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák wrote the lyrics for this song and plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We also work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charity events and concerts...
We are doing our best to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised from the anti-doomsday concerts be used for?
A equipment for the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we are carrying out in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkův ústav.
Students at Jedličkův ústav school are regularly visited by teachers, with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have the financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedličkův ústav, there will be a separate building to which we will move with this project.
Each concert features several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, there will be performances by Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
For more information, please see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "spectacular action" planned in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I, personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, you have so far acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, we have done well so far, and ČSA and British Airways have been perfectly prepared, which is something that surprises me.
Even in Moscow, where we have just returned, everything went smoothly.
Travel abroad allows you to compare different attitudes in society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that in the East there is still a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, so it is still not common for a person to travel alone in the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, is not.
Fortunately, a civil association has been set up to work on the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we follow the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects where we're lagging behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with severe disabilities to move around on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want...
But it is not very common for large numbers of people with disabilities to participate actively in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a step further!
A society that respects or has no barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to change everything for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The Tap Tap are very popular now, but if we look back a few years, what made you start the band in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkův ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among other things, the saxophone, I founded an amateur band with a coworker.
And over time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, it got a little out of hand. (Laughter)
However, popularity didn't come until these last few years, am I wrong?
It was a great help to connect with famous singers and to work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that we don't see, is as if it doesn't exist.
Thanks to the European Union's aid, we can afford quality teachers, equipment, etc.
You were planning on going this far with The Tap Tap?
I saw the potential from the beginning, that you could do something differently.
The show business is full of things that look alike.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is received with caution and takes a long time to be accepted.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned, suffering beings that we should have compassion for.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop themselves, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something works out for people with disabilities, then it's not just a breakthrough for them, it's a breakthrough for society as a whole.
Did it help that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand a certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and their heads in the clouds and when they find out they have to go to two days of rehearsal, go to the prep test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and achieve something.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Just one, the Lady Angelovich.
We're an open group, people come and go, you can't avoid it.
Whoever has the will and the will will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, at Fléda in Brno and at Plynojem in Ostrava and will feature 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconference to sing together the song by the group The Tap Tap "End of the World, Cancelled".
The aim of the concert is to raise the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free education centre in Jedličkův ústav in Prague, which will cost 25 million Czech crowns.
The concert ticket costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entry in the early sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At last week's European Space Agency Ministers' Meeting, Poland was accepted as ESA's twelfth member, the second ESA member country from the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008.
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in commissioning projects for the agency in the following years.
However, Poland's path into the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already involved in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the lecture by A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, where, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The young engineer's ideas (born 1905) left the attendees indifferent and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned earlier, later became a great promoter of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when one of the craters on the moon's far side was named after him.
Already in 1925 a dredge was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who the author of the proposal was and the details of the project are not known.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
Information about this dressing is limited to that collected in the press of the time.
From 1933 the Polish artillery began to work on missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the material preserved, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki, was published.
Both projects were intended for the military use of the missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects on missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the outbreak of war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Astronaut Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of the magazine Problemy, the society is referred to for the first time with four very extensive articles devoted to astronomy.
One of them, by Prof. M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society devoted to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched, and it was obvious that space research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on 10 October 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the two-stage RM-2 rockets began air tests in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission was to control the high wind.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968 the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aero Institute, with the first aerial tests beginning in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the research of space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
The liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
This means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) creates economic tensions.
This concept is to be understood as the situation in which the manufacturer, by importing cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to this end 'causes a fall' in the price of the competitor in order to take over the majority of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, to move production abroad, buy cheaper there or disappear. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labour, compared to other economies, is higher.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and is therefore not responsible for the unemployment generated by this phenomenon, the social expenditure of the state necessarily grows.
This situation is conducive to the total disinterest of the entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their quest for profit.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations in certain economies where the governments of those countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own people without taking into account social decline.
This is particularly evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially as regards wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by the system of economic obligation in the case of longterm unemployment; on the other, by the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with the widening gap between rich and poor.
For a number of years now, food delivery points have been in operation in Germany for poor people who cannot support themselves by their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of help is already approaching one million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a case occurs quite frequently: people are employed at such a low wage that the state has to pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary for survival.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German Federal Parliament.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same situation: people, pressured by an abyss of social decline, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live on a miserable wage on the fringes of society, hoping that private investment capital will one day arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty is either passing from one country to another or never arriving, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny fraction of a European wage.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media say to the full that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that managing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital is defending with its fingernails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering with control.
The question then arises whether private capital does not influence the political process and, therefore, the whole state with its selfishness.
In this case the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in every state.
The result is a desperate situation which manifests itself in the area of corruption, mutual favors, legislation which is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany the situation is as follows: the state ministries, lacking financial resources, entrust the drafting of draft laws to private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus all power does not emanate from the people, as is proclaimed in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation like that described by Appiános in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Time of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and the administrations were occupying themselves by force".
In exchange for bribes, illegitimate favors and help to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unimpeded and people went to the polls with the vote pre-palabra"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to be seriously talked about that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appiános thought of Pompeii, Caesar rose to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today's society is based on disregardful preferences for individual benefit without regard for common interests.
Private capital is not, in essence, capable of understanding and claiming the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be found in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
In view of the present situation, the disappearance of these systems in favour of a liberal democracy can be regarded as a definite pause in waiting for the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite is completely ignorant of the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and more recent history.
Suspension of the law on public procurement is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the Czech government will be forced to continue to look for other ways of reducing the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution is concrete socio-political reforms, which reinforce both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and which weaken the position of private capital as a monopoly in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my children didn't want wars, there would be none". Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on her deathbed in 1849.
After the recent wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there have been, as always, mixed reactions.
One, on the side of Israel, argues for the right of self-defense and labels the Palestinians as terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the state of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and labels Israel a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is responsible for the periodic killings and who is the victim, after all, the citizens of today's Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live through the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who is profiting from the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In each age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always the ones who directed their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions toward a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age where the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that it implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically wealthy families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don't know, but I don't rule it out): the Rothschilds.
You don't write much around them.
Of course I did.
In the 1990s, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with serious criminal acts, and power and wealth, or both, were behind them, which for them was always a strengthening factor.
They have major holdings in almost all the world's central banks and in those countries where they are not represented, war has been declared or is being prepared: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after Gaddafi was overthrown there were only four, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who's tried to oppose this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild central bank Bank of America, began during the Civil War to print money and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK started printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for having triggered the Great Depression of 1929.
Their eagerness for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the 33rd degree Mason Albert Pike.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially that of Great Britain, and the third was aimed at reducing the population of the earth to between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves would be enough for their welfare and luxury and they would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method by which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operate follows the dynamics of triggering a crisis and then offering a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
The Commission has not yet decided on the budget, but it has decided to make a proposal for a regulation on the budget for the financial year 2000.
So, after the successful assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Francis Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after World War I broke out as a result, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the onset of the Bolshevik revolution.
World War I ended suddenly and unjustifiably from a military and economic point of view, with Germany's capitulation (wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In the field of World War II, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, covertly, a conflict situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Subsequently, they had to serve the Germans the Führer's solution, which was strong enough and simple enough and pointed out the culprits, and then build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that should represent and represented so well the function of the fifth column, that it lit the flame and provoked the outbreak of the war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed for the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population there.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope that the international bankers had tied him to at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, the proclamation of the state of Israel created the focus for a third war.
If the international bankers were to succeed in starting it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a victim on the front lines of combat, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
The European Union is a great example of the need to ensure that the European Union is not only a European Union, but also a European Union, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, a European Union of nations, and a European Union of nations.
Who is to blame and who is to be blamed for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless spiral of violence, if at the beginning of it all was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, the international bankers only put forward their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel, B. Netanyahu, is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), it would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the Strait of Hormuz, through which passes 20% of all the world's oil (the shipping corridor is only two miles wide), it would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are David Rockefeller's words now being expressed in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order".
The new world order in their imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world where every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
"And it makes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that they may neither buy nor sell, but have the name of the beast or the number of his name.
You need to understand this: whoever has two fingers in front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six".
If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979 a group of Islamist student demonstrators occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohamed Réza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the United States, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
The situation did not offer any positive prospects for the American administration: it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, since if it did so it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of theocratic rule, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later intensified by the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the United States, his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The defeat in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter to Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck thematizes an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before the embassy was occupied, six employees of the building escaped.
After a difficult journey, they ended up at the Canadian embassy residence.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which a covert story helped an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film crew who examined the location in the country for the filming of a super science fiction production.
Combination of genders
The plan drawn up by the "exfiltration" expert Toni Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
To make the lie look true, the film project was written about in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictitious production company even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the series Ocean's Eleven).
The film combines moods, on the one hand, we find well-documented footage of Tehran, on the other hand, the credits show iconic photographs of the time of the events, which were captured in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a little lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then, scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions: men in suits analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the office hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the object of ridicule, has become a respectable director and his acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adio, small, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed old-timey film directors above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran is "rolling" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of true events.The introductory sequence of the takeover of the embassy is impressive for its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the bewilderment and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story doesn't offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he does it pretty well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here everything doesn't go so elegantly (the scene where the crisis lurks at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the unbridled search for its trail becomes crazy).
Argo's weakness is the out-of-control that comes from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, far from it, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic traction, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its making and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But to collapse, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a true story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which annually presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the most absurd regulation or ideas in the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event that the EU is planning to approve a 40% quota of women in management positions in large European companies", explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the organiser of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from better rates on life insurance because they objectively represented less risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year".
The election will take place at the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations are, for example, the mandatory addition of bio-components to fuel, which results in environmental damage; another prohibition is the use of lifetime mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance; or the guideline shades the size of chicken cages, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of eggs this year.
Criticism has been leveled at the de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter cream' or the withdrawal of the traditional light bulb from shops.
A good banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The EU apparatus often makes such decisions under pressure from one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The lobbying interests were behind the request, for example, that the highest quality bananas in the EU should be at least 14 centimetres long and not be allowed to have "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that it was only trying to harmonize national rules which had not been harmonised to date, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules referring to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the grounds that the existing directive entails food waste.
The candidate to win the poll could be last year's EU prescription that inflatable balloons sold in the EU must be warned that children under 8 are not allowed to inflate them without adult supervision.
The United States was referring here to an American study which found that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the leading cause of death by asphyxiation in children.
A similar restriction applies to the use of eyeglasses by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the situation in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which is a matter of concern to the Greek authorities, and which is based on the principle that the European Union should not be a party to the conflict.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, named in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the EU prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume set for canned mushrooms, which threatened it with a substantial fine.
The survey organizers were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the subsidy application.
This kind of ideas did not come from Brussels but from Prague.
"We are at a disadvantage because we have no sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation", declared then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that our country produced a lot of cereals and that, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from sea ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission was finally willing to help the Czech Republic by holding a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries with no access to the sea.
The grant was proposed to municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), specifically for the preparation of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
Member State guidelines are often the target of criticism, but the EU's efforts in regulating and, moreover, in developing and operating more effectively across the Union are, according to several experts, worthy of our recognition.
The most serious problem, according to experts, is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects which have nothing to do with deepening European integration but which the Member States have obtained in budget negotiations.
The Czech Republic, like other countries of the European Union, is also involved in the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of its traditional products, although our country has not always been victorious in these battles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with the Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the origin of the Olomouc rum, but had to change the name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it became called "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugarcane distillation may be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
The official list of protected designations of origin of the EU already includes, together with the internationally known feta and gorgonzola cheeses, the marzipan of the German city of Lübeck and the ham of Parma, for example, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary, the carpa of Pohořelice and Třeboň and even the hops of Žatec.
As EU protected brands, they can be proud of the gingerbread of Pardubice and the barquillos of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was fine in our country, then I wouldn't be running.
But I can no longer bear to see how much has been stolen in the last 20 years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and the retirement age are raised.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don't like, I try to find a solution to change it.
And since I'm 40 years old and running as an independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run for senator or president.
The Senate has already reached it, but shortly afterwards it has set out on its way to the presidency.
Isn't he turning his back on those people who voted for him?
I always said my candidacy for president depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That's why I need the most influence possible and the strongest mandate possible.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in bars or in front of the TV, but we trample on anyone who wants to initiate change.
Add to this the media, which discredits you and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
They say I've bribed journalists or been an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
He's running for president with financial theses and criminal liabilities of politicians and declaration of property over twenty million.
That's why the law must change.
As president, you don't have this power and only the senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I was part of a lobbying group to have the job of guide recognised as self-employment, and we got it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects the citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to win the support of all the parliamentary groups.
Without framing or party dogma, I have the ability to pick something from each party that's best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself more of a right-wing or left-wing man?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we get on.
I don't care if someone is right or left, I want to bring people together.
I am always openly in favour of any good solution, whether it comes from the KSČM or the SDGs, and I am equally opposed to bad ideas.
It's a joke when people say you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When you create a business plan for your company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you try to get close to them.
There are those who will call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
But without parliamentary support, he's left with nothing but slogans.
And with that, he can't survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I don't have any other choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to get them on my side to get it done.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which I would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there's a strong character that points out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, which has been a public pressure achievement.
At the same time I assert that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to seek allies.
I've just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support for my program as possible.
I'm trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn't work out, in six years I'll quit and go back to the private sector.
Sounds a little like Okamura's going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I don't do anything with a person, so I've been visiting a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to run for the senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had too much work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I came forward on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I'm on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did, voted for the establishment representatives.
There are two of us in the senate from the independent sector.
The people elected the senate, so it's going to be difficult to make changes.
I will, however, defend my own ideas, such as direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the impeccable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have money.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about property deeds, how is yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, an apartment valued at 10 million, another apartment valued at 8 million, a collection of artworks valued at 10 million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and I have a couple of million in the account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my childhood dream, and I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women, and at the same time, fought against evil and injustice.
You drive an Aston Martin, your property is worth $60 million and you don't have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already put 2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that there's not much interest in my show.
And I don't have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The campaign expenses essentially cover what I'm getting as a senator's salary.
But I could not live on it. For example, I could not pay for my son's English school, which costs 30,000 crowns a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn't run.
So you're going to keep your business going so you can live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this business?
This has nothing to do with a raise.
As I promised, I've partly stopped my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will be my replacement in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I need to make a living, too.
How much do you usually make a month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I keep earning.
If I was president, then I'd quit the business.

The architectural studio MVRDV shows that real adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "mountain of books" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there's finally something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, notes: "Also, the building is beautiful".
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
We all have the Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody just goes into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town just outside Rotterdam that is hardly worth a quick visit, has the dubious honor of having risen to a record of oblivion.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this shameful situation, some years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture by copying the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the policy makers decided that there was only one way to improve statistics: a library had to be built!
Winy Maas, of the Dutch architecture firm MVRDV, a master of the art of bar diagrams and responsible for buildings that are fun and cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and attended the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked around in perplexity and shrugged their shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size into a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here is my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, the so-called `Boekenberg'.
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain rises in the planned place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of apartment and townhouses.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
Thus, the little town lacking in history, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly city hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But most importantly, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it's a paradise of books under a cheese-pot.
True, there is an elevator that takes us right to the center of this mountain range, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, preferring to blend in with its topography at every step of their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the recessed brick floor and elegant lanterns unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up, you can see the park benches, the dogs, and the boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"The bookshelves are usually arranged along the facade and in the middle there is a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
What we've done is we've turned the classical spatial configuration upside down and moved the reading zone from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain is well-utilized: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention is made of the black shelves which assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and rail at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the most seasoned architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear of this unfamiliar material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the town of Spijkenisse.
And so one day, on a Frisian farm, we stumbled upon the right by-product from farming.
For many years, greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands have used a plastic fabric of a few millimetres thick as a base for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to four centimeters thick plates.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous, tough material that smells like a mixture of a new car and a sneaker.
After 105 steps, you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain, the reward awaits us: from the cafeteria, not only do we have a fantastic view of the city, but we can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining the right humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology", says Trouborst.
The heating and cooling needed is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun shines for only a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located transversely to the glass facade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has been there, too.
Also, the professor of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls the "Boekenberg" the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
The aim is to fill the gaps in a library which does not yet have its complete archive, which currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
"There is nothing worse than a half-empty library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows your book is part of the library.
Even if it's only there to adorn.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a great success in the main discipline, which in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The town of Spijkenisse has written a piece of literary history.
No matter how young and uneducated he may be.
Finally a starting point for forming your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany abstained on the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, this puts Berlin in a rather acute diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories observer status at the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that binds the country to Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to show its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from the issue of establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear stand when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, that's right.
This is because at the moment it is reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already started the road to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Britain.
What does a 'normal' foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy which, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is strongly motivated by economic policy, that is to say, by exports and by its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers and Germany must therefore protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken on the Middle East conflict and the vote at the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn't give it that much importance since it's not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a tremendous degree of understanding.
I do not think that we have had a breakthrough as drastic as in Libya.
Perhaps Germany has earned some respect for itself.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the United States has been clear in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of American domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation that is being lived here, it is obvious that the government cannot defend that position in public.
I think that the real disparity of opinion is not really as large as it is supposed to be.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policies he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States with the position of its main partners in the EU?
I think that's precisely what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
They therefore have no possibility of being part of a higher entity, but must drive things from their own position.
That is precisely what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, whether simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a very funny subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player?
Or is it still difficult for you to accept such leadership?
Germany has not yet got used to it, it is always a bit uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, it is still finding it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and it is that nobody wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
You have to show a receptive attitude to different neighbors and opinions and that's not easy.
The US influence in European politics is declining, but the EU is not filling that void at the moment, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's disagreeable or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, that's life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but which has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it is protected as long as the true names do not sue.
And even then it's not clear that they're going to be justified.
"Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China", notes Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing, a firm that specializes in rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as happened with the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet where he keeps seats from the Beijing trademark office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name also used by the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large multi-storey warehouses exclusively dedicated to the sale of counterfeits.
However, the Pattloch cases are of a different nature: on behalf of his clients, he is fighting the fact that the trademark office is officially granting Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or the accompanying mark.
The word originates from the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities feel no guilt
"It's harmful to business, we have to fight it", Pattloch demands.
"The brand is flooding, the monopoly position is disappearing and the damage to the image is enormous".
The financial losses and legal costs of the sectors concerned are in the millions, especially in the case of luxury flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult and expensive to obtain the annulment of registration of dubious legality in the register of trademarks.
The proceedings can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch mentions cases where the court dismissed a lawsuit because so much time had passed that the name being sued had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged the plagiarist's brand in China", says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases involve graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company which has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
So today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo's buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that was very reminiscent of BMW; the matter was settled in the courts and Geely had to modify it.
Clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo depicted a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities feel no guilt.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to shortages of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the work emergency situation returned to normal".
The number of unprocessed complaint procedures has thus been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 complaints are still pending.
Fighting this costs a lot of money.
As is often the case in China, the figures are staggering.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and would mean that China leads the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the trademark office.
It seems that this is also the case with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, it is estimated that 1,800 million yuan were received in rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg demonstrates.
For over seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese copycat.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
The imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected", says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO also dismissed the appeal of the Municipality.
In the two subsequent instances Freudenberg was proved right, but the opposing side continues to fight today.
You have to be very careful.
Now the case has reached the doors of the Superior Court of Justice, where it is still pending resolution.
Wentzler is confident that the matter can be resolved favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time".
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business archive has had to review records up to 100 years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "six-figure sum in euros" with the aim of reaching an amicable agreement, but he was unsuccessful.
"This shows how much we care", Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten to affect even Europe,
In particular, if the imitators secure rights over unprotected trade marks there.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register the name Freudenberg in Germany for shoes and leather products.
The group has long since left this commercial sphere, but has managed to prevent registration.
"You have to be very careful", Wentzler says.
Both he and Attorney Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely cautious when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the matter may prove to be much more expensive than a mere registration.
In fact, in the event that Freudenberg lost the last round of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing side licensing fees in his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or the segment in question would kick us out of the market.
World AIDS day: dance, sing, help
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of overcoming much more than 8,733 kilometers of distance.
First, it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, high heels and moccasins search for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the singers' voices (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) begin to slowly rise, swirling, interrupting and following one another.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his energetic and soft gestures.
It's Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, from the human geneticist to the householder, are also here, ranging in age from 23 to 69.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS program, there are some 34 million people worldwide infected with the HIV virus.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
Voices for Africa has found godparents in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "story-teller" or "pan-maker".
No one in this room can speak this Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes transports them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large number of them children.
More than 300 are now without parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what is affecting Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to Unicef.
Circumcision, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of infection, is not well received by the population.
More than 40 percent of the people of Swaziland are carriers of the immune-deficiency virus, and dying at just over 30 has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this remote population, but what they saw most were many children on the streets who lacked not only their parents' protection, but the main things: food, clothing and education.
Without a school diploma, the chances in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since taken care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the STDs of bacterial origin are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Snakes and scabies are among the parasitic STDs.
What are the main groups of people affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany are caused by sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papillomavirus is also added to the most common diseases among young people.
How have the numbers of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to compulsory reporting.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has maintained a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause genital ulcers, urinary discomfort, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go undetected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change sexual partners.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any later consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees the choir charges for their performances throughout Germany, they raise quite a bit of money.
"In all, we have already sent some EUR 200,000 to Esitjeni", proudly notes Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini itself a confident woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
She makes sure that the orphans find a good place to live, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as elderly women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them take care of up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof over their heads and make sure that the children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook for over 200 hungry children every day, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and, in collaboration with the US health organisation PSI, has managed to get many of the villagers tested for HIV.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is so widespread throughout the country, it is not often discussed openly.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
Strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This unofficially accepted way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporary workers who travel the country from one end to the other and who take you wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "free condoms are available on every corner, but they are hardly used.
It's a different culture, they only accept skin-to-skin contact here".
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost tip of the African continent still remember from apartheid times.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language; such recognition not only brings with it a great atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to pull a few tears from some angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population is hardly ever found on maps, it is well-known in the Ezulweni River valley.
"Come to Esitjeni, there the light shines", the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal halls of Bergheimer Street filled with singers marking the way, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA has discovered ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the American space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Although it is the planet closest to the sun, it also has ice water, as three studies published Thursday in the journal Science show.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that in the permanently shadowed part of the planet an ice sheet has formed.
It appears to be at least 12 inches [30 cm] and probably as much as 65 feet [20 m] thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says chief researcher Sean Solomon of the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to shed light on how water and other components of life have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes, and small robots like the Phoenix are exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images back to Earth - little windows into the vastness of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006, Ceres is not a "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of endless generations of stars: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, though the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantically called W5 by scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This twisted image of an extinct star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring is composed of the material the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Triphid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are forming from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known as "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope, you can appreciate colors better.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This budding star was captured in all its glory for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably the remains of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images ever taken by the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy.
Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifida Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the fiery heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are hurling toward each other and colliding irreparably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we might find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a time as a model for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest young star cluster in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone is constantly producing new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continually emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when the universe was mostly made up of hydrogen.
Our window on the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and the images they offer are ever more profound.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope is being erected.
This allows the cosmos to be observed through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Yet, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The downside of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
With the help of the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers can search the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) anyone with a computer can help, providing processing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that lives up to its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT).
Its primary mirror will span 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflecting elements.
It is not expected to be possible to take images until 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new telescope of enormous proportions and a mirror diameter of thirty meters is planned to be built on Mauna Kea.
This is a picture of what it would look like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes to us from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images from distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers assume that there is ice at Mercury's south pole as well.
However, there is no reliable evidence, since the Messenger probe orbits the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe (2004), the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain that this is the case.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus is moving along with a great rustle along the winding road that passes beside wooded hills, flowing rivers, and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, you might even think you're in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan, just a few kilometres from the border with Iran.
Here live the "talyshi", a people about whom little is known, except that they are fluent in Persian and Azerbaijani and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive a Soviet-era architecture that doesn't seem to fit in so nicely with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 200 miles [323 km] between the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The astonishing wealth the country enjoys from the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have passed the age of 100 years.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136
However, the undisputed star of the museum is the sheep herder Şirali Müslümov, who seems to have lived to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate to prove this.
And if we consider that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
"She was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
So Şirali Müslümov has been wrong at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this Central Asian.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very old people", says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men".
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when no civil registration exists either.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a Biblical age.
There are now 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the special genes of the talyshis.
The museum director, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes that the cause lies in the food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that the calorie-rich diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom also drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
Or is it the natural way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97, he's relatively young for what's stretched out at these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge tin of butter.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
Two little children also jump from side to side.
In the kitchen, they prepare tea for the guests, a tea served in typical, bulbous-shaped cups.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief she hides two long braids of dark blond hair which her son proudly discovers us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, so it's never fallen out and it's kept its color.
"I have never used a shampoo either", says Mirzayeva.
The pension is enough to live on
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm - tomatoes, potatoes, and peas.
I've never been to a supermarket in my whole life.
So you tell us about your husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything came back to normal when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird coming from an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the father figure of the nation, who rules his country as a dictator, knows no bounds.
He remained in power until 2003, when he handed over the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly people in Azerbaijan don't know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well considering the situation here.
And maybe the blond son of Mirzayeva is right: "In our culture the elderly are highly respected".
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care, and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to keep him alive for many years...
The Constitution does not include the phrase "Human Rights".
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Riverside demonstrations in Cairo highlight the tremendous division the country is in.
The future constitution, based on Sharia law, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in pathetic.
"We must get through the transition.
And that is my responsibility, before the people and before God", he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially to Coptic Christians, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and secularists.
All of them, so far hopelessly mired in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologetically, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his own "to save the revolution".
Yet, neither the Egyptians nor the world at large know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
You mean to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, which were forced into being by a constituent assembly of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also says that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
What, though, does that mean by "principles"?
This was and is open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the legal room for manoeuvre it carries, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a newly added article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is obligatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power in all Sunni Islam.
It does not have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which - in fact - would result in the incapacity of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state is to protect "the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is a formulation so vague in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the content of cinema and literature.
Clearly, this is nothing more than censorship.
It is true that no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacy.
However, it is not clear what an offence is and how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording that prohibits "offending people".
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Morsi for his signature and which, according to his words, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks now, the opposition has been closing ranks in the face of the superiority of the Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in Cario and vowed to bring the Act to a halt before it could come into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", says Hamdin Sabbahi, who is third in the presidential list.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the draft constitution should be "in the garbage bin of history".
Through Twitter he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy".
"When he calls the referendum we will go to his palace and overthrow him", says opposition Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for", opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
For their part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many women covered with veils and Salafists' supporters took part in the protest, shouting: "The people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Morsi "clean up the country", while proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for sovereignty in the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Morsi's supporters did not want to risk such a thing happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and those in favor of it would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now it would have been time to let the people decide at the polls which direction the country should take.
In this respect, it seems that the Islamist draft has a guaranteed majority.
"The term 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process which should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, condemned, and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution", he laments in an interview with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three branches of the state made this lawyer resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it", laments Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which is watching the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could backfire on you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control".
Norwegian rakfisk - the world's most foul-smelling fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the country's success has something to do with its greed for a highly smelly fish?
Take a series of overly cured cheeses.
They're in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The scenery is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how foul-smelling you prefer it to be.
As it gets darker and colder, Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most captivating delicacy, so to speak.
"You eat raw and then drink a glass of aquavit from a drink", says Havard Halvarsen, the city's firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is kept in small cubes and drinking from one sip significant amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk", says Havard.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near your nose, that's not bad; it's not much different from a portion of sushi that you've driven a few miles on a bus.
Rakfisk is a product of a very different time, when Norway was in poverty and when, before refrigeration, fish was kept in water and salt in airtight barrels during the autumn.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is well fermented, it is taken out and, evidently with the senses inactive because of alcohol, eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not too long ago much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered an important, essential, though rather foul-smelling, part of Norway's past.
It is among the most expensive dishes that can be bought.
But in fact, everything is expensive. A beer can or a sandwich costs you a whopping 10 euros ($14) each.
Norway is not usually on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as "the July 22 incident".
The Norwegians find it very hard to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own would be capable of such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway's present wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, as she passes rakfisk trays and, with her long blond mane and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, a prudent people".
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like to brag, we don't like to show off".
Norway has managed its oil wealth very carefully; all but a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was squandering money they didn't have in the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept its wallet tight.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy", says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk", he adds with a wriggly laugh.
I'm in the snow waiting in line for something to eat; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of many places where a rakfisk dinner is held, where diners vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV set has connected live with a presenter wearing a bird and surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision song contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard". I said, "I'm not going to do it.
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls out of his chair, perhaps beaten by aquavit.
Or maybe it's the fumes from all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start to his career
As Mexico's incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant discusses the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad these days.
In a city that, at best, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and assume the management of the nation.
He's faced with a difficult task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results under the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is mired in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a strong commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence", Mr. Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office.
"I'm going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal".
Before he teamed up with the president of the United States, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A highly populated and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions on the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A man of integrity
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Its residents credit it with the growth of tourism in the area and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city, you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which is a huge improvement over the cracked, bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques bearing his name at the entrance to a modern sports stadium and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will be able to make a real and lasting change", says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of Mr. Peña Nieto's party, the PRI.
"Particularly in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so badly needs".
After an uninterrupted 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
He also rejects the opposition's assessment that the new president is lacking in substance.
"He's a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, a person who knows how to listen".
However, across the state that's not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Neza Ciudad, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden beneath highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called upon to help fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than that of Ciudad Juarez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, he failed to address the femicide problem while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of turning a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain her tears while she shows me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner killed her.
"When I arrived at her house, it looked as if her body had been cleaned", recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared".
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana watches from the walls, next to a cross that reads one word: Justice.
Yet that's exactly what the family says has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
What they want is for you to just accept what they say and shut up".
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence", he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will come with a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope he will be the same kind of president he was when he was governor", says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
Yet that is precisely what the families of the victims of Neza City fear most.
Bradley Manning did not report ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors are trying to address allegations of abuse by Bradley Manning during his time in prison.
The trial focuses on Manning's time in Quantico military prison in Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the ill-treatment he now alleges he suffered while in military custody.
During the prosecution's interrogation of Manning at a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits by unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which was conducted during a hearing following the defense's request that the case be dismissed as his incarceration had been harsh and that it had already involved sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The Army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico military prison, where he was incarcerated under maximum security from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had described the treatment given to him by the co-ordinators as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms show no allegations of ill-treatment, though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concern about some matters and that the officers who visited him had spoken of these problems and had indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record these matters in the record.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after having talked about the problems) but this does not necessarily mean that I would not have mentioned any problems", Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he was receiving during the January 2011 meeting with a council tasked with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain a reduction in the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine and (wanted) to stop being on injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life", Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that he once fainted from the heat.
He said the fact that he wasn't allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to that cage", Manning explained Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage".
Manning claimed that once transferred to Quantico, he spent most days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often 23 hours, unaccompanied.
Manning said all he was allowed to have was a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, since it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing at his eyes while he slept.
He said if the guards couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they'd wake him up so he could turn around again.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about the treatment Manning was receiving.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday's statement, according to which, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the guards and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's questioning Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order from the janitor that he should drop the blanket he might have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he might have used the rubber band on his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but that he hadn't.
Manning testified that that night his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through while in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted at the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to misdemeanors and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules that apply to all detainees being held under maximum security at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include collaboration with the enemy, unlawful incitement to publish information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted on all counts, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many were forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just come down the esplanade and reached the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Signs pointed to two lines: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stood there for a few seconds not sure where to go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" my whole life.
It's ethnic shorthand, the same way my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italian".
I decided later on to be Mexican-American.
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, shorthand or scripts were not necessary.
He was just American.
I speak Spanish well enough to conduct an interview in this language.
But I don't have the level of vocabulary of a native and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and I got in the foreigners' queue.
I thought about that moment this week when the president-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda for the day, as it always is when the leaders of these two countries meet, was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at this time it is as likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as it is that he will venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a trade bloc in North America like the European Union.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, though he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of its territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that leads to the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how the Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that's really challenging is the relationship they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans who live in the United States.
Are we talking about a grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe a father or a mother or a grandparent, who was shut out of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time, that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, low education, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and having had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may not be clear at times, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
We are also aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look over our shoulders as if we were of an inferior class that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't be trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in America but, still, as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter are upset about it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she considers herself part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they're not part of either.
We love to listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things further, from what I've learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as makeshift "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be left alone with this idea, fellas.
It's only fair.
If some Mexicans are still not ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated a much shorter time ago.
I'm not sure.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the usual futile discussions about who started first, heaps of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed, and for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, even though the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything in pieces, whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional upheaval.
Perhaps this will make their fight even bloodier than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly stalemate could be unraveled.
A war that is neither won nor lost
At first glance, optimism seems very difficult to justify at present.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has been beaten up.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on the 1.7 million people of Gaza in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals in Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As the Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been Israel's closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
The exultant Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the militia-party Hezbollah dominates, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels could topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, didn't have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas's cousin and its leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, the hard-line Israeli side will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military question is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep more peacefully... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, in part because the barrier corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of territory aspiring to become a Palestinian state, and protects the growing Jewish settlements despite being illegal under international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even more hard-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 elections, is in a good position.
Why spoil those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If you really governed the West Bank, wouldn't you fire rockets like your compatriots have in Gaza?
Better to have them behind that wall and give them a good punch if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will prevail, though the Arab Spring might alter his calculations.
While Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere may not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the superpower in the region will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think long term.
As the rest of the Arab world becomes more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination is creating a powder keg that will one day explode in the occupied territories, in the same way that a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics are making the situation worse as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to repel Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains what sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper are advocating: two states and the ceding of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the flow of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented position to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arab outsiders should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the impending attempt to obtain virtual state status at the UN.
Mr Obama also has an important role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Back in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to pay attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The tobacco packaging law comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and sick parts of the body are displayed on dim-green packets, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first tobacco and generic packaging law is enacted in Australia, replacing the logos and colors of brands with a muted olive green wrapper, gruesome images of diseased body parts and depictions of children and babies who are sick because their parents are smokers.
Apart from the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, which are mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small type of font.
This is the strictest regime in the world for tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says that the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make the habit glamorous.
He trusts studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand", said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies claimed that the law would encourage the black market in tobacco, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"The legislation will have serious unintended consequences", said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
The amount of tobacco that will be brought in by counterfeiters from China and Indonesia to sell on the streets of Australia will increase.
Others say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned business, claimed that the demand for bottle caps and silicone covers to cover the nasty images on the packages had skyrocketed almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law in the Australian Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha claimed that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale outlets and was expecting more stocks.
"It's a good deal for us".
According to experts, the potential obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector targeted by the plan.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most retailers to keep cigarettes out of sight, tobacco marketing has moved to online.
Australia has banned internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign websites.
"If you're a tobacco marketer and you only have this little window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be", said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews from "common citizens" posted on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It is not enough to say that the Commission has not taken the necessary steps to ensure that the Commission's proposals are implemented.
British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry is focusing more on the implications of the new regulations than on marketing.
Industry has even paid for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar laws to tobacco packaging.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce mandatory inclusion of images in the box.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia many smokers are defiant.
"The photographs do not affect me.
I just don't listen to them".
"You take the cigarette and you keep the package", says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter".
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
"Usually it took an hour to unfold a delivery; now it takes four", says Yu.
"The government should have completely banned tobacco and then, that's it, okay, it's over and we closed the store", he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get a little bored.
During this year's Thanksgiving holiday, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying in had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, not to mention duty-free shops.
But a growing number of academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
They say it's okay for us and our children to get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So should we accept boredom in a good way?
- I know.
And no, you didn't.
But we'll talk about that later.
First, I assumed, like many people, that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History", published in 2011 by Yale University Press, claims, this is not the case.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very long", he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century A.D.
We also need to ask ourselves how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a wide variety of ways", says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After examining published research and presenting the idea to a 100-person panel, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "wishing, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you".
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the disturbance of the attention process, associated with low mood and a feeling that time is passing slowly".
Boredom can sound terribly like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to view the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed view the problem as their own.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what actually happens is we have trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups listened in the next room to a full-loud television program that was unrelated, others listened at a low volume so that it was barely noticeable, while the third group did not listen to the audio at all.
The group that listened to the program at a lower volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they had difficulty concentrating, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, attention disturbance can lead to boredom", said Mark J. Fenske, professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study's authors.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts on a production line, distracting music can help you not get bored".
"In fact, we now know that moving or scribbling, actions often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, since they make the person more physically alert".
"Research shows that children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it's like to get bored at some point: a delayed plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more prone to boredom than others.
To help measure this, some researchers developed a "boredom tendency scale" in the 1980's.
The scale includes questions such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything".
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically they need more and more varied external stimulation.
But generally speaking, teenagers are a group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by searching.
He found that 32 percent of the teenagers said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But what he did know, he said, was that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest levels", largely because both children and adolescents are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: Is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, for when taken to the extreme, it can expose us to absurd physical risks, such as gambling or drug use as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this question for more than two decades.
"Boring is the brain's way of telling you that you should be doing something else", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch television, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself", says Professor Fenske.
And "that capacity to dose applies to other situations", he notes.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself but also learns to exercise better control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our aim should be, rather, to feel comfortable away from the constant buzz of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with you.
"In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and disturbing a desire to be associated with something worthwhile", he says.
He points out that what people really seek is a way to disconnect and enjoy a downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly overexcited", he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops".
Colorado: no instruction book for new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old community college student and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, faces criminal prosecution for what will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one September day, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses that each carry a fine of 100 U.S. dollars) in which he was informed of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals", says Orozco.
And are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the answer in hundreds of minor drug possession lawsuits depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana possession charges are being dismissed both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law is in effect in the coming weeks.
But the more conservative District Attorneys in Colorado have pledged to move forward with the open marijuana possession cases and are still subpoenaing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to stop newly licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This is all changing so fast that I don't know what's next", said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, just east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also turning the tables on the matter.
And they are still seeking advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale licenses, all before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent to serve as a model", he says.
Washington's law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that must be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to offer "adequate access" to licensed marijuana and its prohibition on conducting cannabis businesses within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children's playgrounds or children's centers.
"Nowhere will it be harder to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Aurora Police Chief Oates emailed his police officers that the city prosecutor would stop prosecuting people over the age of 21 for minor marijuana possession and that police would stop charging those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police Chief Oates said they would enforce city regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and would continue to pursue drug dealers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue marijuana possession cases, mainly to pressure consumers to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people are facing charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, though many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offences which at the time they occurred were a crime", Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative on marijuana legalization.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer call adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I do not consider it a waste of time to continue enforcing the law until it changes", he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana into the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that are emerging throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
"It's a cultural barrier to the district attorneys", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana possession defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They've spent so much time taking people to court that they really can't accept it's legal", he said.
By being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are poised to become the nationwide test cases for drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials are counting on a new frontier of legal sales, they are also eagerly awaiting guidance from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of marijuana legalization are hoping the Justice Department will relent.
Although there have been some notable arrests of patients and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"While drug enforcement officials are unlikely to pull down doors to seize a small bag of drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, which is permitted under the new law", said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for the federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments passed moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose passed a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level", explained City Councilman Bob Nicholson.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We're studying what the community voted for versus what the state voted for".
Many questions arise about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed and kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack college students for their views just now
I can't remember a time in my life when I wasn't dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been to what I supposed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late '80s to pursue a degree in history, I had packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were baffled.
The Evening Standard claimed that I had quit because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson jokingly announced that I had left because I was forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my fancy name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, which was that the cradle of the alleged illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may wonder what that comes to now.
Well, various reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of Conservative party students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same level of rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College JCR (graduate student group) claim that they are "often seriously ostracized, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people" for their political views.
They want to create a position on the college's equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their opinions freely.
Their situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and which portrayed the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a silver-handled cane.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated like "turkey heads" by the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19, and president-elect of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are center-right has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment as well as to the well-being of members", he says.
During my first few weeks at Oxford I was more than one.
I entered college in September 1986, a terribly shy 18-year-old girl.
Hatred of the Conservative Party was at its height.
The year before, the university had voted to deny former student Margaret Thatcher an honorary degree following cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcoming new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a taste of the bitterness that awaited me.
I found that professors not only turned a blind eye to the ridicule of conservative university students but willingly participated in it.
The policy of miners' strike, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the wooden halls of the seminar.
The first one I attended was an English translation of 18th-century French texts, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt", said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph".
I didn't say a word.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cookie dough, knew how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that Thatcherites refuse to learn French or are they simply stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes burned with tears I tried to hold back.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people", Pitt grunted.
I went back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's the way it goes.
They mess with anyone they suspect of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many new Tories appear to be Labour".
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to cover it up.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated".
Other students adopted that little song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"You beat each other up, don't you?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the '60s.
Could I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I become a Labourist and repress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, professor of contemporary history assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only from the Conservative party, but also Thatcher's foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote her speeches.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here", he told me.
I began to travel daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded metropolitan family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he was a student there in the '40s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my Communist friends have always had a flawless attitude".
Her painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they've done it just for fun.
It'd break my heart if you left".
Exhausted from so many trips to London, my emotional resilience was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who was also a supporter of the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar where another professor of history had insinuated, speaking in all seriousness, that I was an "enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "stupid old men".
The truce was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford college career.
By then my father was writing two weekly columns for the Murdoch Press.
My door was locked.
I was cuddled inside in fear and, after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
You may call me a weak weeping woman.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Conservative prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind an unworthy reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", an apoteosic retrospective that brings together more than 130 high-fashion dresses created by his "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the culmination of a story whose sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first room of the exhibition, open until 3 March, is filled with private letters and photos signed by the most distinguished members of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino shows off those personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from humble fashionista in the northern Italian town of Voghera to international jet-set idol.
There's nothing wrong with being in love with royalty.
"At least they don't put their cock-popping on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his villa in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, close to forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza also forgets the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
Every detail of the apartment, the decor, the food, the music, everything was seen and felt by his spirit.
"He made each of the guests feel important and loved", recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
"He never goes out of style because his designs are works of art", he concludes.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-reciprocated loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-meter-long catwalk that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk to contemplate a dream "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress chosen by Jackie Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume used by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among the crowd of mannequins are names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modisto, in 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a gilet jacket and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors he uses, they're very bright and they're "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescription Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco may forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of being old enough and having the opportunity to wear one of her evening gowns...
Finally, the time came in the late '90s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear to a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with a flying skirt, draped corsage and a slip of the tongue.
"It was a dream come true", says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York, and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her party dresses from the fashion designer with "the utmost care... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the dressmaker calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory-colored silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace, and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, a leading authority on the world of fashion, the dress represents a milestone in late 20th-century haute couture, "the return of high-class customers".
For years obscured by the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now their best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
"I've always been impressed by its refinement, its calmness, its clean and perfect appearance", D'Arenberg admits.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was at the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not pass for him".
If a princess says so...
The toughest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano porters risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do so, it must descend daily to the bottom of its crater, where sulfur gas emanating from the Earth's interior solidifies upon contact with air.
After plucking large sulphur rocks, which weigh some 70 kilograms in total, he carries them in two bamboo baskets and carries them on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 meters, but the exhausted porters take more than 40 minutes to climb up the turtle's foot, keeping their balance and carefully measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall off the precipice.
They know that any slip and fall could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago over the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulfur they mine
Once up, they make their way among tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tirelessly carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at an altitude of 1,800 feet [1,850 m].
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better, its workers, who are paid 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then he sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees [$1,200] each trip", explains Anto, who usually makes three deliveries a day.
He spends three hours on each and ends up crushed, but he is allowed to collect 138,000 rupees (11,5 euros) by the end of the day.
As miserable as it may seem for such an inhuman effort, it's three times what I'd make in the field.
"The miners' pay is very high here, where coffee harvesting is paid at 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros)", explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (€6.2) a day and the cut was not so harsh, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as compelling as sulphur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing and irritation of the eyes by toxic gases
At 27, Anto has been playing the Kawah Ijen for three years, and the sulfur has already started to pay off despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathing difficulties, constant coughing, and eye irritation from the toxic gases released by the volcano.
It's the price you must pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French", he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this nice, intelligent young man might be a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur keeps shining at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and glows in the midst of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself up with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or supplied any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and under such weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera surcharge that, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee, the park guards charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This job is for beasts and not for people", protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old hard-working porter who has been at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, she says she will work "as hard as she can" because she needs the money to educate her three children, aged between 18 and 10.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and drips out the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious illnesses - beyond, of course, their usual breathing problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik can now only carry 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Each day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat-trail through the bush.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life", proclaims Unainik, opening her mouth wide, where several teeth are missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, aged 30, also works as a sulfur loader.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world's toughest crafts - that of the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and the cost of property and education for not having children.
"Singapore's population needs to grow".
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and create life!
It may seem improbable that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (cake) in the oven" to mock Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, hopes that with the advert they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do "their national duty".
This is purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst in the world at reproducing ourselves, so we felt this was an issue we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought, why don't we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is the Singapore government.
Spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as the replenishment rate - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies at the National Population Division, says it is because of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family", he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where scarcely disguised xenophobia abounds against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore's ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to keep the small houses from being built.
For example, it has started to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a surface area of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there are concerns that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell out much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units sell out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it a lot better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hindered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the city centre it seems that they will not have much effect.
"People are under a lot of stress, housing is expensive, and so is education, so many people are putting it off", says one young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But it's important to me to have my own money and time", says another young man in his 20's.
Men and women cite career, stress, and the cost of property and education as reasons for not having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, Singaporeans have the final say.
Private offline is private online
Privacy, you know.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that one has the right to protect from any intrusion".
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by spreading online situations that you would probably not share offline?
The paper interviewed five boys aged 10 to 15 who are frequent net users.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very personal", on a personal level, and "in the password and username", when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't put my deepest secrets on a post", says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret, my mom can know them, but not everyone", she says.
I'm posting pictures of games or something.
I also entertain my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not mine, or someone who's making a fool of himself", he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to post obscene pictures, of naked people, of crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother's included, she's got the key to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just put them up", he adds.
"Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly", she says.
I'm sure you'll answer that I would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who recommended a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts open on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friend list.
"I'm not scared, because we have something in common, music for example", she says.
According to the boy, no one has ever hinted at or asked for his home address or phone number.
"If I'm pressured or demanded, I just take it out of my account", he admits.
José became a follower of Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who I was", she says.
The victim, according to José, didn't close the account.
"Just gave him privacy".
Then he explains a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would, if I didn't like it or if I wanted to.
"I know that's cyberbullying", he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, the purpose of social networks should be understood as informing.
"The Internet was originally a search engine, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed", he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master's in pedagogy from Yale University and author of Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning", he says.
He says the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age when maturity is not for that".
"They also have to be selective when their main concern is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers about privacy is through thought-provoking questions.
"Telling them not to do it is no good", he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like to have a photo of you posted like you posted a friend?
You know what other people post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people's permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they should act online as they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, one acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be true on social networks", he says.
The Commission
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential for parents to read the policies of social networks.
By understanding each of these, they have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or post", he says.
According to Guardia, it's key to remind children of the lesson of "don't talk to strangers".
UNASUR summit ends without making public the Lima Declaration
The sixth presidential summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publicity of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending leaders.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but sources from the Chancellery and the Presidency pointed out at first that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but later they affirmed that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted on the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Access to the Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information that circulated among reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of assistant presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit between South America and the Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite press press pressures, the so-called Lima Declaration was not released.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be confirmed that the document was published last Tuesday.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made efforts to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will accept and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today", said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful resolution of controversies, of treaties and of international courts", Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact for which it had accepted to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua that it considered gravely erroneous.
The summit was held without the assistance of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The mandate read the final document in which he informed that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were set for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residence agreements".
He said that actions are being taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, access to low-cost internet in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to glimpse a better future for our peoples", added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits", the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transversal axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reincorporation into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, and of good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his peer from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega", Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua", he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we should handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are expected to meet on Saturday in Mexico to attend the inauguration of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's Defence Ministers met previously to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"Suramerica must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "Suramerica, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the VI Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans "killed each other in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
He defended the project to establish South American citizenship, which is encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"We must achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", he warned.
The Ecuadorian President also expressed his support for the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret his decision because he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected".
He also criticized the Swedish justice system for demanding that he be interrogated in his own country for a presumed sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious", the Ecuadorian president said.
What is true is that there is a danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health because you are confined to a small space and cannot exercise outdoors.
"That complicates the health of anyone", he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a salvage permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances", he said.
And he said that "if Britain gives safe passage tomorrow this is over".
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly permits and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will be over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he does not tolerate is "mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which degrade freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion", he said.
In this regard, he congratulated that it was no longer these journalists "nor the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected "he will deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the coup d'état vested in legality" because in reality "destroyed the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
That ruling is not being followed at the moment.
It's a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We have to process them extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also expressed confidence in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept a ruling no matter how hard it is".
Referring to the possibility of being a candidate in the next presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador's, that socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that probable victory, because we have to accept that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it'll be my last term as president, and that's when we're out of public life.
If we lose anyway.
"It's a decision", he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro and he tells me that he traveled for a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he tested positive for AIDS.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me", he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "more gentle", without apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inquire about it; with such determination that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is, without a doubt, one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he joined in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options, and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was carrying a cut".
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it's possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, many people, unaware of their illness, still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "depleting" their immune system, and falling victim to opportunistic infections.
31 years after the first cases of AIDS were reported, "the great achievement means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the HCG, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectologist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of affect on the immune system that patients present at the start of diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that those diagnosed with HIV at age 25 "can live without problems until age 75", the interviewee explained.
To gauge this progress, it is worth remembering that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in Mexico the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of the patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths until May of this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it happened in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years, we haven't had a shortage of medicine. The problem is that patients come in very late because they don't know their infection status, which is late in the disease.
He gave a powerful data: "Nine out of ten patients arrive with some opportunistic infection, and what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make diagnoses earlier and therefore to offer mass screening to all people who need it".
His proposal is agreed by specialists and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (Coesida), as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to a particular laboratory to get tested, motivated only because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, I better blow myself up three times a week", they say no to me.
The change was for the better, I eat right, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I am co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person", said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, in the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them get tested, if they were at risk, the sooner they know they're HIV positive, the better, and if they're diagnosed, let them learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle motto for AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
The gaps between health programs and the common citizen are large, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken on the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the condom distribution has increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that's very good but it turns out that there are those who today, still, do not have access to a condom", he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sorna and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed to reorient this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not be just behind the counter and those 100 should be in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
It's not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them for chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if there would have been a condom distribution in his Administration.
"Sexuality is not like that, the best thing is to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity", he said.
The key in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks fourth nationally in new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections are by sexual transmission, 6% by blood transmission and 2% by perinatal transmission.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for every recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a US appeals court, a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved via a commercial tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would seem, then, that the survival guarantee procedures for signatures permitted by Mexican law are not valid in the land of the stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In practice, the backlash against the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
For starters, while the trial judge notes that creditors must be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the main proceeding is the commercial competition in Mexico.
The first point would be to ignore international procedural cooperation in insolvency cases involving transnational companies.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created to that end, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Second, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, which recognised in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts which Vitro's subsidiaries had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case where the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were approved by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth is that, in any case, the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have won a majority, even if the votes of the subsidiaries are subtracted.
The vote would have been 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal omits that fact.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 onwards, in the wake of the severe economic crisis facing the United States, hitting the country hard.
For now, the González Sada family's firm will file a reconsideration appeal before the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full court, that is, the five judges, since only three voted.
If this does not succeed, the appeal will be taken to Cerciorare, which will require review of the case by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court overruled a document sent by the Mexican government under the guise of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that it was dismissed in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it to chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-way street: they hit Vitro and they hit the country.
The balance sheet
After several months of complaints placed on the table by the Mexican Aviation unions against the company's former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Syndical Association of Aviators Pilots has already found the bottle neck.
The inquiry headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Value Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General's Office on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the F/589 trust fund of Banco IXE, in the name of Mexican Aviation.
The funds would have been channelled to the purchase of shares in the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They're closing on the Dragon Mart.
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of Wall Country products, with a cottage area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that razed with part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the hidden against the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has ignored a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Commercial Agreement, known by its acronym in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property. The matter has already been filed.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long term homex
In an effort to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, housing developer Homex is placing on the market Bursátiles Certificados for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Basketball worlds Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of local basketball history as extensive as does Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor league player, a player of the National Senior Basketball, an attorney and leader in the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put on many hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, such as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the 90s", Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia denoting his extensive career, bear witness to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all the ones he treasures with the most emotion are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old serving as co-owner or owner of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as an attorney, co-attorney or manager.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted on BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz took over, who was a great administrator", Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been here and was at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, he said to me, "I've got a really strong player, 6'7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember you said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another one.
The Vaqueros championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but at a distance, because by 1988 he was already a federative boss.
By then I'd rather enjoy his and Mincy's performances on the national team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the pre-Olympics in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth and it should have been bronze if not for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
That group from the 1990 World Cup is the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's one of the best, just like the one he won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a shell to the U.S. team, which was pretty similar to the one that won us bronze at the Worlds.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Tonito" Colón and young James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90 due to a knee injury.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Mar del Plata Pan American mess, we won gold against all odds.
Who's been the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was definitely Little Ortiz.
His numbers at the international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as Piculin did.
And that's not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who's been the best leader in Puerto Rico?
That's very difficult.
We've had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest accomplishment in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, like the regionalization of the minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now, kids are traveling and playing too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruits of the compulsory certifications and coursework for executives, desk officers and referees.
I'm pleased to hear that.
What are you doing now?
Mostly I listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R"., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played a ruthless, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by "Dallas" production house Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most", the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died at a Dallas hospital, her publicist, Jeffrey Lane, said.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'm gonna miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had been drinking heavily for years.
In 1995 he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a liver transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he meets an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him in his home.
He was also the star of two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Her film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful portrayal of the charmingly abominable J.R. that brought Hagman to his greatest star.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate anticipation around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars risked by bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record-breaking viewership at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in, making "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to call her a prostitute unless she left town, but others had motive to attack him, too.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), committed.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s headstone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal you lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen".
It's unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us, who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
The network reported that five episodes of the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in the works.
There was no immediate pronouncement from Warner or TNT on how the series will handle the loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she had it in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met and married the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he published his memoir "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything in there that I thought was going to hurt anyone or affect them in any way", he told the Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I counsel them, I encourage them, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and afterwards", he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's going to be a little awkward for a short time, but you're going to be okay".
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
They start a course exploring the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people have held as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "Armageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian end-time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there's ever been", Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If you look at what's been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those of you with the apocalyptic mindset.
And he's not the only professor to teach courses on the "end of the world" this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple, adjunct professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Mediums, Culture, and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time", he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month the students analyzed apocalyptic-themed movies and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, probable, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled simply "The End of the World".
"We didn't add '2012' to always have the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end", Restall said.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours", Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We've been getting e-mails for weeks and weeks before the semester starts, from people asking if there's still room.
The students, on the other hand, say that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old graduate student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the point is that the apocalyptic mindset, secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing graduate student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that", he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - much less a teacher - said he believed in the expiration date of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and we kind of discredited it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, going back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"Other places people don't think about this", he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew of any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world", he wrote, implying an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many doomsday days have been talked about over the years, and he said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they were thinking of going to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends and we'll have a laugh together", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
