At the end of the exchange, the Prague stock exchange swung in the negative
Following the fall on Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily trade.
On Tuesday, from the start of the exchange, the Prague stock exchange resumed its fall from the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This is due to the fall in Wall Street stocks.
The market reaction to the result of the vote of the U.S. House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the U.S. financial sector, is thus also perceptible in our country.
Falling stocks in Asia
Asian stock markets experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although the indices managed, over the course of the day, to erase part of the losses.
The Hong Kong stock exchange Hang Seng index lost four percent during trading, but later wiped out part of the losses and reduced the drop to 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong stock exchange lost 3.8 percent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually managed to reduce the losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 percent.
“The hesitation about the U.S. rescue action will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong’s monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it sets its own monetary policy, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are the same as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries could be affected.
The bloodshed of American stocks
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the project to support the financial system, to which it should have devoted up to $700 billion (nearly 12 trillion Kčs).
The lawmakers rejected the call to support President George W. Bush’s project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodshed on Monday and the main stock indices saw the biggest drop in 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost seven percent, having experienced such a drop for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gives in: U.S. government can inject $700 billion into banks
Leaders of the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader form of financial aid agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to vote at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers made a decisive turning point in negotiations on the adoption of a bailout plan in the form of $700 billion (about $12 trillion) of financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
However, success is not certain.
Indeed, before they can publish the final version of the law and submit it to vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the deal.
The support plan for the financial system will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Regulation, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, as early as Wednesday, the plan should be submitted to the Senate for a priori vote.
According to economists, the announcement that the bailout plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor to revive financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which aid to markets can be effective, there will be a “disillusion.”
The plan must be effective.
“We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the shape that the package of measures for market stabilization should take," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could be held on Sunday.
In the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give the government a final shape.
It is expected to buy up, from financial companies, non-selling real estate assets that result in significant losses for financial companies and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
“We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to continue, but I think we are there,” Paulson said.
A Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a considerable impact on falling stock markets.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are making sure Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before the start of trading on Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where the decision of Congress could affect Monday’s exchanges.
At the moment, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two houses of the U.S. Congress will vote, or whether the negotiations are not likely to be blocked, at the last moment, by one issue or another.
Legislators hope it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, the law will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount allocated to the system should be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, should be available as soon as possible.
But, if Congress has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the option to block the allocation of the remaining amount, following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush welcomes progress in negotiations
Although the president can veto this decision, Congress has the option of putting it in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which consisted of obtaining funds for the redemption of bad real estate securities, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, wasined.
“All work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to pass the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George W. Bush is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Reduction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, says lawmakers have agreed on the accountability of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers against losses, the agreement on depreciation, the development of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of such golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee, which will oversee the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides for aid for property owners, who have trouble paying.
The government should negotiate new levies in the case of mortgages it is going to redeem, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Tagged: psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance chief economist David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we don't know what the mechanism and price will be for the repurchase of the problematic assets.
This point will be crucial in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not so important.
“It is much more important that congressmen agree, this week, that they support this plan and that they will dedicate it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at this time," Marek said.
A struggle pushed to the extreme: MP3 players against mobile phones.
We will advise you how to choose.
While almost all mobile phones can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It seems to result clearly that it is better to buy only a phone.
There are plenty of reasons to find an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for home a high-end expensive gramophone to put on Maxim Turbulenc’s new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason, for this to happen.
Now, if there are in your shelves packed vinyl discs, with art rock, jazz or blues, you are at least probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same is true of music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to put it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have a hard time with headsets bought for twenty crowns on the market.
Here are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The battery life is also crucial.
Some high-end music players are able to do much more than just play music, but these are features unknown, of course, to most mobile phones.
No device today is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephone calls and SMS sending, it is able to play music and movies, record them, it has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, up to serve for navigation.
And if you consider smartphones and communicators, you will have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no refrigerator knows how to grille meat and no television will take photos, we are practically witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without disadvantages.
The larger the number of functions you use, the shorter the interval between two recharges will be.
And reading music is one of the most important energy gains.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this regard, music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly more performing.
In the case of cheap mobile phones, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you happen to call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second recharger for work - this is true even for the more expensive devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 players, which are capable, as a result of a recharge, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the less performing.
Another problem occurs when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited portion of the devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer, without special software.
You can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to handle it without reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobile phones.
As for the players, you do not need, except for the exception (iPod), any software.
Simply fill the music device from the computer via the USB connector.
Most mobile phones and players will create a media library by themselves, sorted by the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or the user’s judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobile devices have more know-how
When choosing a concrete device, you are primarily concerned with the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you are going to listen to it only for a limited time, for example, taking the tram, you just need any mobile reader MP3.
Almost all mobile phones are now capable of this.
You don’t even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile phone or player is able to play.
Everyone gets to play MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will get up to you will have just this format.
It is one of the most common formats and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can also play WMA music.
The AAC (format used by the firm Apple and its iPods), on the other hand, is less common.
High-end mobile phones also allow, for example, the purchase of music online.
Simply visit, from the mobile phone, the corresponding web pages of the operator (or those of another provider) and purchase the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a convincing reason to acquire a musical mobile.
The offer of the operators is unfortunately miserable and is limited, in most cases, to fast-made radio tubes.
Prices are also not the lowest.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, internet, or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their mobile phones with them.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you just have to take the phone out of your pocket, while you have forgotten your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you always have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If not, you can use the built-in speakers, which almost all mobile phones have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of mobile music is their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three-four thousand crowns, one can have a already very suitable walkman.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of an outlet for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best phones and the best-equipped, also equipped with an entry for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone manages to secure the order of the most rudimentary readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a randomly connected mobile internet, followed by a huge data transfer bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (the type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even considering the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models support only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can survive even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1,100 SEK.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, instead choose specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent MP3 control keys, which makes the ease of control closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose phones in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the most far in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Per
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering practically the same services as their Western European partners.
Despite this, we still lack something – a virtual operator, which would force traditional traders to lower prices.
It may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz that Czech carriers are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (The Czech Telecommunications Office), which that the price of a SMS was higher in our country than in the rest of the Union, also confirmed this.
This is why, following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may occur - SMS sent from abroad will be cheaper for some customers of Czech mobile operators than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of a competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may sound paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, is choreographing with the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with its own network apparently no longer has much luck (by the way, now he would hardly find frequencies).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has resulted in a considerable price drop, to which conventional operators had to react as well.
Nevertheless, even before the entrance of holiday troubles such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those we hear today in Britain were being heard.
Now, it turned out that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February, we informed you about the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Add that behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are exempt from the relatively high cost of building, operating andining the mobile network.
This is how in the world, virtual operators profile themselves as low-cost operators – they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by a limited range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS in the UK at least twice as cheap as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, betting on an unusual target group can also be a good advertisement.
This activity is specifically aimed at men.
“Real men choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would likely work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesman, doubts: “The Czech market is relatively small for a segmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the service supply."
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there will be a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promising.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
Instead, they try to do everything they can to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera group, which would thus want to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not hidden, for long enough, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
“We look forward to being able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner it will be the best.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we managed to move forward in the negotiations," said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
The future may be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we may be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
“At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to others very specific.
At the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," said Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefonika O2, in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not registered for the moment a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a base."
And she adds: "It is virtually excluded that a virtual operator will appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited timeframe, we should have a concrete agreement right now.”
Vodafone instead focuses its attention on fulfilling requests to obtain its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says in this regard: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we think means the most contribution from the customer’s point of view.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The move of the mobile operators is easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a drop in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profits.
What is the point of creating such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to feel like thieves at the fair. The chicane that accompanied the creation of the U:fon also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on the ČTÚ, at the time of the creation of the U:fon, was that of the company T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from the ČTÚ web pages.
However, today, the U:fon is prepared to serve as an argument for not accepting a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: “In addition, the competition in the mobile market has recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands.”
But given the attitude of mobile operators like this, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, in the face of this problem, he adopted his typical position.
The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential stakeholders has not a priori shown sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the ÚOHS Department of Foreign Relations in response to our question.
Such a statement would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
But from the side of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a statement is more than confusing.
Especially as Kristián Chalupa adds: “In the overseas, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a drop in the prices of mobile phone services.”
However, pressuring the market to function fairly and lower prices is apparently not in the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concorde of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question, whether this really is a coincidence, arises naturally.
Similarly, a strictly identical price of gasoline at all gas stations is probably due to the chance and to the harsh fight of competition.
“The Office has not identified any signs of anti-competitive behavior in this regard, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and none therefore has a corresponding increased responsibility for their behavior on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably lacking even in the telecommunications regulator," Chaloupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is a relevant market analysis by the ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitutes, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts propose a different view of things: in order for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, it is necessary to obtain, each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are apparently acting in a similar way.
Nevertheless, complaints from many stakeholders (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Bringing responsibility back to the ČTÚ is a fairly common turn in communications, with which the ÚOHS washes hands of the affair.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the new Telecommunications Act, which was recently adopted, failed to extend the powers of the ČTÚ in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised an improvement of the situation.
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must very well know, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can walk.
That said, the operation of a sort of pseudo-virtual operators, many in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile phone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, it is about companies dealing with multi-level marketing.
Customized mobile phone services are provided by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
Pricing lists of these firms usually reach only elected members.
The magic turn consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator figure of a classic business customer, who commands a large amount of SIM cards.
As a major customer, she gets special (and other) price deals.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you are talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we would be examining and that could result in the cessation of the collaboration with the company in question," Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
Nevertheless, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such activity has not reached the leaders of mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
No operator, however, is opposed to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them not negligible profits, and at the same time, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot dispose of it fully, in the way of ordinary customers of mobile operators.”
This is exactly what should seem strange in the ČTÚ.
There is also another question in the UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively wide powers to be able to disclose such activity, and if it will not want to be content with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibiting it.
We are no longer the most expensive country.
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable drop in the price of services.
However, in virtually every country where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a too small or even too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
Now, it is precisely at this level that regulatory bodies in developed countries intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and informal pressure, they ended up achieving the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are dealing with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is removed by passing it on to a nearby target.
As a result of the experience we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is more than beneficial to them in these cases.
But don’t throw the sleeve after the stroke.
If the behind-the-scenes information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear with us, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain impasse in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Anthem.
On the occasion of the Czech Nationality Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov můj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo singing, a choir interpretation and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the arrangements of the anthem.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech National Anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously told Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the singers' solo versions with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the choir, have a good diction, so that the words are well understood, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde domov můj was first sung in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (Theatre of States) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse of Savetiers), a Czech original play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously appropriated it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couplet became naturally an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the “new” hymn sounds
Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce chip in their ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will board the metro, trams and buses, who, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic voucher in their pocket.
Currently, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a 30-day or 90-day voucher (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and register it on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to purchase coupons online on the websites of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 people took advantage of the service during the morning.
Those who will begin to use the online store may forever forget the checkpoints in the metro stations, where they had until now to impairing in long queues in order to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon over the internet and save it on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is a checkpoint with trained staff available to passengers, who will help interested parties with online purchases and, in addition, record the coupon they purchased on their card," said Martin Opatrný, a project spokesman.
Alongside libraries, it will also be possible to save electronic coupons on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the hallway of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, they remind the machines to compose tickets and passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
“Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty,” Opatrný added.
An automaton will control the coupon in the driver’s place
The machines that will operate from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register on the card itself.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also around the city.
Namely, in the peripheral trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are mainly used by the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrovaná doprava (Prague integrated transport), controllers are equipped with map readers, with which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained ticket control Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which designs the timetables of Prague public transport.
Periurban buses are equipped with card readers built into the driver’s box.
When boarding, it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard in the indicated place on the side of the box.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In the event that the passenger would need to check the validity of the coupons registered, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take the suburban buses and will not remember the date when their coupon expires, can join the automatic distributors again, which were originally used to save the coupons on the card.
This is where, on the screen of the device, information about the validity of their document will appear.
Sudans call for U.S. referendum
In 1945, the Sudet Germans demanded that Šumava be integrated into the United States.
This is derived from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we at least want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudet Germans allegedly addressed the President of the United States with such a desire.
This arises, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
In the letter, Germans from Český Krumlov beg the US president not to allow the "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation well and we want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of the Šumava cares."
Given that the reunification with Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, reckless attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take the Šumava protectorate into his hands for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has contributed in no way to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of a quarter-million of its inhabitants," the letter reads.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the “Czech oppressors.”
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given current knowledge of postwar history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Sudet Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans at least had to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would obtain some kind of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as a German from České Budějovice, engaged in the Navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once back home, the Czech would be beneficial to them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war estimated, according to him, that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don’t think – you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from dangerous conduct while driving.
The 150-million-dollar campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, on the internet, but also on tracks.
It should discourage drivers from fast driving and alcohol driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
It wants to touch the awareness of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also evidenced by the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
You don’t think – you pay!
The phrase "You don't think" is written in major letters on the registration plate.
Then, in a bottle of blood, there is the phrase “You’ll pay.”
This should symbolize that one can pay for life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will hunt the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents are commonly seen.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
The Strategy of Sugar and Bite Against Drivers
“What works with drivers is the sugar and beet system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when grilling a red light.
The threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
Signals that warn drivers of danger are less effective.
“When a static warning panel is installed, it will probably quickly fuse with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it,” Kořán said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli provisional government, voted for the return of virtually all territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, or even all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without it, peace will not be made," he added.
He admits that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as it happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert said, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens were wounded.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic sites" located inside the Old Town.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he said later.
Retreat of the Golan Heights
Olmert also supported Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace deal with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan," he said.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support for terrorism from Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network), as well as Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," he said.
Questions arising after the accident: Are stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance car is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus company near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can move inside the bus during the journey.
"If one wanted to comply with the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the road traffic law," said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the road of the bus.
At that time, the girl was sadly sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat in the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the bus can have an accident, or even brake suddenly, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the bus is under its technical data equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing seat equipment is not approved, passengers must remain sitting.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing seats; which was confirmed to Aktuálně.cz by the company director Radim Jančura.
"This is a matter that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilet during the trip provided they have their own seat," he said.
The law ignores the steward.
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legal prescription deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal prescription also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The road transport law only knows the term vehicle receiver; it does not define his rights and duties," adds with more ambiguity the spokesman Hanzelka.
Josef Pokorný, director of the Department of Road Vehicle Traffic, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
“It all depends on whether the bus has permission to offer standing seats in its homologation.
Everything lies in it,” he said.
Buses are divided into urban, where there are standing seats and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing seats and a higher allowed speed and long-distance buses without standing seats with the highest allowed maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in a plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (Road Traffic Safety) on safety in transportation, does not see the displacement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"With regular traffic, there is no danger.The situation can be compared to that of service in airplanes.
There, too, it’s not sure when a turbulence will occur and the hostess of the air may hit her head.”
Now, in the event that the bus would have brakes abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Just like in a bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards through internal regulations," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer stewards services.
He hired two hundred.
Even after this accident, the manager does not regard their profession as a risky profession.
“H, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky profession, I will remove it.
Passengers can get their coffee and their diary on board.
This would also reduce costs,” he said.
The safety concern is the reason that the absence of stewards in its vehicles is given by the director of the Asiana Alexei Litvine, who ensures, compared with SA, a very small number of lines.
“We don’t have hostesses, we’ve been opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," he told Týden.cz a year ago.
A huge tragedy has occurred.
A young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had been working for the company for two years, died in the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop lane without using a flash and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he struck him by his right side.
Jančura denies that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these seats, they are blocked."
The company has filed a complaint against the truck driver.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but in terms of financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A change in the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide clarifications on the travel of stewards on board the bus.
“We have not come to any conclusions on this issue.
Honestly speaking, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the mobile phone at the wheel," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," said Hanzelka, adding that the control of the safety of buses is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf’s hopes rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not lacking in the letter the WestLB Board of Directors sent to the house employees.
By a merger of the entities of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of Sparkasse" could form, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a “competence block” doubled with sustainable productivity in such a deal.
In summary, such a relationship could be the decisive kick off for other concentrations in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a management committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under heavy pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority that has, only recently, made clear to the government of the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, there has been a discussion for some time already – also on the part of Frankfurt – of a relationship of some form between the bank Deka, which knows the customers of Sparkasse through their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of Deta-Bank, Franz Waas,ly said during the presentation of the six-month figures at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse house with a Land bank, be it Helaba or WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and by the savings funds groups, has commissioned the board of directors to conduct talks with the WestLB for joint business activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the negotiations have only just begun, it is said in the financial square.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, with its 3,000 employees, counts as one of the largest employers on Frankfurt’s financial square, comes into play when it comes to consolidating the savings funds sector.
In 2003 it was believed for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Rhine-Palatinat and Halbab.
Nothing has come out of this bullshit.
As soon as the plans had been made public, the government of the Land of Hesse voted against any participation of Hellaba in them.
The other two houses did not join either.
The Bank of the Land of the Palatinate Rhine was attached instead to the Bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new negotiations on the merger of Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Hellaba, however, opposed any business strategy of merger with his bank.
Despite this, the feeling seems to spread that the merger of the various public sector institutions is urgent.
Now that the elections to the Bavarian Land Parliament have passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg could first come true.
For Helaba, this is not good news.
If the pressure for new mergers increases, potential partners gradually escape it.
In the South, it would now be a junior partner, although it has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The grouping of Hesse-Thuringe savings and transfers, which owns 85 percent of the capital of Helaba, in turn pulled a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with the WestLB.
The NordLB would be strict.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one of the facets.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can match.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely through which business model the future capacity of the banks of the Länder should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German grouping of savings and transfers.
In the end, a dispatch of the WestLb could take place, dispatch which here is obviously not desired.
This is also what is mentioned in the letter of the existing board of directors: in any case, a ‘comprehensive solution’ for the establishment would be aimed at.
How all this will be put into the same basket with the merger of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the weekend of the Italians.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre Kaiser brand beer barrel, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer party visitors what deep sounds its gosier can produce.
Elena first hits Luca, then kisses her.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nova station, four buses depart tonight at 23:45, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', scheduled to arrive at 6:30.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel Brazilians exclusively.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing ores and already next to their flag, they have already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it’s not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long folded coat of fake fur and glasses with wide silver mountains.
For the past five years, they have gone to the beer festival, already three break this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and come home at 22:30.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a head of the German-speaking group - Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses run at night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There is no beer yet.
Soon everything becomes quiet in the bus, the passengers are asleep.
It will be better, they will still need their strength.
Pauses will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian checkpoints once again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When early in the morning Marco’s group finally arrives at 6:30 as planned on the parking lot near Theresia Square, 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the attack plan.
First, wearing the yellow hat.
On top is written on the left 'Fête de la bière', in Gothic, and next to it is the internet address of Marco's travel agency 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
“When the doors of the beer chapel open, we run,” Marco cried in the early morning.
Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
“Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow hats on the same benches, we have to distribute them in the room!”
The chop, Marco cries, costs 8.25 euros.
Do not forget the instructions!
“Tell the security officers that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave your places, they are gone!”
Third: “Tonight, being back here at ten and a half pile!”
Then we went to the beer party.
Along the way, someone binds yellow hats to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an electoral poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the “Italian Weekend”.
There are no precise figures; it is said that 50,000 are on their way across the Alps and collapse in the beer kiosk, with 10 percent of the visitors coming deliberately from Italy this weekend.
Munich police are reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries out statistics on the countries where Italians take the first place ahead of the British (60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with 200 medical interventions.
One that is appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the federal finance minister insisted just a few weeks ago.
What a fortune that the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate finance firm Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turbulence.
A person in confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that the aid credits are issued up to a sum of 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction it would be entitled to.
The money comes from private banks as well as public banks.
In the background, it is the Depfa subsidiary that bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced himself very short-term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also slightly decreased from 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, while profits from the allocation of certain credits and securities as well as the termination of provisions in credit transactions fell from more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
And it was only thanks to the significant profits derived from the reimbursement of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the Tax Procedures and Commercial Acquisitions Book for Konzern companies that the profit deficit of approximately 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially badly speculated on industrial real estate loans, which had later been affiliated with the bank Aareal.
Because conventional state financing was not cost-effective enough, Depfa was then more engaged in infrastructure projects and in the financing of private-state joint projects (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must carry out amortizations which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group’s gains and losses, which remains yet quite blurred.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had already been cut to two-thirds.
Since the acquisition of Depfa, Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor.
It is stronger than other institutions that depend on refinancing on the interbank market since it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks again slowed considerably, with banks accumulating liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term means of refinancing annually for a portion – approximately €50 billion – of all the credits of the Depfa.
According to a statement from Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financing needs are covered with medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of operation at the moment.
Other sources say refinancing will be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman of the Board of Directors Georg Funke, however, explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer have to resort to the financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for the Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the market capability of the Hypo Real Group is now ensured.
The bank’s shareholders and creditors can only hope.
However, given the dynamics and insurmountability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not unthinkable that funding should not be used in its entirety.
The opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest communications, still at the doors of insolvency on Sunday at the end of the evening, this rescue, at least provisional, will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The price of the stock fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond prices, on the other hand, go well.
While the first-tier debt has barely moved, the second-tier loan rates are flattening.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former Württemberg subsidiary Hypo and those of course that have a lifetime beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself that brought the crisis into the institution by the purchase of the bank Depfa.
As long as issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, we can assume a resorption of the downturns in time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to expect at the moment – that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed rumors of partial nationalization, the probability that was approaching certainty has now become a mere well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia primarily to long-term creditors on the decision whether or not they should separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn on to constitute a postponement of losses for the coming years on the next automatically levied capital income tax.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Box at Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to appear for her first day at High School in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German is so “kawaii”!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas – in her new Exchange Log, she talks about Japan.
First day of class in Japan.
What I was excited about.
On the way to school, I was scared.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I take a 40-minute train to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the classes does not seem to be as strictly fixed as in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after another from eight o'clock, until at nine o'clock less twenty, a table round begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don’t really like to talk in front of people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old shirt from my host mother, along with a shirt, blue climbing socks and black leather shoes.
In this dress so I presented myself in front of the pupitre, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all performed low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word “Kawaii.”
I knew him thanks to my memes.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teens and means "sweet, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assaulted in the rules.
Everyone was talking to who better, laughing and asking me a lot of questions – in this case, it’s pretty difficult to understand Japanese English.
During the break, they all walked out.
My host mother had also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really different from the miserable German casks.
I had aromatic herbs rice, small sausages, a salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and some sort of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What is certain is that everything is really good.
Well, except maybe the salty prunes confited, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento she has prepared herself, and which is then prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get a little better acquaintance with the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I wonder if I can see it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always answered:
“Because it fascinates me.”
After all, reading mangas is what I have preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture in them, at some point I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there someday.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here they are given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Rats also have emotions.
A rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean that he feels fear too?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without which I or anyone else has so far been able to prove it, just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we penetrate into terrain hardly practicable because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is faced with danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, runs away or attacks.
Humans behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral cortex (due to its participation in short-term memory and in direction and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and seems to be completely absent in other beings.
So at least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among which consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being even differs from other primates.
Another significant peculiarity might lie in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence being linked to language, this often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness should not depend on language, it would influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness may look like in other animals.
If this, internally and subjectively, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is beside another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine animal consciousness processes without considering their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies on primate short-term memory, with the example of visualization.
But in this approach, followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal cortex in achieving visualization.
But what does this mean for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) captures vivid memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially humans.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others than ourselves.
Conversely, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from primitive activities are born in the areas of body sensation of the cortex and brain trunk, just like Jaak Pankseep who, however, focuses more on the brain trunk.
Since this network hasn’t changed much during human evolution, it might quite participated in cross-sensations of all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I think it is undetectable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in humans and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: how could one verify whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Surely, the nerve comparison helps: rats and humans have similar brain trunks, while cockroaches don’t even have a brain.
But is the brain stem the source of sensations?
And even if we could prove this to humans, how could we prove it to rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I do not know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since human consciousness relies on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is punching on the nervous plane in so far as the same thing is judged in rats and in humans.
Since I do not explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I do not know if they exist.
It could be judged as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hit a wall.
I am an emotional pragmatist.
UEFA President Platini: Poland and Ukraine have a deadline of grace
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships,” Wasjunik said.
But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
In the timetable of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
“We cannot waste time anymore.
We must work at the maximum speed,” said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA is constantly watching us.”
An even more radical move has been decided in Poland.
The management of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The meeting was held at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act in accordance with the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP said.
“We have assured in a letter to the UEFA President that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer.”
Several members of the Premier League have already been convicted in the previous season for mandatory relegation manipulation; in the end, the start of the League has even been delayed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid outraged
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her private life in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan raised the veil on her ex-adulterant Dennis Quaid.
He foams - and counterattacks.
A late Rose War for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors engage in a disgraceful battle - at the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan said in an interview with the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have learned about the extent of the deceit only after the divorce.
The motive for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan’s press releases for his new film “The Women” – it tells the story of an adulteress.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her qualification as an unfaithful husband fell clear: it would be “Monstrous,” said the 54-year-old to “New York Daily News,” that “Meg once again removes the history of our relationship and manipulates it.”
It would be even more "regrettable" if "the pain and turmoil of divorce for every child were revived in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack.
While Ryan has lived alone since the divorce, Quaid has married again and will soon become the father of twins.
So was his response to the blow: “In any case, my life continues.
I feel happy to have a wonderful family that is at its best.”
Flight and hotel prices are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by financial and travel service provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and established, after price increases in the first quarter, a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, hotel nights have already dropped in many places.
From January to March, prices increased by an average of 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed, compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was sharp in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
The reasons for all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that led to a “diminishing desire for travel of American tourists.”
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices have risen by 26.3 percent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was rising in the first quarter:
As a result of the rising price of petroleum, passengers in the economy class paid an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while long-haul flights, which are very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the price of economy-class tickets dropped by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, business-class and first-class tickets, however, the price variations were largely less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter, they fell by 23.6 percent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reason for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, sluggish economic growth, the firm explains.
The demand would give way to many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure from the Open Skies Treaty which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Signs of the tense situation are the removal by airlines of non-profit flights, as well as the high number of airlines thatly filed the balance sheet during the first half of 2008 – they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV defeats Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has not yet managed to find a functional eleven.
By Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player came back late in the game and his raised shot failed against the goal frame.
His message was precisely formulated, it came out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He simply knew he was right.
“We need this second goal,” Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much happening in the dressing rooms, the half-time was over and most had settled in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that’s why his request was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acknowledged and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg coach Martin Jol.
Which orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
Implementation is missing.
"Everything wasn't very beautiful to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard “would have also wanted to be more relaxed.”
This 1:0 (1:0 in the middle), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful head stroke by Mladen Petric (in the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
“It was a dirty victory,” said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary this Monday.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the fans were celebrating themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as first in the class.
It will be a birthday without a celebration.
“We know how to take a step back,” said Marcell Jansen.
He doubts that the intermediate outcome of the chart reflects more the unpredictability of the Premier League than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late-engaged arrivals – Brazil’s Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as FC Bayern’s debilitated Jansen – is forming slowly, but it’s not shining yet.
“We need more charm and more dribbles,” Jol said.
After the failure of the vote
In Wall Street, there is fear.
The first news of the failure of the bailout plan temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in a single day in history.
Then the Dow Jones fell a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world’s largest stock index stood at 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers on the Dow Jones were on that date American Express, which lost 14 percent, and Bank of America, with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be profitable.
Goldman Sachs shares fell by almost 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the bailout plan, the funds must be mobilized for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgages.
However, the amount should not be paid in a single time, but gradually.
In return, the state should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged correlatively to the course of change in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
Aspirated stock prices in the turbine in Europe and the United States
Billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not meet the concerns of investors.
The price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax to the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones Index is falling despite the state-spoken bailout.
Dramatic falls in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The stock of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost at the moment three-quarters of its value despite the bailout operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has accused of a decline of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped significantly below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and stood next to 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with heavy losses.
Investors feared that the US government’s heavy $700 billion bailout plan might not be enough to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 percent in the first hour of opening.
The U.S. House of Representatives intended to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote is expected to follow on October 1.
Other European stock exchanges have also seen only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index has dropped by 3.2 percent for the moment, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743.61 points after a start-up rise of 1.26 percent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index dropped from 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.

In the MDAX, Arcandor shares fell after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The company also said that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" has been flying into space.
Because of fuel pipelines soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens it.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers – the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre by space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, Earth for example.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The US-European Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physical trick, just like the solar probe Ulysses.
That’s what has surprised researchers for years: Flying objects don’t always behave 100 percent as expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
There are also irregularities in the speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the abnormality of gravitational support using what is called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
“Dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near Earth,” he wrote.
Space researchers have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emits from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists’ calculations, dark matter would still make up a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists Abducted in Egypt Are Free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting before the release, six hostages were killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom are already underway.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE outlines the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This was by Egyptian state television, the Arab television channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after bulletins from Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian, along with their eight Egyptian escorts, are well and safe, Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released remain unclear: thus, the kidnappers would have been close to ending the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without screaming station.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to a ransom," the officer said.
It was only to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers shot six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostages had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily El Masri El Jom that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men had to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the incident.
Abuse of a father-in-law ‘leads to suicide’
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight heads of charges for ways of indecent facts.
Truro's high court said he regularly bonded his daughter-in-law, Stephanie Randle, during her childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
Trerise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied and bandaged her before forcing her to sexual acts, while her mother was working at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer at National Trust, was haunted by abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had seemed “emotionally dead” since 2006 and had “lost all hope for life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she committed suicide by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter’s beautiful father who, by the way, had written a letter of confession that ended as follows: “I attacked and bandited her regularly.”
“I didn’t sexually abuse her.
“I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise, “You’re really weird as a fetish, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of 7.
“This unpleasant saga ended with the victim’s suicide.
And what’s even more surprising is that if she hadn’t done that, her story would never have ended in court.”
He added: “I emphasize in particular, as described by her father and mother, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stephanie.
"Without them, she would probably be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who forgot top secret documents on a train in June will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The defense ministry man was on the go when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train toward Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious conviction of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of people from Whitehall.
"They would have thought that this matter would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defense and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed is accused of violating section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the custody of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Secret Service Associate Committee.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda as well as security forces resources in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret location.
Building companies in front of the B&B bill.
British construction companies may have to pay a bill of more than £80 million to cover the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingleys’ 2.6 million savers.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money from the savers, including 59 building companies.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it’s “irritating” to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots.
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are settled.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be charged, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that all 59 companies in the building are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have been prudent... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, general director of the building companies trade committee, told the BBC that the decision seemed unfair to him.
It’s “irritating” to see that institutions that behaved cautiously during the real estate market recovery now have to pay for institutions that are much less cautious.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945.
“We need to examine all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess options to take to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt bill,” Cole said.
Interest rates for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the whole year, which could also be doubled.
Since building companies are non-actionary organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk costs up to five pennies per liter.
People in Jersey have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, from five pennies per liter, starting Monday.
This is the second price increase following a two-penny increase in February, and comes as a result of a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide whether they will, in turn, raise the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been varied for the last time, in 2002.
Former PM in Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request for former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who thus risks being arrested upon his return to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her bail because she was charged with blackmailing a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) when she was PM.
This is one of many accusations against him.
Khaleda Zia, Sheikh Hasina’s old rival, was released under caution earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh in a few weeks, but his party, the League Awani, has demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release are contradictory because if she is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why she could not remain free when she returned to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
“The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s application saying it did not require a bail as she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons,” said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
“We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court.”
Her lawyers argued that she needed the bail to return to the country in order to prepare for elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after October 17, a former Awami party leader said.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the allegations.
The fight against polio in Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan, 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to violence linked to the Taliban, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
But she says she has failed to contact children from the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite Taliban promises not to attack or block thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses ITV’s legal battle
BSkyB lost its trial following a ruling by the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its stake in its rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB’s participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB acquired its shares in 2006 following an agreement in effect to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Bureau of Fair Trading that BSkyB’s purchase of ITV shares had raised doubts about ITV’s actual independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate.
Virgin CEO Richard Branson, a consumer group and regulator Ofcom were all opposed to the purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its ITV shares would be unreasonable and, on the contrary, excessive – especially given that BSkyB has just given up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the issue of the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole came from the report of the case of the inspector-general of the Justice Department, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the argument of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers questioned during the investigation lied to investigators, hindering justice.
"Serious allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began in December 2006 with the removal of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that prosecutors were fired because of poor benefits.
But it emerged later, that dismissed prosecutors were not more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute to these dismissals a political connotation.
Some of the prosecutors have been accused of being close to Congressional Republicans, while others have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and prosecuting lawsuits for the government.
It is certain that they can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and eventually resigned.
Several ministerial officials from the Justice Department have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him "first responsible" for these redundancies, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role," remarkably successful in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officials, including former Bush associate Karl Rove, have been criticized for failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf should be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to receive this recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the hit album Meat Loaf released in 1977.
The award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection limited to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell definitely goes away from it.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a big voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was marketed in the UK as a single in 1979 and ranked 15th.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained in the English charts for nine years, and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf – or Marvin Lee Aday, his real name – has suffered from health problems in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a severe laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then a cyst was found in his vocal strings.
A dark street in the city, often forgotten, and may soon be for sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others merely functional.
And even some veteran taxis and longtime local residents don’t know how to go to Extra Place because they’ve never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street—not to be confused with Second Street—between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide to 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty passage rather than an active artery.
No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repack Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including longtime neighbors, have said they are enchanted by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets in the housing paddle.
But the Department of Conservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighborhood owners committees, representatives from the city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers the street to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No. 3.
"There are only a few spaces left belonging to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
“They could propose to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public.”
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install seats, some of which would be used by a café to which the builder would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay spokesman, said that while the company wants to exploit the street, that doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to be the owner.
“Avalon Bay’s primary interest is to re-look this abandoned sidewalk, and make it public,” she said, noting that it was the city that suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a spokeswoman for the Real Estate Conservation, confirmed that the city was willing to sell the street, further stressing that the agency’s mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical footprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named since 1802, when the legacy of the great farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has since remained abandoned.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, reopened at Extra Place; the street is more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia".
“This place was beautiful,” said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of bars, bars, posters, leaves and strings.”
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about East Village’s evolution to luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity—a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be snatched in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Extinction") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote, “Extra Place is a small narrow asshole, dark day and night, and delimited by the doors of a rusted iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week’s newspapers flying out along the dams.”
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs smoothly to the bottom of the street, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce beer bottle, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
A few passers said they rarely thought of Extra Place, and suggested its emphasis.
Mr. Field, on his part, said he thinks some unders estimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in dark, wet and disgusting places.”
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate’s position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California Studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as Good as You Think.
Attracting favors from Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s proposals on education are an interesting example of this.
Obama’s campaign emphasizes that “Afro-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students.”
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama’s education program supports, among many other subjects, “bilingual transitional education” for those who learn English.
However, the question that arises for Obama is whether his desire to bilingual education that advocates classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are mostly Hispanic, and low-income.
More than one-third of the students, many newcomers, study English.
Among CM1 students, 100% passed the 2008 State Math Examination, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-Language-Art exam
This incredible success was achieved thanks to a different ingredient than that promoted by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street is based on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capabilities and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, says Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, opposed to bilingual education, told me “we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him.”
“It works,” she observes, “it worked for us.”
Shouldn’t Mr. Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools that are mostly Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results of this school speak for themselves; but the education policies within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the forecast of Mr. Obama’s response.
Although he is in favour of immigrants learning English, Mr. Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemizing about the wording of English-language laws.
Instead, he said, “You have to make sure your child speaks Spanish.”
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than despise them or consider them insignificant.
Oil Price Decline Following New World Economic Worries
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday as people fear the bailout plan will fail to bring the economy back to life.
Oil futures operations fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange during the sale this morning.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 a barrel since Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After experiencing a rise of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of deep uncertainty in the financial markets.
Investors are once again concerned on Monday despite the deal on the bailout plan, the largest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis will be lasting.
In the very latest episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will buy the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frenetic negotiations this weekend, concluded with the bailout agreement, "seemingly failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not escape this contagion.
“When it comes to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the U.S. virus would spread globally and in China in particular.”
The bank's analysts lowered their forecasts for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowing economic growth, so were forced to lower by 20 percent, the forecast of oil and gas prices for 2009.
The second time was crucial for improving the team’s record.
After spending over the last eight seasons, more time than anyone else in the Shaun Ellis Jets uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was watching the second half, when the Jets turned a 0-0 into an explosion.
“I’ve never seen anything like this,” Ellis said.
The second half began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played under dark clouds.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor to an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds before the halftime.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
“He’s a mediocre player.”
“We communicate extremely well, despite what people think.”
While Favre and Coles played the catch, the defense beat the Cardinals quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens ball, could well be the most charming event.
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 advantage.
That was the best that the Jets could have scored in a time.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said “the second time or the third?”
When he was told both – the Jets dropped 21 undeniable points in the third half – Mangini said: “I can tell you that I liked the second half more than the third.
“A lot of things have been done in a short time.”
Gebrselassie rested, breaking his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved worthy of his title as the century’s best background rider, after breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie beat 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, played last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record in his superb career, during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, the 1600m marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing — exaggerated in today’s eyes — that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive mile average in 4 minutes and 43 seconds
Track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyan, converted into background runners, have contributed to the decrease of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he suffered from hip cramps two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
Obviously, the rest allowed him to remain bright, but not rotted.
“I’m so happy,” he told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I went back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the better."
He was accused – especially in Kenya, the African rival of Ethiopia – of having orchestrated his races too much, avoiding the world marathon stars, in fact relying on levers as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s capabilities as a backend rider.
On Sunday, Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the lead heads disappeared.
Just over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to break away from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, surprised everyone by winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing Games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving at her third marathon her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran using a skilled strategy, leaving the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to take a nice advantage, then overtaking them about 18miles and a half afterwards.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenya, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a City Apart, the Pride and the Trials of the Dark Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, bright and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first entirely black city to be integrated, Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do today."The city of five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and no prison."
It has become a pilgrimage town.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, which is held every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And in various ways, the city it describes—has become tourist thanks to its inclusion in the Florida Tourist Guide published by The Depression—era Federal Writers’ Project—is still a place apart.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was in the 1930s when Hurston told us that the rural black population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knowing us so little, does not know what he is losing."
Even if this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has in turn invoked an open dialogue on the topic of race, many here remain cautious of the foreign gaze.
“We are very cautious about how to tell the story,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a resident ever and the oldest parishioner in the city.
“It has to be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historic model of black power-taking as well as a community of 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of southern black rural culture—sometimes despised, other times acclaimed—reminiscent of the birth of American slavery.
That would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, whom everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialect-filled books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide turned this city, just at the exit of Route 17, into a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida, ending up in a chapter of dark history and human drama.
As bold as a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was subsequently split into several private sections.
“Crossing the road on the left,” she writes, “you’ll find the modern brown-and-white public school, with its gardens and those well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always cared for, though he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passers.”
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, re-marriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor was not so.
It wasn’t a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing the colorless songs performed by men who praised their beauty.
She added: “Some people didn’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered as a vivid and eccentric person, who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, on board a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wore pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed at her.
“People were always happy to see Zora,” he said.
But he added, swinging in his chair from the rear patio overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was baptized, that “she never stayed too long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in any tomb, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no big commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy it offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Officials in Orange County wanted to make a five-way highway pass through the city, to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, the main two-way street of the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made while Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among so many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over mixing races led hatred to the gates of the community.
“At that time, a bunch of white youths came and threw oranges or objects at the people sitting on the side,” Franklin said.
“A woman has died.”
They threw a straw from their car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville’s cohesion and weakened youth confidence.
“Black children used to be kissed—I remember—we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening,” said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins and chief director of the Eatonville Community Safeguard, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until the time when teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white - I mean there's a line of cultural demarcation here," said Melle Nathiri.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have created room for many other Zora Neale Hurston – black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, like her, armed with joyful self-confidence and lines of conduct such as: “How can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!”
It exceeds me.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began struggling to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best-seller, reintroduced her to the American canons.
The highway project came just at the time when Eatonville’s most famous girl had regained its appeal.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors see her as a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences this highway would have.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the council rejected the proposal for the highway.
"The fiasco of the five-way highway, extremely fast, a real civic pride," said Melle.
Melle Boyd summarized it all by stating that “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory over the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been classified as a historic city since 1998.
A mono-theme library (renamed of course Hurston) opened in 2006 on a magnificent Kennedy Boulevard, repaired.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a rainy summer day, as small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(There are 90 percent of black people now.)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things—such as the walls of the old church in Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields—are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a brave teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to regard Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but also proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or the police, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger, like the 11-year-old Alondra and Alexia Kenon, twins from Winter Park, they seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
“Most people, who pass through this area there, will think, ‘Oh, this city has nothing compared to others,’” Alondra Kenon said after the Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it’s a very beautiful city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking fluently about finance.
Nevertheless, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosk and giant TV screens at Times Square, they’t realize they’re in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee nest offices above their top, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, are spending the worst “office day” since the 1929 crack.
Deliveries continue to sneak out on the sidewalks, with their chariots and muffins plates for morning meetings.
Latinos still drag between the residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging on a yoke disposed on his shoulders.
Office employees continue to wait to buy their morning sandwiches from walking merchants, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between 4 a.m. and 7 p.m. a week.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to go open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I found out at my local J.P. Morgan Chase subsidiary, about twenty people in line.
Not in front of the box office, nor to withdraw cash or make a payment, but in front of the customer service box, where regular customers ordered their checks, tourists asked for the direction for the Macy store, and new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my “authorized personal banker,” were all in line for the same reason as me.
Not in the same way, as they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that only operate in one state, and who say they treat customers like their family.
In the past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a $327 bank with capital, has resorted to bankruptcy, and as New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential disaster, have transferred their money to a bank they think is reliable, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Any New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
“I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its thin CEO Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she could have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge in my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries from my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank: “I put all my savings in the money market.
“I have changed, I don’t want to take any risks.”
Muslim tombs profaned while Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who has abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of "cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They wear road signs illustrating mosques stripped in red.
Police accuse far-right extremists of profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the weekend after far-right political parties won the country’s general election.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning, according to police, it is an organized action.
Criminals have painted Jewish symbols on several tombs, such as the Star of David; however, detectives believe this could have been done to disguise extremist hatred of Muslim immigrants.
This incident may have something to do with the election.
A spokeswoman for the local Islamic community said it was "deeply shocked" by the announcement of this profanation, which occurs just during the religious month of Ramadan.
Austria is seriously thinking about recovering its courage, following its oscillation to the right in the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two far-right parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which won almost 30 percent of the vote, conducted an anti-immigration campaign.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, conducted his campaign against wearing shirt and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of “a European brotherhood” to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the election defined the far right as the country’s strongest political block, as demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they were concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter banned from traveling abroad.
The courts banned glamour rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation to France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed to the authorities that have it under control, his intention to travel to Spain through France.
Police in Kent granted the travel ban last Thursday after proving to magistrates that Glitter was guilty of child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing at Ashford's limited jurisdiction courts, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford court, Kent police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling to France and Spain until March 25.
“Paul Gadd wasn’t there then.”
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, despite being listed on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could be sentenced to up to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss particular cases or potential movements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: “The Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children like those abroad.
“In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more efficient way.
“Protecting the inhabitants of Kent is the most precious intention to the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behavior of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he said he didn’t feel well and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from passport control, and eventually he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities denied him entry into their territory, and he was forced to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge, West London, limited jurisdiction court for him on the list of people accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to a four-month sentence in the UK for holding images of child abuse.
An interior ministry source said Interior Minister Jacqui Smith was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the stage to capture elements of his character." - Günther Bauer - Photographer
No clothes, no other clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other is the person.
They are inseparable except in the intimacy, in those moments unknown to the general public, where intimate gestures and stolen gaze are discovered by artists who don’t care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer blends in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few stages with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the peculiar iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Month of Flemish Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, growing every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "can be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed “on the street” are artists able to convey on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists, you don’t have to take pictures on stage.
They have a personality and character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality moments of the flamenco stars.”
With the "Cant populaire des Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, reminds of classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
It’s not about dance or singing in itself, but about the artist’s personality and character that captivates the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and magic has been the constant of this work that is presented these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy photographed artists.
The project has transformed into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a collection book of portraits displayed in the gallery.
Bauer’s passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the “Portraits of old sportsmen” (“SportARTproject”).
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing people's portraits, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In photography, portrait is the most difficult kind.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don’t know or who leave you just a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco entitled "Flamenco - people" is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of Rua de la Mata (route parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16 next year.
Vargas Llosa says his novel is “true”
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown topics, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project he is working on, a novel that has the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and who passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner confessed at the Hay Segovia festival yesterday that the novel currently occupying him "is a real boldness" and that "everything shows that he shouldn't write it."
"If I were reasonable, I would not do it, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival prize with the majority of votes of the participants, made full room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The Festival host, Félix Romeo, was faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical manner" through an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to cope with his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, a temporary experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less like," because writers were asked "not to let go of frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
Bad weather ruins the Pozoblanco Fair
The banderilles party that closed the bull races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after horseback towerers checked that the arena was impractical.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather has been harsh on this fair, since in the end two of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the celebration of the planned second bull race.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have faced in the arena of Castilblanco.
Only Friday’s celebration took place.
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after making arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered steps applauded more than his struggle in itself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without trouble or glory.
During his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whispered by most of the public.
Police control of a van in Alava province: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours less ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a truck and the last two take the run.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, of which to stop them.
Police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information disclosed by the Basque Government's Department of the Interior.
The suspect was charged with drug trafficking and falsification of documents.
The incident occurred when various officials of the Traffic Unit of Alava were conducting a vehicle check on the N-1, on the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
Police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometers further on the bottom side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a forested area.
Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish ballots. Then they transferred it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with that written on the gray card of the truck, which is also why they charged the detainee with a crime of falsification of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old detainee, A. A. J., has been detained to carry out the various actions and will be tried in the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the television series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the effect of a drug.
A witness saw her perform strange manoeuvres while trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, a spokesman for the California police patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that around 4:30 p.m. Locklear was "pushing the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and walking back several times, she drove on her sunglasses."
Shortly after, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and got out of her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency services because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why agents took her to the drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress proved cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the outset, although "according to the observation of police officers at first glance, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and was imprisoned around 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left the Arizona clinic where she was admitted to treat her nervous depression.
Llamazares has asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The coordinator general and deputy of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to make a decision on the case of the former Counselor of Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing favourable treatments to members of his family.
"In those cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities," Llamazares said regarding the behavior of the political party that he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the United Left asked that the investigations prove "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has “very strict ethical codes for all officials.”
“Blood of May” by Garci
Inspired by the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreated the famous battle of the Spaniards against the French in "Blood of May", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of 15 million euros.
The filmmaker tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour film, “Blood of May,” will be released in theaters next Friday, which will then become a more than four-hour television series for Telemadrid.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that he has realized with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to film a commemorative film for the two hundred years of the 2 May Madrid, something he always accepted when the story stood to national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Municipality of Madrid constitute for Garci a “unique opportunity” to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of “a Spain that mistakenly led the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions under Ferdinand VII,” he said.
But the filmmaker regrets not having obtained funding as for the films “Captain Alatriste” or “The Ghosts of Goya” – more than twice as much as he obtained for “Blood of Maio” – because he was unable to shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" has influenced his usual way of working, on the staging of actors, with whom he is used to repeat before starting the shooting and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to stay informed".
Many actors in "Blood of May" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four-time Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Academy of Hollywood, “Blood of Mayo,” “Seven French Billboard Tables” and finally the winner, “The Blind Sunshine,” are not representative of young Spanish cinema, “which deserves to be better known,” he said.
With this film Garci does not expect a price.
“At first you think you’re working for the offspring, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and now you’re content to make one more movie,” Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón takes on the role of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Dancer of Seville will pay tribute to a Dancer of Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana and who at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to play the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible.”
According to the dancer, “we’re not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The title of his dances reminded me of flamenco.
Thus, “the butterfly dance” reminded me of a Cuban folk dance and “the serpent dance” of some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as his,” she says.
The set-up was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done in "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his student.
Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I’m happy because she agreed to play a role in my work and that honors me.”
The stage was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this genre of artists who were considered dives".
This work also tells, in a certain way, the life of this woman who exhibited in places so far away, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows or appreciates her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a recently married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a Newly Married Poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York City, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the re-release of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Pearl of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the different Andalusian provinces, will go to New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a recently married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Less Like Without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice", and well illustrates the desperation of American cinema, and all of America, facing the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
It was hard to get an Oscar.
He has not been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a tough blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country have been better thanks to its existence."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightened, the appreciation of Americans has fallen very low, desperately looking for reasons for dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is only admiration left to human beings, and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He embodied for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the advocate of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs established in honor of his elder who died from an overdose and the creation of his own organic food brand.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This widespread wave of admiration swept through Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, has found that no James Bond has died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us the bar high," observed George Clooney, who is the only one today who tries to break the screen like Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and away from goals.
This is still not easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he remained faithful even though the opportunities were not lacking for him to not be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my home, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly witnesses the encounter of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he has played, he has never been so proud as the devout husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the race to host the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can host the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, that could come true in 2016.
I wonder if we are ready.
If we take the example of yesterday’s race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I’ve ever participated in.
If they had taken into account all the mistakes that occurred during the race, they would be subject to an elimination note.
But let’s look at it in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of the dossards, which forces you to go there in advance.
That’s not bad but if they get you moving it would be better that they give you everything (including the electronic chip for shopping).
and no
They made you go there only to take the backpack (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long wait line) surprise!, there was only the 'S' size for the shirt (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small-size shirts with less fabric and in turn cheaper?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Aside from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the wait line is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible given that 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long wait row, the competitions started and we hadn’t left our backpack at the entrance yet, though once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the waiting of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I think about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even appear in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not mark the start correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it’t come to mind.
So I believe we will always be able to dream of being the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist
At MIT’s Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move through the company’s campus) in response to what was asked during a conversation.
Through a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this “receptionist” can know how many people are in the place, who they are – including remembering what positions they occupy – and listening and hearing the keywords of their conversations.
They are also grouped into group conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but she understands that she is not part of the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks if she’s here to visit someone and she says she’ll answer him in a few moments.
All without a blue screen.
It is impressive.
But of course that represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, such as the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change in Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with essential things instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not ceased to add features and “extra” to Windows.
Change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome was the first step by Google to compete with Windows.
Many people have rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary since it is the indispensable basis for computer hardware and software to understand each other.
He holds the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear but we must see the “death” of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome, and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, more busy, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I’ll give you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the restrooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a poster asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search.Our future".
A 2006 study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009, but at the end of 2009.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
After all, the phone is becoming more and more like a computer.
But as the launch of Android is delayed and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them expensive.
The Great Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Diamond of Blood', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Father' and is part of the holding of the muscular gay association.
And if we start to list all of his appearances, we could also quote that moustachu that lifted weights in a walking circus.
It’s not just a simple men’s body shirt made of cotton, molding and without sleeves.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with the sport since it takes the name, according to the legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The ‘Marcel’ stands out from others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo, and the small (nearly recognizable) Belgian flag that the most famous body shirts have on the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweat shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
It is a pity to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't bother me"
His huge resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters are taking their new business in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they’re not just beautiful and famous girls who borrow their names.
She was present at the promotion that the brand Mango made in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you are doing in Paris.
I came here to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and myself created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera Dinner in honor of Valentino.
A very intense but at the same time exciting day awaits us.
What is your new Mango collection based on for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s fascinates us and we get a lot of inspiration from it for our collections.
I love walking around the city and watching women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you’re a very versatile woman, aren’t you?
I think yes, but in the end everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Ever since I was a kid I loved clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s closet to look in my aunt’s closet and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers love to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you wear the clothes it is at that moment that you really put yourself in the skin of the character.
From now on, everything is connected.
You had it not so long ago: was it hard for you?
not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s make me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, more experienced and enjoys life with fewer problems.
I am not afraid of the biological clock.
I did all the things I wanted to do since I was a kid and it gave me a lot of inner happiness.
Are you thinking of becoming a mother?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me for it and, moreover, I want to be a young mom; I don’t want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I am not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Go to the cinema, you wait for the different films you made last year to come out.
I’m looking forward to them coming out.
I am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course this is not possible.
I’m looking forward to the films ‘La última hora’ and ‘En busca de la tumba de Cristo’.
Let’s see what you think about it...
A few days ago you started on the gateway with Naomi Campbell, didn’t you?
Do not say that!
I didn’t go on the road to make the model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I’ve known her for a long time, to invite me to attend a charity parade in London for her women’s support association, and the clothes we exhibited – I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango – were auctioned to raise money for Naomi’s NGO.
The people that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
The good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear, I would have done it anyway.
We want to make the lives of women in the Third World better.
Alcoholic Drivers Should Install Alcoholic Driving System
The Minister of the Interior wants that the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcohol, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in the state of drunkenness, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced in June last year and now appears in the State Minister’s report in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its aim is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The State Minister responsible for road safety but also the General Directorate for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers who have been arrested for driving more than once in a drunken state, take the car again.
The Alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver’s alcohol level is higher than permitted.
It costs more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced offenses by up to 65% during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people each year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviors before they turn into criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal reform can be done by ordinary routes but, nevertheless, the reform done by criminal routes requires an organic law reform.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Exactly tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install in school buses this system as it has been done in France.
In Mexico without ‘peep-toes’
At 17:40 a.m., the aircraft of the Spanish Air Force in which the Princes of Asturias travelled landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico.
The sun was on the eve of sunset but its rays still compelled them to put their hand as a visor in order to see the royal couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I had asked on the street, the taxi driver, if he knew that the Spanish princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
“Oh, well, then we won’t be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... Are you from here or then...?
I’m Spanish, but I’ve lived here for two years.
Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
Several of them are waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military line of 27 naval soldiers.
The prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the princess, when she has hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing through the room where the official trial awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the city’s four largest hotels, a funny journalist from Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious fashion prize
There is no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was watching her models in the Mango vitrine at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost crying out of emotion.
It is the brand’s second largest store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of area.
The first store is in London.
The events, along with the desire to thank stylist Valentino, chairman of the jury of the contest, caused us to find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on the heart and making against bad fortune good heart, because of her brother’s recent death, Nati put on a Mango dress and some ELAH decorations, which cut the breath, and arm on, arm down with her son Luis – a beautiful man of almost two meters tall – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a suit because they had borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who introduced herself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner transformed herself by wearing a sexy, black long dress, moved when during the nightly tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and recalling the good old weather, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit to the dependencies of the palace, but she showed us before on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his linen, his towels and having asked in advance that there be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that is life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget about the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to crown it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The morning wake-up makes us almost sad when it rings every morning at 7 o’clock, but it’s even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm that the current life imposes on us.
The desk is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
One hundred, not one more, not one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods tailored to everyone's taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled “1001 Ways to Relax” and will come to bookstores directly from Pearson Alhambra and DK publishers.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain peace in places like work or through personal relationships, this ‘manual’ denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn’t run through your veins to restore your body’s balance and if stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect from his mind and focus on reading.
Speaking while sleeping
Some children talk at night.
I’m not referring to those who wake up very awake and tell us something that happened the day before, but to children who talk during their sleep.
The first time it happens, you may be surprised, but in reality it doesn’t matter.
This is a benign sleep disturbance called somnilochia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course, there are more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child remembers nothing.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (piping in bed) or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we said before, they can also be associated with very high fever, stressful situations or over-excitation.
This is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, whispers or, on the contrary, with screams, crying, long speeches ...
In the event that somnilochia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and in order to obtain an explanation for this problem.
We said it is a benign impairment, which is why there is no treatment unless it is related to another sleep impairment that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to bed.
Therefore, look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have trouble relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as somniloquies appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful Advice
Do not wake him up.
This is useless because he is unconscious and you would wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and then rests.
Remember that if it is shown to be very anxious several times, it is advisable to see a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), don’t be tempted to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because while sleeping, he is not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to how you will interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell a child that you can ask him during the night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don’t worry, this is nothing bad, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of disette.
Without making a big match, the Yellow and Black created the most opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the match.
The pace was not very supportive during this meeting where the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by the visitor captain Kauffmann, who spotted the lucarne on a long-range shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and turn by turn Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn above, Romain from the tip of the foot or Diebold came to catch the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were blocking in the middle of the pitch and just leaving Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was going to be decisive with first two occasions signed by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhusians by Marais, well positioned to retake a ball pushed back on a first attempt of Diebold (53th').
But the Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the dressing rooms a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose major problems to an Eleven Illinois who has just retreated a little to "compacter" his defense, except in the very last seconds of play where, after a large stumbling, the ball passed very close to the cross.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before heading to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of force by fishermen who severely disrupted access to several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning, to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come up with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the “crisis committee” created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of the hike in gasoline prices, which reached a record of more than 1.14 euros per liter on average.
Elysée spokesman David Martinon said the president "will discuss with them the solutions that can be conceived to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of sailors."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected firmly by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out shrimp operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing blockades of 10 km.
The recreational port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not stopped.
A filter dam has been set up on the peninsula of Quiberon.
The sailors already demonstrated their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel deposits in the ports of Brest and Lorient, while protests were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and the Channel, such as the Sands of Olone, in the Vendée, where the boat ships remained on the shore, or the Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the movements of commercial vessels.
Fishermen from La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges.
Those in Boulogne-sur-Mer have decided to wait for the meeting of the ministry on Wednesday to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and its participation in the interview scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials from the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "do not want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, the president of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay gasoline taxes, currently pay around 50 cents per liter, but they estimate that the profitability threshold of a boat is only reached with gasoline less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of cinema and the committed actor, Paul Newman, died at the age of 83.
Embraerins its 2008 delivery forecast
The Brazilian airline is expecting 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of a recession affecting the global economy.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, hasined its forecast of deliveries for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, said its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the airline delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer expects much from the Chinese market especially for its aircraft range ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG plans to sell more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have refunded, plans to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that has been advanced, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the case.
AIG’s board of directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible cessions, according to the FT.
No confirmation has been obtained from AIG.
The assets AIG is considering to separate include its air leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurance company Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT added.
No final decision has been made on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG has to quickly raise liquidity to repay the $85 billion loan the Federal Reserve has granted to it at the risk of the U.S. authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders.
History of the Morning Meeting History of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic fall on Monday following the rejection by the House of Representatives of the Paulson plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the trade resumption after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index fell 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (106.85 points), to 1.106,55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank rescue plan that was meant to restore some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives rejected Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's requested means.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market relied on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late."
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be quickly passed on to the Fed and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, Piegza stressed.
Following the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond fell to 3,632%, from 3,827% on Friday evening, and the 30-year bond to 4,161%, from 4,357% the day before.
Obama wins the first television duel
The first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates was followed by another to know who, John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that was allegedly followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, although honourable, has not been “brilliant enough” to allow him to halt his drop in polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released on Saturday gives Obama a five-point advance (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the indecisive voters, who are the ones that matter, Obama won for 39 percent of the polled, while 25 percent of them granted McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama is expected to be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his collier, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
She has good instincts," Bill Clinton said.
Seventy-year-old McCain has repeatedly highlighted his undisputed experience in foreign policy, while highlighting his opponent's "naivety" on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face meeting.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he has repeatedly accused.
“I don’t think Sen. Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
There has been an attack since yesterday on Republican TV ads.
Obama said he represents the future.
Without dismantling, he proved concise and precise.
He has highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has still not understood, while Obama, yes,” a Democratic spot replied this weekend blaming the Republican for not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the “street American.”
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina.
He has not even pronounced the words "middle class" or "workers"." The financial downturn clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by Americans as the most capable of saving the economy on the brink.
“The coming week could be a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democrat Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democrat candidate, the current debacle “is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would still be able to reduce taxes by 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street crashes, the Illinois senator also noted that achieving the country’s possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain has planned to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates were cautious, avoiding questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) bailout plan adopted by Congress last night and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “Have you noticed that there was an election, you?”
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday after the closure of the polling stations in the central Minsk square to protest the fraudulent character of the legislative elections.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign."
Some admit that they haven’t even voted, “What good, since they’ll do what they want with my voice,” says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has made good appearance to foreign observers in order to resume speech with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered proper by observers.
It was not according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not able to participate in the looting," Yuri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties, said.
“It’s a cosmetic change,” said Alexander Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the votes, and here it’s the executive power.
If opposition members enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "it is necessary to start the dialogue with the European Union.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
She emphasizes that the participation figures seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the voice to all manipulations.
“You noticed that there was an election, you?” asks Social Democrat leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, the ones that are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
The Blood Again Safe
Héma-Québec was celebrating the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has become one of the world’s safest and most effective blood suppliers.
And most importantly, it regained public confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, headed by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever was late to file his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and territories.
“In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec,” Dr. Decary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Thanks to efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” she said before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Decary keeps in mind that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its inception on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed in Europe the outbreak of many cases of the human form of the mad cow disease, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells the one that has held the fort since its foundation in 1998.
“And we didn’t know at all whether this disease could be transmitted through blood.
We then relyed on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when one does not know and a serious disease may result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are instituted.
In April 1999, people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980 were refused blood.
However, a few years ago, it was demonstrated without any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle applied makes sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: the nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to detect the presence of the virus itself directly in the blood of donors and not the presence of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have shortened the mute period, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors are infected without knowing and cannot be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that today one can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health,” says Héma-Québec’s chief executive.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than last year appeared on the island of Réunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant," continues Dr. Decary before stressing that in addition to a security supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for sufficient supply.
“The demands are increasing because the population is ageing.
As anti-cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which consists on average of only 3% of Quebecans eligible for blood donation.
Any healthy person aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country with malaria, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
“With these 3% we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
The shortages are very rare.
But members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but most importantly to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
With today’s life so busy, one rarely finds time to spend an hour donating blood,” says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye globules, and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to collect more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing for transplants early next year,” says Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood sampling program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact de Montréal qualified for the semi-final round of the eliminatory series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4-3 in total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, in the second and decisive match of the quarter-final series with total goals, at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a first half without goals on both sides, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other sets of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that in the first game of the go-to-return series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Whitecaps Vancouver in the semi-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return match to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless entered the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
The Victory of Kovalev
The Canadian number one trio is ready for the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 win of the Canadian at the dam shot against the Florida Panthers last night at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec scored two assists, and Kovalev scored a pass in this win, the fourth of Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to do too much in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
I think he liked the end of the game.
He had a great applause.”
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected on the occasion of today’s partial election.
"Removing the boundaries of our last large northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a kind of Moulin with images.
On three huge screens, spectacular clips of hydroelectric dam, mining, Quebec viewed by Google Maps, maps, etc. were circulating.
such as during the election period.
In a press release, the prime minister has refused to rule out that he would trigger the elections this autumn, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Nord Plan" is the fourth of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the prime minister’s recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory at the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is "a jewel with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
There are a few areas of what could be further developed: hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's enumeration.
This “territory twice as large as France”, “is at home, it’s in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he sought a national founding myth.
Quebec has built up a lot in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold struggle in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It is ours, it is our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said at the press conference.
“This is a traditional position that all governments have repeated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity comes, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
"With climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North," he said, speaking about the northwest passage, which will open all year long due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The prime minister said the government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-Pekistani MP from Ungava), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "we will give each other a common vision".
The development of the North would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly,” he said.
Jean Charest described this “vision” as being in continuity with that of liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central to Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future," Charest said.
As a press point, he invoked another, conservative reference, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper’s hydroelectric dam project, Mr Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"It remains between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his militants, provoking applause at home.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering a vote this fall, which the law allows him.
However, he stressed that his schedule is filled, including a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that passed like a letter to the post: the PLQ demands in particular the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they have a veto right on decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the large lines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with skepticism.
Pauline Marois, the leader of the country, promoted the North Quebec Development Policy initiated by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, gave up applying it.
If he did, "we would be more advanced today," Marois commented alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (the scrutiny that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the adoption of a Northern Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Posts Tagged: a disgraceful country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, a former minister of "Justice" (o irony) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
Thus throwing the reproach on this woman who has led an unceasing struggle for justice and who deserves all our admiration says as much about the prime minister’s surroundings as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are facing a government that is the only of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated its citizen imprisoned in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager at the time of the facts that are accused of him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, rejects its promise and lets a child soldier be crushed under inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the accused’s guilt.
Remember, UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that shuts its eyes on torture: it doesn’t care if a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, forever after so many years of exactions.
We don’t realize it yet, but we are witnessing at this time to an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that word that Harper continues to brand and sounds so hollow in his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: a Canadian citizen can be abused, tortured, arbitrarily imprisoned according to the goodwill of a government leader who was so far a minority (what then after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates virtue, law and order: they do not see that this government has given up what was the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
The Orwell Discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Chief Vice President of Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
Following Orwell’s logic, he claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a defamatory lawsuit for six million dollars against three authors and a small publishing house without the money in order to launch a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamatory prosecutions, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publisher of Black Canada will have to spend considerable sums of money to prepare their defense and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers backed by the bottomless pockets of the mine.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will shake up the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look again at the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her view of the facts.
Unlike in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually conducted through the exchange of ideas and not by bats.
So it was enough for the mine to open its books, its files, and set up a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support to Black Canada’s authors.
Per Mr. Garver could explain how he can both call for a “public” debate while contempting the opinions of that same audience?
In the vice president’s world, it seems that this word only refers to high-paying lawyers and not all Canadians; here’s a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports Black Canada’s authors and editors does so primarily because he rejects the brutal way of mining.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a bulldozer (continuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed an appeal to the authors of Black Canada urging them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, Barrick Gold’s pursuit is a direct attack on the freedom of academic research and the pursuit of truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, in whole, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that disagree to the wealthy companies of this world in a country like Canada, without repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, she could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
He has a right to replicate.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long known how to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the academic world, as is it for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place arrangements to limit this type of abusive prosecution.
Wall Street rescue operation: Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has shaken Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
It provides for: better control by elected members of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure reimbursement of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for non-payment, as well as a right to look at wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the markets,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
"Everything has been done in such a way as to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing Wall Street crisis," she said.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on American daily lives will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had turned to a sprint in recent hours due to fears of the effect a new failure would have on investors’ mood.
The deadline agreed was the opening of the markets this morning.
Associated with late negotiations, the two candidates in the US presidential election were rather favorable to the agreement, but nevertheless expressed their dissatisfaction that one was forced to get to this extreme.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has attributed the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including that aimed at allowing owners to keep their homes and that on the salary of executives of companies rescued by the state.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Asked on another channel if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope it does."
“The big lines I’ve read [show] that it’s something we’re all going to have to digest and with which we’re going to be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to redeem with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky, and unsold debts of U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the burst of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (subprimes) before spreading to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulting in a liquidity freeze and banking and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican-elected voters who overturned the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed to have come out of this impasse since the Democrats accepted that some of the "toxic" assets of companies in trouble are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added stating that if the government had to bear losses for five years with this program, it could set up new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first tranche of $250 billion to which another $100 billion may be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be approved by another congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the rescued companies that will pay him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to sell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing attached to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on remuneration and start-up allowances paid to executives of affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to vote in the House of Representatives today, and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will get the green light.
Votes have risen yesterday against the bill, both in the Republican and Democratic camp.
"Obviously, Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's finance committee, told voters.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
It’s not about benefiting taxpayers.”
Animating a small group in Congress nicknamed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to tell us: we are asking Congress not to rush and carefully consider the path to take,” he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again proof of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was renouncing to acquire its competitor in the midst of the shipwreck since it lost €2.9 billion in the U.S. mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurance companies.
“It’s not lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In exchange, you get back voting rights in the bank and influence.
It’s just something that savers and households appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank misled by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all current loans from the bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than $41 billion ($75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander has announced that it will buy the bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Icon Engaged
His beauty in the eyes of Azur has long been his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Did he get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the charming smiling American actor?
Yes and no.
His humility, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the record of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared Friday, at the age of 83, from a lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a sort of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American Dream.
Without excessive ego, the last mark of quality.
For in him a whole country was projected by the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama art at Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, television, and soon in the cinema.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second at the Le Mans 24 Hours in 1979, doubled with a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow zones of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the outbursts of the show business, whose mystery will not be completely solved.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has caused the cinematographers to dizzle this weekend, as his major roles on the black screen of memories intersect.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation wander through it.
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Tennessee Williams' 1958 adaptation The Cat on a Burning Roof.
Nearer to us (1990), it evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newman have gone into history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, resumed after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic villain in the brilliant The Sting (The Scam), Oscar for best film in 1973.
Bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he will take on the character on his return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him in 1987 his only Oscar with nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Again to him.
The periods pass through his course.
Young people know him mostly through the cultured Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him back in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen brothers.
With his last role as the patron of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Contrary to several film legends who left the profession early enough, Newman will have remained in the seat for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, fasts and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tender for the beautiful Paul Newman whose roles have long fallen into the bump.
He played, however, less often the early youths than the marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, wretched or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known facets of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, dedicated his 1984 film Harry and Son to him, a work of humility and sadness.
Amidst the rain of tribute that rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) affirmed, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrant traits of the missing actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he is also a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of Hollywood’s drifts.
We have seen a lot of his binette throne on pots of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, although gains at first.
However, the proceeds from these sales were paid to his Foundation for Difficult Children.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: “All the time and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And it is a privilege for us to have followed the path of such a lucid and generous American artist.
Citizenship in general and in general.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their facturing factory?
In the near future, on 8 October, hearing on the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, permanently and regularly, having caused significant damage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the money from subsidies was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, about 65 million HUF in total, went to the box office of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and some people’s pockets.
Their method, also made public by the authorities in charge of the investigation, was to raise the money from subsidies obtained by issuing bills of fees, behind which no actual service was provided and thus the associations never met their commitments.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were false.
For the latter, they obtained bill books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps at Kiskunhalas.
The names of companies to be included in the invoices were decided, inter alia, during the tour in the northern province of Lake Balaton, conducted by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to identify pensions and restaurants.
For his personal expenses, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among other things, to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András Őri, who, according to our information, was mainly concerned with drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "screening circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two bills issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice issued on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which subsequently will be named Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért, was full of form and substance errors.
One pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and a maximum of ten people could spend the night there.
Facturers with overwhelming imagination also fell into excess when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, which also belongs to the Horeca sector.In their accounting, neither Jobb Jövőért nor Hoppá’s name appeared, according to information given to the prosecutor’s office.
Győző Farkas, the company’s manager, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor’s office summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"Our company name and tax number were placed in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that according to the bill, a hundred people were staying there, did not fit either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have as much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time.”
The zealous bill issuers also did not inquire about Budapest’s travel agencies, as part of their choice, but only organized trips abroad.So, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on cash bills, which is also contrary to the agency’s accounting practices.
Furthermore, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT to these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate for the four invoices issued on behalf of the Hotel Révfülöp on the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company’s services do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT.
The prosecution's investigation reveals that the "emitents" also made mistakes by mentioning the transport of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, given that its profile was investment advice.
In addition, it is also for form defects, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued on the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI.
Just as in the case of the company Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sports stage, both of whom deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) when the Fiatal Városért Egyesület group was supposed to have a meal at their home.
Deliberately issued invoices
Another category of invoicers is that of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue fictitious invoices.
Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták group, issued an invoice to the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of the company Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no actual benefit was provided.
No financial movements took place, as the issued invoices were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies avoided mentioning this in their accounts.
The next category of invoice issuing companies is that of companies directly linked to the accused.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the CEO of the company Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles, whose headquarters was in Budapest, but where he was not found, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these equipment were acquired by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov had also delivered documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt to the Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he took their counter-value.
It was precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian Freemasons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In reality, none of these companies worked, which the accused explains by the fact that they did not receive work.
He used these companies, however, because at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as the writer of the founding acts of the companies, he issued invoices in their names, in the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the associations Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
Kubatov gave agencies a total of 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor believed that 10% of the amounts indicated on the bills and VAT went to Kubatov’s pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices that were used as part of Biztos Pont’s grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the socialist party’s public utility organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for a double amount of HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes stated in the application.
To prevent this from happening, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these bills were found during the search carried out in the office of Árpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
During the hearing, a part of the accused will report the method of making the invoices, as it had already done before the prosecutor’s office.
What could be really interesting would be that the chief accused, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the slightest details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if, eventually, the Socialists would have reached an agreement according to which in exchange for the refund of much of the fifty million HUF, Zusi would wear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is probably offended, since requests for his placement in custody, based on an easing of his conditions of detention, are continuously falling into the ear of a deaf.
While those who caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of irreparable economic crimes, walk freely or at least wait at their own home for the end of the procedure.
The psychology of overpricing: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have managed to update the neurological and economic foundations of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, humans don’t want to be distanced during this type of competition, such as an auction on eBay, and that’s why they even prefer to pay a too high price.
These researches have attempted to draw up a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (MRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain regions of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could win money, but during the auction of which an essential element is the overbidding of a third, the set located under the brain trunk, called the striatum, moved intensely when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the escape to the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economists members of this group of researchers conducted financial surveillance analyses.
In these, three groups overpriced against one partner, in various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they thus made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they went out winning the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received those $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money in case they lost the auction.
The difference between the two groups is that one group focused on victory, while the other group focused on failure.
Thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the player team "against failure" were willing to make higher bets than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
“These findings cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena seen at auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in the face of risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should I see a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
Hundreds of miles of patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary are estimated, but only seven miles follow treatment.
The term hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms.Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and engendered diseases differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (for example: contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travelers, it is recommended to get vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by general illness, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then a visible yellowing develops on the skin and the white of the eye, the stool becomes brighter and the urine takes a darker color.
Worldwide, one million people die each year from the most severe form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that according to estimates, only one in ten patients receive medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know if they have the virus, because the pathogenic gene deliberately destroys liver cells.In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination rate is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who underwent a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattooers.
Currently, 200 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis C.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your doctor as soon as you notice symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured if it is detected in time.The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
World Hepatitis Day is celebrated on September 30th, and was first organised in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does he who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would work as a kind of analgesic, which would already have helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
The British newspaper Telegraph published an article according to which researchers from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment by analyzing how much belief in God could influence human tolerance for pain.
As part of this least bizarre experiment, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the suffering.
Through a human brain palpation technique, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains responsible for regulating pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians from different sectors of the university participate.
Specifically, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electrochocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look sustainably at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with the hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci’s painting, not very different from the first, focused on its soothing effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an IRM scanner, and during that time, they received 20 electrochocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious-themed painting or the more general-themed painting.
Catholics said that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt like they were “safe,” like someone “careful” and they “calmed down, and peace invaded them.”
When they saw the religious-themed painting, they 12% less pain than when they watched Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided you find the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Tom Wright, the Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of these researches.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases it actually changes our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we show the believers a Madonna painted by Leonardo or by a painter of the same caliber?
Would the vision of a better Virgin Mary result in better results?
You are what you reveal about yourself.
On the occasion of its 10th anniversary, Google claims that you can find it at the bottom of people’s pockets as well as the sky above their heads. it knows where they spent their holidays, which specialists they consult and what their interests are.
However, this is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the most influential people in the society.
While with regard to the skeptics setting a parallel to Orwell’s horror vision, they don’t see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary ambition is to gather even more information about its users.This is necessary for Google’s founders to meet their original goal: “Gather all the information in the world in one system!”
According to the Google executive interviewed, after ten years of worldwide work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all information.
To the question: “What will happen in five years?” Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as “What can I do tomorrow?” or “What is the job that works best for me?” however, software will not be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, until the day they know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during internet searches, the IP address of the computer that initiates the search and the pages then viewed by interested persons are accurately listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can view what they have sought, what they have clicked on. Through this, in the long run, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us based on our previous statements and our recorded preferences.
What if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my job is? ask users, who worry seeing Google’s information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can arouse fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly revolt against power that can arouse a counter-reaction among internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the searched terms are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are passed on to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Internet users concerned about human rights were able to blow a breath of relief last May, when Google, hand-on-hand with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right to the court before the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had won over the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier.
Google’s judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is beaten down by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer from it when they begin to use Google services.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its “wilds” bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users that appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the “affiliated corporation”, as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as the world invader because of Windows, even though they both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification codes, does not ask for money for its applications.The document code and program package, constantly refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, compared to the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between human rights and the internet, and what the web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, the web 2.0 is nothing more than collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication made available to us, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person can generally keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his music habits. Then he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically display their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While one can take note of many examples, such as the girlfriend who easily understands in sight the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the company who fired one of his employees, only for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about the top management, one can be on one thing: the term privacy is totally to reconsider these days.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows about himself, and this is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behavior of today’s youth.
Who wants to hide something, or at least wants to try to bypass the monopoly of Google, can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, deliberately leaving no trace).
The number of people who, deliberately, do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them, is not the least. Google's online services, from text processing to image processing, to reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed until today.
The public is waiting, without really hiding it, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars). AdWords/AdSense advertising domains are threatening advertising agencies’ revenue, while increasing services are causing serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other software developers.
However, critical observers find, alongside all this, contradictions with disturbing effects: for example, the company’s top management has rejected, in its entirety, the employees’ protests, after it has doubled the price of the corporate nursery and after the company has found too expensive daily multi-restauration, taken at any time.
According to one of the company’s internal rules, new services are not announced until when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google’s project to scan and archive books and magazines takes such significant dimensions that the company will soon face the U.S. Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in it we can build a full medical profit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction authors. The famous Cory Doctorow novel, written with Orwell's half-tones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way only through Google's data.
Two miners helped to disappear the traces of the double murder of Ózd
"The police have summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double murder of Ózd. Based on well-founded suspicions, they helped to make the traces of the crime disappear," - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the facts they are accused of, for now, complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, are defending themselves freely.
Complicity in murder can result in imprisonment up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old young man from the corner, was placed in detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premeditation and by interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and it is for this reason that he dragged his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the boy’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to information from the MTI, the young man premeditated his crime.The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden on the crime site is proof of this.
Police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange proposes to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered 200 million euros (about five billion Czech crowns) to buy 100% of the stock of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Poles made despite the fact that the Czechs previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate itself from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the proposal of the Poles represents the highest bid to date for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer so far.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new worst owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion CZK.
Based on an agreement between the shareholders, about 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance, with approximately 25 percent stake, followed by 14.7 percent bank Ceská Sporitelna and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the international financial crisis, worsening from day to day, the leading European press newspapers already refer to a "second September 11".
“The global financial catastrophe is due to the American president,” accuses the Roma daily, La Repubblica. “The president has not even been able to block with his own party behind an improvised bill aimed at relieving a desperate situation...”
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, as billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
A portion of the Madrid press also sees the emissary goat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the global economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world will pay the price.
Bush’s plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress vote, a real danger threatens, the one that Washington does not offer a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the void, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer, stresses the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still give a baffle to their hesitant financial institutions, and with the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial means nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to do little of their national egoism, and to centralize control over divided financial markets.
Only on Monday, weakened financial institutions received more than €100 billion, the Viennese daily Der Standard recalled, adding that fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands in the pocket, very deeply, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis are becoming more and more realistic.
Until now, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, passes, part by part, through the old continent.
The “saviors” shouldn’t immediately pay a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch the taxpayer’s money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the burgundy
Which method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle than the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
As for example, the bees.
In the stunning project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the whirling bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic starting point to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini-robot car, a bio-inspired robotic self-control system, type BR23C, which it equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flight, each bee constitutes its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks a lot like our secure protective shell,” explained Kazuhhiro Doi, director of the brand’s research and development and technological public relations department.
The face-faced eye of the bee plays a primary role, as it is able to see in all directions, at a angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, engineers approached the idea of a laser telemetry.
It identifies obstacles at a 180-degree angle and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a avoidance manoeuvre.
The perception of the obstacle occurs in a fraction of a second.Then the mini auto robot, mimicking the bee's movements, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system at present, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it wasn’t, the mini car robot’t be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for now the collision is considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place at a glance.
Unlike bees, the difference can not go up, down, or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotational movement, acceleration as well as slowing as manoeuvres available to the mini auto robot.
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a greater energy concentrate, which makes their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is instinctive intelligent response that is primary, not data processing, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres.
We do not need a memory capacity of gigabytes, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards designing a technology for instantaneous avoidance.Nissan estimates that this system will be introduced in mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination while avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave a name to the baby out of price
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, which aims to redeem banks’ dubious loans, and use them repeatedly, is ready.
In the first round, half of that amount will be spent.
During new discussions lasting until after midnight on Saturday, East Coast local time, congressional leaders agreed on the controversy over the $700 billion bailout plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, according to which it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in commenting on the compromise’s results that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m. local Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2 p.m. local Central European time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill corresponding to the name of Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of the Year 2008.
On Saturday evening, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the deal.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
Moreover, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which mentioned that the $700 billion should be spent at once, for the repurchase of securities involving dubious credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion sum can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the law has been passed by Congress, probably Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to buy dubious loans from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President’s discretion.
The program will be supervised by an independent body, in which the Chairman of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The second half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to set up a combined strategy: it will be able, at the same time, to buy dubious debt, mortgage and dubious mortgage securities, as well as other types of "toxic" debt.
Ministry officials said the purchases could take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to participate in an insurance program, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to predictable damages.
Henry Paulson said the law provides the tools needed to devote $700 billion to the financial system’s urgent needs, whether it’s large-scale repurchasing, insuring, or avoiding the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or another major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary measures, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank executives who are in bad positions and waiting for state aid can expect their starting compensation, simply called the overseas golden parachute, to be ceased by the government.
The salary ceiling is mentioned only in specific cases.In addition, the limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The ceiling principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys as part of an auction, they will levy a surplus tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank chairman retires.
Immediately after the repurchase of questionable debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not exaggerated.
In order for the picture to be complete, it must still be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The ceiling applies only to new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in U.S. history that legal ceilings will be in place on the appointments of general directors, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Committee on Financial Services.
In addition, the state provides itself with a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan.In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even be winning in the business as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall back on their feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will decide on how losses will be reimbursed to taxpayers, starting from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were obviously those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
It’s not for this reason that American citizens have mandated us, this doesn’t protect taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who press the action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher levels of prices for plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the product and chemical manufacturing sector (1,6 percent).
The deflation resulted in oil processing (1,4 percent), machinery and electrical appliance manufacturing (0.9 percent), as well as a minimal increase in wood processing (0.1 percent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
Other sectors of the processing industry registered an increase, ranging from 0.2 percent to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant weight in the national industrial exploitation, prices suffered a 0.3 percent rise in August, mainly due to the effect of the rise in gas price imposed by the authorities since July 1.
In a twelve-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, it was the oil processing sector that experienced the most significant increase (32.4 percent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices increased by 13.2 percent, while in the important food, beverage and tobacco production sector, prices increased by 11 percent.

In the sectors of consumer goods production, prices increased by 0.3 percent, while those in the sectors of energy and materials for subsequent processing saw no change compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the most significant increase was observed in the sectors of production of energy and materials for subsequent processing (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 percent, while in the profit-initiating sectors, a 1.4 percent decrease.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector, in HUF, increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 percent over 12 months.
Within a month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 percent against the euro, and by 7.1 percent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 percent against the euro and 15.9 percent against the dollar.
Will I still need a visa to travel to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz believes there are good chances for the U.S.-Hungarian visa-exemption agreement to enter into force on January 12.This is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on the time when the overseas electronic entry and control systems will be put into service."
Every time, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister will hold talks in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of the presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, assured their support for the government’s $700 billion bailout plan.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives in Congress and the Administration finally announced, Sunday morning, that they have concluded principled agreements on the bank rescue plan.
This funding plan, aimed at unlocking the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the highlighting of economic issues, Obama has once again managed to get a bit of advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a collier just after the Republican convention, has melted.
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress will quickly pass the bill on the $700 billion bailout.
He stressed that the proposal contains the consumer protection passages he also supports.
“It is now that we must act responsibly... a danger threatens your jobs, your economies, entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy,” he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He called McCain’s economic ideas outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: “We will all have trouble swallowing it... but doing nothing is not a possible way.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the ceiling on departure allowances for senior leaders, and that he was, personally, very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantial role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Representative House chairwoman Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press Release of the German Language Territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is what Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of the Red and Black.
by Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades, and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of times is at the same time the problem of the whole Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the failure was not entirely a surprise, but on Sunday, a process that was likely just ten years ago came to an end: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU was up with 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the level of 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devoring its parents", consistently implemented in the region by the CSU.
Sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been deeply mistaken about the rhythm. However, secularization, educational outcomes and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks, it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as independent workers, craftsmen, baccalaureate holders and graduates.
In these groups, support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.

In its article entitled “Who?With Whom? Party leaders stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues,” the Austrian Conservative daily deals with the confusing domestic policy situation that settled after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian SPÖ Socialists want to discuss with the ÖVP Conservatives.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from meddling in its internal affairs.
The populist BZÖ party is open to negotiations.The Greens do not want to agree on the coalition yet.
Elections have taken place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates held on public television, party leaders barely let their cards be seen.
Werner Faymann, the SPÖ president, has confirmed that he wants to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible – that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question of whether he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as deputy chancellor, remains open on Faymann’s part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the proposals of the Red.
As he has already said, a collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or joining the coalition is temporarily a completely open issue.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to any proposals.
"To avoid the red and black coalition, we are ready to assume governmental responsibilities," Haider said.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, as representative of the current Presidency of the European Union, began in Paris.
In her message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokesmen of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People’s Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that affects the most Roma children and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to participate in the consultation are European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil society organisations, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz People’s Party member group, Járóka warned that besides the distinctions found during hiring, Roma are disappearing from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
“The overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have a secondary degree, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a small fraction have the opportunity to obtain a graduate degree.”
In addition, Járóka insisted that education as an elementary human right plays a key role in ensuring other fundamental rights.
Investing in early childhood education for Roma children means strengthening the economies of the EU member countries.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, including among Roma and non-Roma.
Indeed, the sooner a Roma child starts school, the more likely he or she is to become a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his or her income and consumption, he or she participates in the state budget.
"Because of their European Union citizenship, Roma must be assured of their right to quality education, and be protected from low-quality and sectarian education," - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, a goal-oriented and action-oriented European Union collaboration is necessary for an immediate acceleration of the school segregation process.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children so that they can participate as full-fledged citizens in the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
In the name of the “European Year for Equal Opportunities” assured for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, held annually since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: the grace for a transition period
In October, the decision on the fate of the broken duo Huber-Beckstein will be made.
Despite this deplorable election failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The party’s president, Erwin Hube, and regional government chief, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their seats.
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic vote loss of 17 percent, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party congress, held on the last weekend of October.
Members of this highly criticized couple have, in any case, made the feeling that they did not specially stand in their seat.
Thanks to this, they engaged in calming the angry members of the fraction and the base, who one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago — it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, at the peak of his career — the socio-Christian union gained 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, there is only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, the CSU has been Bavaria’s “only sovereign” contributing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, of key importance for the Hungarian economy.
As one of the early signs of an internal reorganization of the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, presented as the possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tacit discussions with the FDP liberals, as well as with the Right-wing Free Electors, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the Free Electors list, Gabriele Pauli, whose measure against Stroiber served as a possibility of a coup perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, went into legislation, and then treated the very ambitious municipal politician with relentlessness.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy into stabilizing Beckstein in one way or another.
In this transition, Stoiber, who has so far been pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role.The former head of regional government and former CSU president has designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some fierce remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and also to Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to be chancellor again if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, which played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hardly hiding her disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of terrain of the CSU will not negatively influence the large coalition in Berlin.
This is relative, however, because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the social-democratic crisis continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MPs entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to irregularities committed during voting.
The OSCE, which has 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-member legislature in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been very well opposed for decades, before yesterday’s elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time in questionable elections, in the wake of the 2006 constitutional amendment, would “allow” this time the presence of a few opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way, the OSCE abandoned its initially planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, economically increasingly dependent on Russia, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian political order called antidemocratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take a credit because of the decline in Russian natural gas imports, increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas pipelines crossing the country, went into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, referred to a preliminary calm.
However, the OSCE statement on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the majority of opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when votes were drawn.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a tangible improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia separated from Georgia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevitch told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this remains the case, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament that has no weight, to get even one opponent in."
The opposition does not plan protests in view of the results, but instead tries to convey its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on that side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, local authorities are putting sticks in our wheels for what is broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting elections, even in the circle of the elderly," Milinkevitch said, referring to the fact that in Lukashenko's current regime, which considers social security as its main outcome, the most supported layer of pensioners officially no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'remembering the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevitch said.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds."
Brunetta: “From today, breakfast before work.”
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, we had turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today, this new measure is in effect against the little smarts, against whom he points and then drinks the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for working better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
Now begins a new season of responsibility and transparency.
“This is reformism,” Brunetta said.
The installation in all the premises of the Council Presidency is complemented by the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, “the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance from the employees was recorded, the secretary-general assures: "This is a process shared by the employees, and we have had the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or growing.
Brunetta’s promise, which suggests smiling, “a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution.”
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister communicates that “in three months, the sick absences of public employees have decreased by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in a year.”
He added that it is essential to make public administration more efficient.
Italian, "including wage dynamics," explains the minister, "the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and in addition inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees united to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service today spreads the data on the decline in absence at work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the population of ‘active fainting’ continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive public administration employees have gathered together to declare war on the illegitimate standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional benefits in case of disability due to service is disputed; the extension of the hours of the home stay of the sick worker, during which the control visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions wished by the minister.
Accidents at Work, Napolitano: "Critical Prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work accidents, 3 deaths and 27 people who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were about 1,200.
These figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon, which remains one of the leading causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To bring the attention of institutions, social forces and the media to this dramatic aspect, the Anmil celebrates today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Occupational Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
“The disturbing data released by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace,” said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Work Disabled, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his “sincer appreciation for the ongoing associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of accidental workers, the assistance to the families of victims and the awareness-raising of the public opinion.”
Naturally indignated, everyone has struck the fist to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the participation of the public opinion, even if the everyday reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, House President Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social urgency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly."
The workplace accident data appears to signal a slightly positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths from being impressive," said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
We do not wish that this “discounting tendency” actually translates into less attention, for it is precisely when attention is relaxed that tragedy occurs.
“We believe that in general, we are not doing enough to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions.”
“According to us, more checks and inspections are needed, as well as a greater intervention on the training of workers, and this, from school.”
He added, “We need to make more efforts in terms of communication and public awareness.
"But above all, we need a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work" and the "assistance derivative towards which the system has been oriented in recent years".
“The goal, therefore, is to restore the worker the guarantee of insurance – he added – so that the fate of the one who has an accident, must not depend on spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislator.”
MP3 player pointing the finger, they put hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a statement released in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
The study found that 5-10% of those who listen to full-volume music using portable music devices for at least 5 years, for more than an hour a day and a week, are at risk of permanent hearing loss.
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“According to scientific data, this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In addition, we need to review existing control systems in view of the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can keep up with new technologies.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable music devices and the increasing number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
Scientists confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with Member States and other stakeholders what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
This data can be greatly limited by using solutions such as reducing noise exposure levels and duration.
The EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to music at full volume (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, are exceeding the current limits on the maximum permitted noise level at work.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for prolonged periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing ability after 5 years.
This interests 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission for the future of the capital to leave.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the money.
This is the schedule set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new headquarters, behind the Thermas of Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 components of the Commission will develop the directives for Rome.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the “official stamp” of the Capitol and its Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
“The commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there – Alemanno wants to emphasize – it will have to propose ideas for Rome’s development which will be used by the political decision makers, who remain the Committee and the Municipal Council.
No overlapping of roles, but only the will to have a corner where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March, she will finish her tasks and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise duration.
In June – announced by the mayor – we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale.”
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Politics is too often overwhelmed by the management of everyday life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look forward, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
Moreover, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that “this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Roman citizens, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "it takes a draft of strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a united spirit, ".
A future that, said the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but that will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also "in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama is the first anti-American president.
A famous American politician who wants to pretend to be independent wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on the part of his decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: “This person is full of ambition.”
Obama is really dumb: he believes he will win the highest position in a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president?
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern United States wrote an article: Once in the polling station, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
Here comes an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say whatever you want, we will see ourselves put the cross on either Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, so much that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all this reasoning, the winning card for Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back home with butts in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush’s weakness.
Whoever takes the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
In the U.S., the economic collapse is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the time for suppressions.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly declare to the adherents of the information, to feel less concerned about credibility.
They are not as isolated as they were before.
The problem of journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work on assembling newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if we want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to be consistently reduced.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed versus broadcast.
It’s hard for journalists to see where the internet is going.
The largest publishing houses are frightening a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as the “killer” of newspaper paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology in the hope that it "does something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest gap in American journalism lies between those who run newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to “work safety.”
Managers who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are 47% nationally.
The number of journalists is 30%.
The issue of “safe work” at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a huge nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always get high salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, a certain number of years passed.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often “sick” during the year.
It is the climate’s fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE A GROTTAFERRATA.
The chairman of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had requested to be allowed to leave his town, Grottaferrata, for a home in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During the trial he was charged with last week, he had obtained home release converted into compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the provincial city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such moves (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and have access to the evidence that accuses him.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion bailout plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and are still, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms this, communicating that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its watchful East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to “washington” and the world of finance, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, which was made to feel despotically with the vote that I was talking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been cited is only one example of the changes, of the great changes that the ongoing economic earthquake is anticipating or already letting run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and may not be only here.
In the United States as well as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena of some time ago, to the point that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival, of the dual state-sovereign category, in relation to a sort of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions that have, of course, close relations with the outside world, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balances of people and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for who governs it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be global economically, but politically, it is almost only national here.
Political internationalization really seems out of play, or does not have much to say: the obvious proof is provided to us by the European Union that, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, does not manage to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone expects interventions, plans for rescue and relief, new rules, and above all a love of credit: when one goes through a difficult period, there are only the states who possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the more recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, when we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the non-material, convinced that the globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized one by one, that our future will, on the contrary, have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather insignificant things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can be transported from one place to another on earth, but which are absolutely connected to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, he who is sovereign has more cards than he who is not, that is, he who is unlucky to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, foresees a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And besides, something even deeper, in a sense even disturbing: a discredit, a suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the whole class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have at the same time, and to be increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, The Demand for Leadership subterraneanly fuels a powerful and branched movement of delegitimations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest itself in improvised electoral “revolts” or, in the recent changes in collective moods, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria, to the fall of the Labourists in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressionalists against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy has not come by chance).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have more and more difficulty, which is not from today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis potentially strengthens, increases and agitates in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, speaking of a current “mass rebellion” on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said that keeping your eyes wide open is not without reason.
The supercollar to walk on the walls.
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various U.S. research centers, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded in doing so.
With a glue measuring just 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to keep a 100 kilogram body glued onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The hardware, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti." explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have taken inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that allow to ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests conducted on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time, it is "easy to disconnect from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
“This material could be used as a temporary adhesive,” adds Liming Dai.
It may be that yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, given that carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could be related to aerospace engineering.
At the moment there are no superheroes.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, researchers in California presented a glue formed of microfibers like hair, which cleanses itself from dust during movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medications: Never with fruit juices.
Beware of pomegranate, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in the summer because they are deteriorating and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital drugs, alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing according to the cases, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether in a box or fresh, if associated with the ingestion of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of pomegranate, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital medicines, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
Pomegranate juice has already been heavily criticized for being held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs, up to toxic levels.
It is the Italian drug agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger deriving from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink, if you take medicines such as, for example, Diazepam or Methadon.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by pomegranate and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the Public University of Milan, called: “These findings are generally immediately to the various national and international agencies of medicines that will need to change the informative notes of medicines if necessary.
It is always appropriate to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and if something is unclear, do not get impressed, but clearly address the doctor or pharmacist," he said.
Nobel Prize in Economics for Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman wrote, in an article published in the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction that sparked many controversies, and which was reproached to the economist for years, but which now turned out to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a bit shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive disclosure style, especially critical of the excesses of liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, supervised by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is shown to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and made less sharp, to others more important, such as the compatibility born for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office suite 2007, and it is indeed possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to certain modules, such as one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by e-mail, or to import PDF files into the graphics development module, retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graph with the elements of a spreadsheet or text processor.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the development of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice’s features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can be shipped home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, can already rely on various projects implemented in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a service of training, consultation and assistance, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could otherwise open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentations rival; Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphics module.
Goal for 2008, reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected number
Kohl is also positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
A new case of positivity in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the shirt of the best climber.
This is the website of the Daily Telegraph that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist at the Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also of Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl’s samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third-generation Epo was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, thus refining the peach shirt of the best climber.
Immigrants: The New York Times asks if Italy is racist?
Italy “as a country of emigrants has recently turned into a preferred destination for immigrants” welcomed with reluctance.
This would turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists?This is what the New York Times is talking about, which has devoted a long article to the topic of racism in Italy, starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the Nordic regions are both those where "more integration and more work" are recorded, but also "the country's strongest anti-immigrant sentiment and the most important support for the League of the North."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
not only .
Even the new legislature wanted by the League to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegals is cited as proof of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal, called for the State and the Church to work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
Student housing market is not in crisis
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, the rental union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people from the right to study due to the very high overall costs that families of origin have to support – explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani – in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no rental limit, subleases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax revision are needed to calm prices.
Reading in detail the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, we go from 650 euros minimum (Bande Nere area), to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average, 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single bedroom.
In Rome, in the areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), one asks about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (550 euros for a single one) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina area, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a single one, we spend from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for a bed, you have to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by non-community students, have a subsequent anomaly: the rent requested to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradiso, the cities remove the historical halls.
Historic cinemas are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinema is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centers, but also in the province cities,
The process of the marginalization of the cinemas, with the birth in the periphery of the large multisales, and the death of the consumption of the monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appears to us inevitable and indisputable; it also has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical and memorable places, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so many emotions" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way to live the cinema, lost may be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of traditional type have closed, and it is the halls of the major cities that have paid the most: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romana is at the forefront with 82 lost mono cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilie-Romagne.
"The Italian exploitation has developed irrationally," notes Paolo Protti, chairman of the ANEC, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequentors are not necessarily all willing to go to the multiplex.
Not to mention the failed credit deliberation in favor of merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation through the signing of a protocol between the City Hall and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono cinemas halls of the historic centers and the periphery.
Among the normatives envisaged are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area, and will have special rates for parking and in some parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that in order to counter the superpower of the multiplex, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, as today’s audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradiso" which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass by the Rialto, or Quirinal de Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn to the other side to not see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to uniformize the municipality’s choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan.”
Heavy charges are being filed by the magistrates of the anti-mafia direction of Calabria, against the mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external contest for mafia association.
The controls also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his young son lawyer, the same name as the boss, already convicted of association of mafia type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"An insult to legal and moral normatives, and above all to common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to officially enter the councils facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration."
The Chairman of the Calabria regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Ndrangheta, heroes who are honest.”
The arrests this morning followed those of last July, after which police announced that they had decapitated the Piromalli clan.
As early as the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still due to presumed conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the City.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, was appointed head of a center-right coalition after the May 2006 ballot.
He cried out to the scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the then deputy interior minister, Marco Minniti, of manipulating the whole for a political matter, but given the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even managed to request the modification of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the PM writes, is emerging "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, uniformizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy comes from the waves, now the big ones start.
This is an excessive deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and now major global energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have placed their eyes, and now are trying to put their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the ecologists and the new rise of oil give a great boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of global electricity needs could be covered by ocean wave operating systems.
That would be twice as much as nuclear power plants produce.
In addition, there will be streams and tide.
Colossus at the attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would have been a real revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more candidates among these companies dedicated to traditional energy are betting on marine energy.
“Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and it is evaluating the possibilities of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to give rise to a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which travel the path of energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are unknown, according to observers, indicate growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in its early days, on the part that marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems like those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create a big problem to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, we need to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
“And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of beams connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the mud up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure causes a turbine to turn, which in turn powers a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
For now, we have four such systems in the project phase, awaiting a single federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing power for a shopping center and a parking lot using six turbines under New York’s East River.
The movement of water during tide causes the turbine pales to rotate, creating a rotational movement that fuels a generator.
Verdant has announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to extract energy.
After the waves, the tide.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electrical Energy Research, deserves at this time, the potential of tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the tide energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, invested $7.5 million in 2008 and foresees investments of up to 35 million in 2009.
