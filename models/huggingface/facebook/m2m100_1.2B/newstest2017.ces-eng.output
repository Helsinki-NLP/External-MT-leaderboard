28-Year-Old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Store
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was on the stairs of a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t think of who wants to hurt him, adding, “He’s finally getting better.”
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a twenty-eight-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the forensic doctor’s office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
A brother of the victim, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who was formerly a row cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A restaurant spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and devastated” by his death.
“We have a small team that works like a closely connected family and we will miss it very much,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrow are with Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank first slept in hostels, but recently “he finally started to get well.”
“He found an apartment, went out with a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to get together with his family, he always cooked food for us, he made dinner for us,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to get involved in any quarrels.
He was a man who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world were wrong, he was an unbrushed diamond that shone every day,” he said.

Czech railways have invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, the state carrier has invested more than 31 billion CZK in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernization in each year except for 2012 are gradually decreasing.
Czech railways have invested more than 31 billion CZK in vehicle modernization over the past six years.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent was reflected in reducing the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for conventional wagons.
The carrier invested more in regional transportation, where about 60 percent of the money was spent, and 40 percent was invested in the repair of vehicles for long-distance transportation.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
Modernized older vehicles are counted as new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles were not counted, the average age of motor vehicles would increase by ten years.
Somewhat older are on average passenger cars, whose average age when counting upgrades is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of production was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classical wagons and locomotives have gradually disappeared from Czech and world railways and have been replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives dropped from 280 to 223 units, and the number of classic wagons dropped from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was deprived of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during driving.
During the period from January to July, 110 of these vehicles were destroyed.
Among the investments that ČD plans to make in the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to include the purchase of 50 cars for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for the domestic high-speed route.
The contract includes up to 30 units of motor and 20 units of electric units.
Authorities have been aware of illegal advertising for a quarter of a year and are unable to get rid of it.
We are helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the online newspaper Aktuálně.cz has been following the story of a billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a tourist interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also the Olympic Park.
The motorway managers know they are standing there, but they say they can’t do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of similar advertisements across the country.
According to officials, the blame is a messy law, which makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, a complex bureaucracy is needed.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office will be short.
Or just move the advertisement a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main move from Českých Budějovic to Lipno, a advertising billboard is standing on our land near the state road.
Three months, however, were not enough for officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertisement poster.
As if no one bothered to stand next to the road, in a fifty-metre protection zone, where for safety reasons nothing is allowed.
Road managers say that they can’t simply consult with the billboard due to the breaking law.
You can load it and take it away.
"We cannot afford this," said Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the Road and Motorway Directorate, referring to the complicated bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be prevented by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began online daily Aktuálně.cz to follow in detail in the spring, is not unusual and indicates a general problem that the state and authorities can not solve effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Czech Republic, the editorial has counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules next to or near the road.
Other countries are on the same.
"We have trouble forcing the company to remove the trailers," confirms the head of the transport department of the Czechoslovak district office Jiří Klása, whose colleagues are dealing with similar stories.
According to the class, it is the fault of a corrupt law that binds officials.
First, it has to be difficult to appeal to the owner of the billboard to put the advertisement away.
However, the chiefs of companies are often unattainable or know the finte that has already been described by Aktuálně.cz in the past, when the problem began to be more detailed: it is enough to move the mobile stand with the advertisement a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertisement into the basket.
This is because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is viewed as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Jiří Klása.
The new law will not help.
A change could be brought by a new law, which from September next year will ban billboards on motorways and limit them on roads of I. classes.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same as before.
The authorities do not get so.
Companies can make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on the rental of illegal areas and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech Buddhist Magistrate is currently conducting three administrative proceedings with her overhead billboards.
The company is facing a $300,000 fine in each case.
There are several advertisements that were placed without permission in the protected zone of the road I. class.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Czechoslovak Budějovsky magistrate.
Advertising, which Aktuálně.cz is interested in, is not yet among these cases, but it is likely to increase soon.
According to RSD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinova, the company has not responded to repeated written calls to remove the case, and the case will be brought to the table of the district and then probably magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that fails to contact.
It does not take over the mail and the official headquarters in Žižkov was canceled more than six years ago.
It is not clear who is behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Czech entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who became famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents the Comerz Billboard platforms and offers them to advertisers, has denied any link in the past.
At the same time this spring, when the RSD began to be interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer let state officials send a letter to the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the new company is allegedly located.
So far, no one has contacted the motorway managers.
A futile fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, one company was fined at a rate of two million crowns.
They changed the name and there was nothing to do.
The executive returned the case, the advertisements stood still, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite helpless against such companies and their business practices.
It’s like fighting windmills, one of the officials admits on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet dealt with the law in this regard.
He spoke with several members who were concerned about the issue.
So far, no activity has been developed.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restriction, on the other hand, they need them themselves for advertising in election campaigns.
I don’t believe that if something doesn’t work, the law needs to be changed.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more beets and maca, statistics estimate.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, this year’s grain harvest will be 6.7% lower than last year.
However, this year’s harvest is above the average for the past five and ten years.
In contrast, the harvest will be higher (3.9 percent) and the harvest will be higher (2.5 percent).
This year’s grain harvest will be 6.7% lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is according to an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decimal decrease from last year.
Last year’s grain harvest was above average.
This year’s harvest is higher than the average for the past five and ten years.
This year, the harvest will be higher.
Repic growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they got under the roof of 1.256 million tons.
This year’s crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year.
The expected decrease in grain production is due both to a decrease in hectare yield by 3.7 percent to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in planting area.
This year, farmers planted 3 percent less fields.
Wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested by 3.3% less this year.
The farmers were sending them to other fields.
The decrease will mean a lower hectare yield, which will fall to 6,04 tons.
Approximately a fifth decline is predicted for spring barley, which is most often used to make beer.
The decrease in harvest is due to a 15.2% reduction in planting areas and a lower hectare yield.
On the other hand, it will produce 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of grain will also increase.
Statistics estimate the crop to be 1.305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The seed area increased by 7.3 percent.
The hectare yield will be 3.2% lower than last year.
This year’s cabbage harvest will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while the planting is one-third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years there has also been an increase in fields of mackerel.
This year the farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the Czech Mac was grown on a record 70,000 hectares, the fields are half.
Thanks to the expansion of the seedlings, this year’s harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 percent from last year to 27,423 tonnes.
The hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of attacking with a knife and machete, the court sent them to custody.
Police accused two assailants of attacking a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in downtown Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Al the attacked man was trying to escape, he was injured and injured, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both suspects were arrested immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff submitted a request to the court for their arrest and the court accepted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two detainees of attacking a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers caused him urinary and cut wounds, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that occurred on Tuesday at noon in the Freedom class, police said.
The perpetrators were detained, police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
A massive clash between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the centre of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two assailants attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he suffered urinary and cutaneous injuries that required treatment in the hospital and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The clash, which caused a lot of attention in the city centre and for which several police patrols and police officers had to intervene on the scene, was a family dispute.
Criminals accused a 43-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc of attempting to seriously injure his health.
The plaintiff filed a court request for their arrest and the court accepted it on Friday, the spokeswoman added.
The machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle by the attackers also five years ago, it happened then only a few dozen meters further, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrov Street.
Police said a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked guests who stood in front of the entrance.
Police said they had knives, sticks and masks in their hands.
The court then sentenced the two offenders to a conditional sentence.
Empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You’ll be surprised, maybe you’re walking around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the vast building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senovážný náměstí.
It had long been used as a hotel.
Still nothing though.
It is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis.
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Václav Square, there are several houses that, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, only become empty.
We selected properties in the center using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of the financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty homes than homeless people.
The taxpayer needs to pay a special tax.
Fidel Castro was killed and Hitler’s brother was killed.

Clinton’s husbands earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
More than $1 million was donated to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton’s income – over $6 million – comes from their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, increasing pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
Most of Clinton’s income – over $6 million – comes from their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her pre-election campaign.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s husbands paid a 34.2% federal income tax last year, followed by a state and local income tax of 9%.
In total, they paid 43.2% of their income.
But Trump has a problem with a similar move, so far not determined to publish the tax declaration.
"There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all," Clinton tweeted minutes after her confession was released.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrets about Trump's income, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as wealthy as she claims.
Trump’s wealth is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the Republican candidate’s reputation as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax deductions over the past ten years.
He and his wife, Anne Holton, donated 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and 25.6 percent of their earnings to taxes last year.
Polio broke out again in Nigeria.
Islamists from Boko Haram prevented vaccination and killed doctors.
Children's polio cases have reappeared in Nigeria.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government has declared emergency vaccination because two children infected with the disease have died.
Vaccines were transported by helicopters.
In the area, Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram acted, preventing vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has circulated there unnoticed.
In northeastern Nigeria, emergency polio vaccination will begin after two children infected with the disease have died there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in neighboring states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered children's polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has been circulating in the area for many years.
In the past, extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also prevented doctors from reaching areas where children with polio were detected on Thursday.
Both children came with refugees from a part of Nigeria recently liberated from Boko Haram.
Michel Zaffran, the director of the WHO section for the eradication of polio, told the BBC that the vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
The Islamic extremist group Boko Haram has been active in Borno for a long time.
The area was not opened to international organizations and the government until early this year, when Boko Haram managed to fundamentally weaken this part of the country.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that the new cases of polio are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that it was eradicated.
The WHO warned that it is possible that although the disease has not appeared for two years, it has spread among children.
Children up to 5 years old will be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases worldwide.
In 1988, polio was in 125 countries, but only in three regions: Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang.
The Pope heard their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Pope Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and call for intensification of the fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who had been freed from power by police.
The head of the Catholic Church spent more than an hour listening to the touching stories of the fallen women and then urging them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
According to the Vatican, all of them were subjected to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution.
With his visit, Pope Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and call for intensification of the fight against it, the pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often points to the fate of people on the margins of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican in April and June this year on his personal invitation.
France attacks jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not happen.
Muslims themselves are helping France in the fight against radical Islamism.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is also planning fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of the clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer halls.
There will be more, the Interior Minister said.
There are over 100 jihadist factories in the country.
“If Muslims don’t help the state in the fight against those who undermine public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that religion’s freedom,” said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France should preach in mosques and prayer rooms.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20% of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
Even for this reason, preachers are being placed in mosques, which can spread radicalism in France.
“Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,” he added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should serve as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
At that time, the foundation was to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that fund their construction.
However, the institution was soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalry.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said recently.
After the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, there was a debate in the French political scene about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was accelerated by further terrorist attacks in France, which were carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has announced that the new foundation will be established in October.
He will have two main tasks - to provide financing for mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee imams.
For now it is not clear where it will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
Several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal foods.
This would, in practice, be paid by halal food vendors for providing certification.
Part of that money would then go to the fund.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros ($270 to €540) could then be paid by French pilgrims who travel to Mecca.
Approximately 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia every year.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, mosques should only be used by preachers who have undergone special education programs at French universities.
This should ensure that preaching is compatible with democracy.
Close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is fighting against the radicals.
And there will be others to follow, the Interior Minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of our country’s principles, such as gender equality.
It is estimated that there are about 2,500 mosques and prayer halls in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams, and several dozen others are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly interfere against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
It doesn’t happen in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Baugém.
For the eight-finals, the Czech rail cyclist must fight in repair rides.
Race cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after progressing from the qualification of the sprint among the best eighteen lost in the first round of the match with the French giant Grégory Baugé, the defender of silver from the past games in London.
The course to the eight-finals has to be fixed.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders, and the best Czech racer of the present time wrote the fourteenth best time.
He reached the 200th place in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected in the qualification by the fifth Baugé, who already has the bronze from Ria in the team sprint.
Kelemen, though, at the end of the day, touched on an experienced Frenchman, but he watched for the move.
The golden defender Jason Kenny is out.
The twenty-eight-year-old British took the third fastest two-hundred in history, winning the qualifying in an Olympic record of 9,551.
He also managed to make the last move, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet, along with Bradley Wiggins, set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km race and went to the final.
The maximum of 3:51,659, which the British had four years since the Olympics in London, has improved by more than a second.
Young Doctors Press: They Want Fresh Wind in the Industry
Representatives of the young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask for full advice to support further field events from early September.
JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issue regarding the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to reject the contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who took part in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government had “continued to remain silent” on questions, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In light of this, the executive body of the JDC voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and demand new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing programme of intensified industry events from early September.
The dispute led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after a decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told members of the BMA at pre-voting meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of “incompatible” countries?
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to lay hands and announce the formal end of the eight-month long word war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxurious hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wants to long for this reconciliation more.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and barely radiated warmth from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” to Mr. Putin – five times, as one of the reports states.
I did not count.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the Turkish shooting down of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin blamed Ankara for hitting Moscow with a knife in the back.
The scare was so much greater that it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, even impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media for months led a massive campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks could do everything.
More serious were the accusations from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg there was an official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he had asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared such a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also shaken him.
There is also an economic motivation.
The Russian sanctions have had a tough impact – especially the cancellation of charter flights, which each year transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will surely relax here when flights are eventually resumed.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey were again allowed.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” the newspaper Vedemosti.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting resentment of the lengthy talks on EU accession and Putin’s accession – who is eager to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader earned bonus points when Ankara asked for help from elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is given.
So the summit in this pompious, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of incompatible”: how they unite the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West.
However, despite publicly showing mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow has recently placed itself in the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after three hours of initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
But after months of open hostilities – and given the risk of a complete catastrophe when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet – it is better for the two leaders to talk together again at least.
Royal Bank of Scotland to shut down for customers outside Scotland
According to the executive director of the bank, the RBS brand is suppressed into the role of back office.
Royal Bank of Scotland will lose money for customers outside of Scotland
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She was relieved of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
It cost millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
Now, however, it has been decided that it is better to give more emphasis to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new trades.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more to the forefront – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
During his trips to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now much more a bank of brands.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in its own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
“It’s a good time for us to move to the bank of brands, because the fundamental question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for our customers?” he said.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical to say that we will become a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with how we have focused on the needs of our customers rather than our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can recall these signs again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in the Newmarket on the Predilection riding brought to the goal 3000th winner
Dettori Spruces Champagne After Double Victory at Newmarket Brings Them 3,000 Victories
Frankie Dettori won his 3000th victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track – the Predilection horse, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Joker to have achieved such a result in row racing.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time jackpot champion Dettori, who previously won on a Ghayyar horse, said, “It’s weird.”
I am very excited because my family is here too.
I’m extremely happy that this happened in Newmarket, because it’s where I founded myself 30 years ago.
It’s not a huge event, it’s not the Royal Ascot – it’s a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
It relieved me and I am very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when it brings Predilection after victory
Two Jokers have reached this milestone in obstacle racing – champion Joker Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who in his record-breaking career has brought to the goal more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jokers of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He’s stylish and strong, but it’s his tactical fist that distinguishes him from the other riders in the heavyweight.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he didn’t just ride on weekends and big races, he’d already have 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie has driven winners in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
He has a lively nature, which is good for the British racing sport.But more importantly, he is an incredible joker.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his famous flying jump
From the late finishes to the late leaps, Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like a ride on a mountain track.
There were countless winners of major races, including his famous “Great Seven” in Ascot, but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from taking off due to drugs.
He stagnated for the first time three years ago when he returned after a six-month start ban, but showed incredible inner strength and, despite all doubters, returned in his best shape.
And maybe it won’t be the last time – Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years old.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired head of office Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin had “dismissed Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was given.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vajno was formerly a diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he later made the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
Speaking to Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of state in the sense of drafting laws and monitoring to what extent your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his removal and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Convincing a smile?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and, like Putin, he worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles to the cameras have convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once considered a possible president wants to suddenly lead Russia’s environmental policy has met with great distrust.
The Kremlin’s website cites comments addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me this very demanding post, even a problematic post, for four years.
I seem to have been the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
In his time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could succeed Putin after his second term as president, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close Putin associate, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, star of The Criminal's Thoughts, released after hitting director
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on stage last month in Los Angeles.
The television stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, in a joint statement announced its release.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his dismissal.
There were creative differences on stage and disagreements.
I am sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
According to a statement from ABC and CBS television stations, details of how Gibson’s character disappears from a series that follows the stories of a team of FBI agents are a little later.
The 54-year-old actor, who became famous for his role in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has played in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love Criminal Thoughts and over the past twelve years I’ve put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement.
I hoped I’d be there until the end, but that’s not possible.
I would like to thank the authors, the producers, the actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show has ever hoped for.
The 12th series is expected to return on September 28.
In Banff town mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish could be sandstorms left there by a water crash.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his discovery on Periscope in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have linked the northern plateau with Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct – the bridge now connects to Fife.
This is the first of four locks between the platforms, which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The part of the Fife bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building the Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we’re all witnessing how construction engineers have actually used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel on an impressive scale to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the lock between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
More than 79 percent of the bridge’s total area is now in place, and concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be picked up onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first lock when building any bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this lock-up represents the tip of land construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side – towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approximation viaduct 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
The viaduct is massive because it is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled with a climbing of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances the team worked with were very small – just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are “happy to be alive” after being washed off by water from their fishing boat near Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to sail safely, while their boat continued unchecked.
“We saw their boat crossing near them and the worst came to mind,” said Vince Jones, a rescue boat steward at Moelfre.
“Fortunately, the strong wind took him away from them before we left,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, 60 years old, was found exhausted without a lifeguard while holding onto a fight.
All were transferred to the coastal rescue boat and transported back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “Three men dropped into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The boat's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person driving the boat when the overturn occurred.
Someone above the boys held a protective hand.
The judge refused to resolve the case because of the wife of Tluchoř.
Petr Tluchoř is one of three MPs who, according to the prosecution, had to receive from Prime Minister Nečase and his then head of cabinet Jany Nagyova political traffic, i.e. a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Šnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him to resign.
Then they appeared on influential positions in state firms.
They also faced suspicions of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, it was unjustified, and there was a total compensation of almost 2 million crowns.
He is now serving as a witness in the case, following the interference of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (resolving criminal matters - note. red.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another court of Prague.
The King has already forgiven Jan Nečas twice, previously Nagy.
It was alleged to have used military intelligence to track Prime Minister Nečas Radka’s first wife.
In this case, the bulldozer did not appear.
But according to the lawyer Jaroslaw Ortman, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude a court if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I am afraid that there would be no judgment at all, he noted for the journal.
“I think it’s overwhelmed,” he added.
In the case of political traffic is also accused Roman Boček, a former official.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
On June 13, the district court for Prague 1 dealt with the charges of former chief of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petra Nečasa Jany Nagyová (now Nečasová) and other accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the film, she comes to court with her husband.
She had to talk about Periscope.
The exhibitor’s wife, for example, was to judge the statements of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutkov.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolchildren is dead.
She was killed in an airstrike by Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old friends from London’s Gatwick airport in February.
The British Interior Ministry has not commented on her death.
The young London girls who fled their homes were, according to police, secretly taken to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana have been targeted by their other former classmate from London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year caused a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that about 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a $100,000 salary.
It’s a well-paid job that you don’t even need college for.
This is how the first look of the work of the Aegean looks.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary (in Prague, you can earn up to 180,000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
The most sought-after are, according to the statistics of the Grafton personnel agency, programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, the candidates will not compete for a job, but the job positions will compete for candidates, commented Jitka Součková, marketing manager of Grafton Recruitment.
High school is not necessary.
Higher education is not a necessity.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and educability, but it often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
They earn the most in Prague.
The salaries are well above the republican average.
Most of the money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hitparade.
“The salary conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague,” Kubačka says.
Technical directors will get the highest salary.
In Prague and Brno can come to 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below 80,000 CZK.
IT project managers are also in demand.
They can earn between 60,000 and 100,000.
It is also about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of employment, this does not apply in the case of the Ayatollahs.
If companies are pulled over and overpaid by a specialist from another company, they are happy to reach for a graduate.
You can raise them according to your own.
Without language cannot be done.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least decent English is necessary for the Ayatiks.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a lot of cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally educated and experienced person and are only satisfied with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks more foreign languages, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries.
Googling is paradise.
Google employees can be jealous of Google employees.
Of course, they have flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various shortened employment, not only for mothers.
“The company provides newly born fathers with four weeks of extra leave after the birth of a child,” said Martina Jonek, a spokeswoman for Google.
It also includes health care for employees and family, food, transportation, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn, has the green light and it doesn’t matter what new he wants to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
A free refrigerator is definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations even breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all the offices, where people will always find a healthy snack.
And so that nothing has to be thrown out, so what does not sleep, it will be put into boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
What is the reason for these incredible benefits for Czechs?
Create a creative and motivating environment.
“For Google, it’s not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” he added.
The UN has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein on Thursday accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concern that Bulgaria does not comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is disturbing to witness how important and influential public figures publicly express support for the criminal armed militants who boldly organize the pursuit of refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey.”
“One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who enter Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested,” Zeid said.
Even worse, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned – for a year or longer – if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that according to international law everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 last year in the same period.
Pokémon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world changes.
Many people over the past decade have complained that teenagers and children no longer play outdoors and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go raises people from the couches and leads them to activity.
Time spent in front of screens was originally reduced to television, later to video games, and most recently to smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
I’m talking, of course, about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later came the cartoon series, play cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand before the release of the new game in early July.
The release in other countries was postponed due to huge interest, which led to overload of servers.
Pokémon Go has gained more users in just a few days than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, smartphone players go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “photograph” them (through a screenshot on the phone) or “catch them”.
The mania has captured the generation who played the game at a younger age, lifting it up from the seats and driving out to look for Pokémon.
In the United States, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps the “average” person takes every day.
Apple’s Cardiogram for Smartwatches app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of watched people who exercised for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t have any information about who’s playing Pokémon Go – they only see gross data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns aimed at getting people to “find 30”, “rise up from the couch” and “be active every day” have fallen on unfruitful ground because most public health-focused messages are boring and aimed at people who don’t look good.
The importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we can’t list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something that enjoys them.
You cover the three pillars of health – movement, fresh air and sunlight.
Some people even find new friends in the hunt for Pokémon.
There are, of course, a lot of boring patrons who are looking for excuses to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
And what, how ?
A breakthrough occurred.
At the time, apps for smartphones, such as Fitbit, were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news begins to appear and interest in it begins to fade at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better shape.

Simone Biles wins gold in female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to this.
Dynamic to jump.
No effort on the pitch.
All of them are simple.
Excellent in everything.
And finally the Olympic championship.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went on a straight path for the title in multi-fighting on Thursday and overcame the rest on a full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The total score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her advance over the silver medalist and member of the “final five” team Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during an appearance on the claw in the finals of the multiplayer individual in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multiplayer, and the fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and the best ever.
When her overall final rating was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success puts her in the same league of unique athletes of her time, such as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to her sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at world championships – including 10 gold medals. Her stunning composition is a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the best gymnast she has ever seen.”
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racing women, but between herself and the burden of too much expectation.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's single-player final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
Biles won the first place on Tuesday, when she was as a screamer in the celebration of the departing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists she never looked forward during her long journey to the summit, which is not so true.
A portion of her composition in simple - the one that contains her typical triple twisted salto - is put into Latin music that would just fit home, into the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
The competition in multiplayer hasn't been lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a sequence of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and prostne – where Biles defends the world championship – are waiting.
She got back to the forefront with 15,433 points for the blade - and finished with 15,933 points in the prosths.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score – a mere formality – and around the shiny red, white and blue shadows, Biles’ tears appeared when a wish she once wrote in her diary as a child was fulfilled.
Raisman’s performance was a bit of a retaliation for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but then she took bronze because of the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call the “grandmother”, was quite ahead.
She sent a crowd of kisses in the air, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this nineteen-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most important attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’s daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the arrival road.
The report states that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from a hand gun and then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple murder is not a robbery, because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the $2,900 amount that one of the adult victims had with him.
A Phoenix police spokesman, sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators are investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two mostly Hispanic neighborhoods, nine attacks took place in four months, killing seven people and wounding two others.
“It’s happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’s KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators declined to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she subsequently succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities have also released a police report about the shooting, the target of which was an empty truck just half an hour before the three-time murder.
Investigators found ammunition and from the remains of bullets in the seat and from under the cap of the engine they assembled a bullet.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mom.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When I first came home, I was the first to think I couldn’t do that.
I cannot handle this.
I am not ready for this.
This is not the case at all – you are clearly prepared for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learn that Edmund may never know them and may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institute.
“My first reaction was that I thought people don’t do this anymore today,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with a pedestal.
Until the age of three, he could neither sit nor crawl, and still could not speak.
Some milestones are slowly being filled.
He helps and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth performs a sign language in which Edmund says, “Please sing to me.”
“We are teaching him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it’s not the usual sign language – he says that Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and post-pregnancy infections caused by viruses, such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciut recalls the emotional tax chosen by an uncertain future.
I am constantly asking, “What will happen next?”
What will be next?
And she is still not sure.
In fact, I’ve never asked what the overall forecast is because I don’t expect anyone to tell me at all.
Picciut has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods require rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread floods in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has that a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are leaking out of their shores after extreme rainfall and threatening extensive floods.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and aid is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they are receiving requests for water-powered vehicles, boats and sand bags.
Steele said that only the district of Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand sacks of sand.
Flood patrols will remain operational in most of Southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that there could be another 8 to 13 centimeters above the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood guard was on alert on Friday as rain continued in the area of Mobile.
The rivers Comite at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs are expected to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both rivers could flood a number of homes in the suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further said that the danger is floods after the current in the district of Ascension, when these divided streams will only slowly spill into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the border of the state of Mississippi in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the tidal waters in the county of Amite and Wilkinson in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among the rescued at Gloster earlier Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other son-in-law, who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water was approaching,” Hansford said.
We had it in our passport.
According to his wife, this is the highest level he has ever experienced on the river in 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers rescued all three giant military-style trucks and carried them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods are “quickly spreading” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston 35 centimeters of rainfall from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily drained since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid roads required rescues from their homes in the Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of lessons in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS that, according to an elder from Tangipahoa, 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by the high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
“They will be able to go home when the water starts to drop,” he said.
In the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and locals were provided with sacks of sand to pick up and try to protect their homes and from the water.
“The last major flooding we had here was in March,” said town administrator Lacy Landrum.
These floods are similar.
Rupert Lacy, emergency management manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said the persistent rain continues on the Gulf coast.
He said a couple of homes had been flooding on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in several places where I’ve never seen it before,” said Townson, “and it’s still there.”
Mahaj Brown, 6 years old, survived a shooting in Philadelphia
A six-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia this week, according to police.
The grandparents of the child identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot injuries, including the thighs, legs, arms and stomach, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
“He caught a terrible amount of stuff, his little body was shrouded,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I cannot believe.
He is in critical condition and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He had to enter the first class of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three other men were shot, two aged 29 and one aged 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stabilized condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be the shooter.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there was probably a shooting between several armed men.
On the scene were found ammunition from weapons of the attack type, belonging to various attack weapons.
It seemed to be a continuing battle.
There were bullets on both sides of the street.
So it appears there were several armed fighters who were actively involved," Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are allegedly investigating video footage from cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a missing shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine a female gymnastics team for this year’s Olympic Games, for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And second: There are three gymnastes in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also consolidated the presence of Negroes and Latin Americans at the top of this sport.
For the last four years, she has been an African-American gymnast.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
It means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in female individual multiplayer.
Team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics hours in the country it doesn’t look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five” because the gymnastics team for the next Olympic Games will be made up of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the reality is that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which areined by parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, trips, shirts, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their confidants and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for gymnast families and gymnasts this is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who have been inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started gymnastics 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people across the city (mostly black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, school and work achievements.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It is a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating “girl power” and winning the Olympic Team Gold.
Following the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
The ministers hoped that a revised agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA) would end disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the elections rejected the agreement.
Hunt revealed plans to enforce the contract in July, saying that the NHS was in “none’s land” and that further delays would have a detrimental impact on staff and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care during non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, said last night in a statement: “Young physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current workforce crisis will rise and therefore fair treatment of all physicians.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors passes under a new contract, progress is needed and time is coming.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have met with reluctance to engage Dr. and often with shameful silence on the part of the government.
And despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for enforcement and solve the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike in late April, 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that the conclusion of the revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would bring to an end the disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for weekend work for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “Over-the-counter action will little or nothing at all, but it will create pressure on already overcrowded teams and services and increase concerns, exhaustion and disturbance for patients, care staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have talked with the Council of Young Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continued positive involvement in other important issues—such as loading, training flexibility, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap—was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are taking the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
$60 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attacks will be able to take the medication, which costs around SEK sixty (two pounds).
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a recurrence in people with heart disease.
The drug is now administered for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other attack.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart attack.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a coherent layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn apart, a blood clot can develop, blocking the access of blood to the heart and developing a heart attack.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making it less likely to develop clots.
The NICE directive proposal, published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg along with aspirin, twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Center for Healthcare Technology Assessment, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we can expand the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor – especially the risk of bleeding – beyond three years is limited, treatment beyond this period is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption.
A culture of political correctness has led to the overlooking spread of fraud in Muslim communities, a government report said.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized the police, election inspectors, and city councils for ignoring the abuse of voters for “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
A former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that police should make cordons in front of the polling stations and protect feared voters.
He recommended that voters take their passports with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
Voters now need to provide their name and address.
The report also proposes to apply indelible ink on people’s fingers when they vote to prevent voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to have greater access to documents from meetings and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about protecting against electoral fraud, it’s also about protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and financial fraud that go hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was requested by Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that the current mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post after accusations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “cynically affected” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, “led his campaign so that it was a religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were challenged or as a result of identity theft, when one votes and pretends to be someone else.
Sir Eric said there is evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern over fraud in the correspondence voting — allegedly by elderly members of the Muslim community during which they pressured people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including submitting an identity document
The report states: “There has been evidence that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were concerns that ... state institutions were shutting their eyes on such behavior because of “politically correct” over-sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent “vote exploitation.”
The report, now evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefits fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present identity documents before voting.
Use of indelible ink on the fingers of people when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic nationality checks to ensure that persons are eligible to vote.
Applications for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating mailed votes and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polling stations.
Amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons exercising unlawful coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibition of taking photos in polling stations.
Require only English people (except Wales) to work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it’s “surprising” that no criminal charges have been raised after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The court for election matters excluded Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons beyond reasonable doubts - in the power of evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful “checking of checkboxes” in the municipality’s voter registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in the Tower Hamlets case awakened.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities threaten this reputation.
The cycling duo of Duchess Kate and other celebrities at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy to French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is quite similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old is far from the only athlete aspiring to gold this year who can boast of her own duo from the ranks of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the female column FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted beast: American archer Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Alongside Kate’s twin on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a racer from the U.S. archery team, sparked a storm on Twitter after his pictures appeared to look like a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted he had heard about his similarities with Lee since he was a kid.
“He doesn’t see much similarity, except for the beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
“He’s a guy and he looks good, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking likeness between British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her big, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to series star Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for the change: User thinks Nathan is the "athletic version" of the actor from the movie The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is a comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov boasts not only the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team fans say she looks like “the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Fit Women: Football star Hope Solová (left) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eye shape
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarity
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similar appearance of couples
A Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
Football star Hope Sol and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter really have incredibly similar facial shape and eyes.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or gymnastics gold medalist Gabby Douglas, boasting with her wonderfully wide smile, as if copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of the film Bravo, girls!
Olympic commentator at CBC apologizes for saying a Chinese swimmer had "exploded"
The audience of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on CBC station was upset by the analysis of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan's performance by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's race on 4x200 m squad free style
The Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “traced like a smell” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed his microphone had been turned off when he began to whisper his own opinions at the end of the women’s 4x200 metres final.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “recovery” to the CBC commentary team, said, among other things: “That little 14-year-old from China has given up, you fools.”
Excessive excitement, it pulled like smell, it exploded.
thank you .
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14 years old, floated the second stage of the race at 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to reach China.
Audiences in Canada began to hear quickly online and were shocked by the tone and language used by the commentator.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did that messenger say to CBC that the fourteen-year-old swimmer from China has ‘exploded’????”
The idiot did not notice that he was still on the broadcast.”
Ai Yanhan of China was described in the women’s 4x200-meter freestyle racing final as: “The little 14-year-old from China has given up, you fool.”
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his appeal
When Twitter users learned how senseless Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and it sounds like we’re a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC, apologized for MacDonald's live comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we’re sorry that it happened.”
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russell apologizes on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and placed their apology in a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about commentator MacDonald’s comments.
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
He sincerely regrets that the words were uttered, they should not get into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the broadcast and those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron’s comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words.Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his comment by claiming he didn’t want it to sound like a personal assault.
“I would like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s squad,” he said in an Olympic broadcast on CBC.
“I meant the performance of a swimmer, not the person of a swimmer as such.”
“There’s no need to say I didn’t intend any disrespect, and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark embarrassed by a woman who embarrassedly tried underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman took off her clothes to try her trousers in the middle of Primark, the shoppers were not sure which way to look.
To make it worse, she tested her size, took off her trousers and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and finally tried four pairs of trousers at the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried her trousers before returning them to the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman, after trying out her underwear, “dressed up again and went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, “People couldn’t believe their own eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took her trousers from the shelf, took off her own trousers and trousers and put them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a discrete place – she just stood there, shaking like a monkey.”
“Everyone was watching her pants take off again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she brought them back to the shelf.”
She did the same with three others before finally deciding that she didn’t like anything, dressed up again and left.
“She looked like she didn’t care who was watching — nor did she think of the man who would buy the pants she tried.”
Miss Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone takes home the trousers that someone else was wearing and no one has cleaned them is disgusting.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things that I obviously tried to get them out of sale – which is the only thing that’s right.”
“I would be frightened to bring my new pants home and find out that another woman was wearing them, took them off, and that they were not washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9.
All products were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Weapons Attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but with this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Ron Mizrachi, a New York-based Krav Magy Federation grandmaster, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain superiority over the perpetrator, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free runway of the missile.”
You then grab the gun between your elbow and shoulder just before hitting it in the face with a loose elbow.
Then the knee goes into the thighs, and while the attacker switches in pain, you scratch his gun out of his hand, hit him in the face and start to retreat, while holding the gun directed at him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, this is a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab the gun and curl it so that the villain can’t shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then screw the weapon from his seizure and begin to retreat, still targeting him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of the robberies – unless you’re a Krav Maga master – is to give out all your cash.
Traveler Ian Wright Lies the Dirtyest Places in Europe into a Travel Guide
A British traveler has decided to test his immune system and the stinking reflex by licking the dirtyest and most tasteless places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk-born journalist and journalist, licked with his tongue a euro banknote, a fence at the Piccadilly Circus, a splash button on the toilet in a train, and a Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was doing.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the washer button in a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem absolutely repugnant, but there are actually many more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his entire trip to Europe, Ian Wright talked to doctors and healthcare specialists about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing left him worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the resistance of his intestines when traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely – from public fences at train stations to a splasher.
In the film he filmed about it, he says: “From childhood, I didn’t care much about my health and put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and mud water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple scratch, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, newly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while fresh-washed hands have fewer than 60 units.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy maker Valio have made a traveler’s film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the film, he said, “This is almost the ugliest thing I’ve ever felt in the bathroom.”
There is nothing more dirty than this.
I’m not going to lick anything, because it’s disgusting.
Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength was made in collaboration with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which in humans help to strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something truly new.
Something that would follow with fascination and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of “let’s call Ian.”
It is said that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Rather than just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context – the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it’s connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought consumers more detailed information in an interesting way.
There is also a great sense of humor in the film.
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: “Let’s say this, Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted from him – such as the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Licking some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were rather difficult.
I’m glad that we’ve licked some of those dirty things.”
Valio conducted a 2015 survey that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A family of socially needy people destroyed a municipality building in Saltash, Cornwall before displacement
A family of socially needy people left £50,000 in damage to their townhouse after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evacuated from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forcible displacement from the house, the housing cooperative officials were shocked to find out that the property was in an emergency state.
There were holes in the walls, the floor was crushed, rubbish rolled everywhere on the floor, and the walls were crushed.
The family has already moved and is believed to live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned about whether the house would be saved.
She said, “It was a nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances should be considered, as this property will probably fit into the awareness as a “not so nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple has three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and police said the horror controls the family carried out included street battles using baseball beams, intimidating the surrounding population, using drugs, distributing drugs and loud screaming, quarrels and insults.
Skeldon (47), whose name was stated on the lease agreement, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in a house that may be demolished, stinking garbage was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, a floor cover was ripped out
Neighbors say they’ve seen them on the street, and regularly people called the police.
Cornwall Housing forcibly relocated her and her partner from home this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to relocate voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the displacement with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We’ve lived with them for 20 years and it’s always been like that.
How many times I’ve been there can’t be counted.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was incredible silence here – we’re not used to it!
It will be nice when they are finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a neighborhood supervision manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called by the police
Garbage and old toys were dumped in the town hall.
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has failed to take responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to a witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the local community who courageously informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to our neighbors and at the same time carry a message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three of the tenant’s sons who lived in the house at different times were around 20 years old.
Polluted mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove the rubbish that has been dumped around the house
In 2014, she robbed the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of class B drugs that she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was intended to build a house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her exile partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evacuate tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow of the Denova and Cornwall police said the removal was sending a clear message to other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave impunely, and those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The Denova and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and unsocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after low flight of military jet aircraft over beach
Tourists enjoying the sunshine in Aveiro, Portugal, were scared to death
The P-3C Orion flight of the Portuguese Air Force
The Air Force said it was an exercise flight and insisted that there was no threat to security.
When a low-flying jet drove over a crowded beach, a panic struck the scared tourists.
The dramatic footage shows how a military aircraft reaches a distance almost to the touch of sunbathing people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of the jet aircraft engines, without seeing what emerged from the clouds.
The incident occurred on the Costa Nova in the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreators who posted video footage of the dramatic flight on social media, said: “The plane flew two times really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on Aveiro beach were shocked when a low-flying plane appeared from the dark
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on an exercise flight to identify a fishing vessel off the coast and had to get low because that was the only way to check the vessel.
The plane allegedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires.
Forest fires have devastated part of mainland Portugal this summer, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from fires that prevented him from seeing the flight.
The aircraft was on an exercise flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with the regulations.
Half of enterprises do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) found this during checks in the second quarter.
Funeral services most often do not inform the survivors about their prices or issue a written confirmation of acceptance of the order.
The court imposed 41 fines in the total value of SEK 73,000.
This was by her spokesman Jiří Fröhlich.
Inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified meter.
Therefore, the inspection prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of SEK 7077.
It concerned packaging for urns, covers for candles and vases that were not properly labelled with mandatory information.
“Given the fact that there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the inspection will continue in the next quarter of this year,” Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
It was that Kadiza Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the family had learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Rakka, the group’s bastion in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she prepared to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing—such as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with traveling to a war zone—is that it will discourage people from ever making decisions,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that they had married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and were widowed within a few months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference call on Thursday that he believes Clinton will choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid's spokeswoman later said he hadn't talked directly with Clinton about whether Garlanda would be nominated, and that he only speculated.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team’t want to “shake the ship” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who blocked Garland's appointment are "servants" and "pockets" of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is unfit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are “for both women and men”
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of revealing celebrities, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Obviously he thinks the calendar too.
“We need to return to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of women’s bodies,” Shaw said in a press release to the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during the open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys gramofon plates?
Vinyl is loved by lonely men of middle age.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comment section with pear notes under the pseudonym All-Of-Of-Of-Of-Of-Of-Of-Of, we note that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed resurrection of gramofon plates is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of owning a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not even about accumulating enthusiastic fans – it’s all an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramofone plates are more likely to want to preserve their feelings (56 percent versus 53 percent) and love themselves (69 percent versus 66 percent).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were to be broadcasted as a television report, the camera would watch me as I jump into the busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gestured widely.
So let’s look at it.
While its charm and charm are slowly disappearing from the heart of Soho—buildings once occupied by independent dealers are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing and office supplies—a few fantastic specialized gramofon stores still remain.
I’d probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while.I’ll stand close to the different men in these shops and try to spot their age and emotional mood.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and runs through shops to fill out a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
“I think yes,” he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand records.
All those recordings flanked the walls of his living room – in the picture above (the photo he sent me by email, I didn’t follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramofon plates he could not afford when they were originally released, and again he buys what he sold in his youth and didn’t have a wind.
“Much of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s.These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12, then I was too young and couldn’t get them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts, who like the company of themselves, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks the number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave.People who heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old gramofone plates back.
According to my interviews, people dropped their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramofone plates and bought CDs now sell their CDs to buy their gramofone plates back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of gramofon plates lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramofon plates?
It doesn’t take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a pleasant community of like-minded people in music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are upset by the contactless payment system.
Some gramofon fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of gramofon packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” Wez says.
I am a collector myself, so is it with me, and I think with a lot of people, too.
It’s an easy way to fill the space in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” says a collaborator from a pile of gramofon plates.
An ICM survey in April revealed that 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of those surveyed have a gramofon that they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramofon plates do not have a gramofon.
At this point in the reporting he was probably looking seriously concerned when browsing through the pile of bossa nova compilations.
The aspect of “trophy” and revival of interest is something that Jonny (42) noticed, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came and said, ‘I don’t have a gramofon yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead’s record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
The percentage is not great, but it happens.
It’s more about a product page than about music.
People come to us and say, “I don’t have a gramofon.”
These are younger people, not the older, grown-up pubers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for gramofon desks, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are couples in the seventy, tourists taking photos, pubers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as it was in the stores before – the latest pop from Wild Beasts, full of synthesizers and sex, is good to see different customers from the speakers instead of pulling jazz.
None of them looks lonely, but you can hardly guess the intricate mental trauma of standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks for a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various gramofon plates at a discount.
She is one of those who looks at spending rather than spending.
According to her, she doesn’t make much money, so she doesn’t seem to consider collecting gramofon plates.
It costs a lot of money.
It’s easy to listen to music on a computer or something like that.But the gramofone plates have their charm...”, he breathes up with desire.
I can’t explain it – it’s unique.
My final stop is the store that allegedly inspired a new generation of gramofon lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I’m very fascinated by girls in tight jeans and I’m watching a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras.
On the left is the staircase, the wall of which is covered by the gramofon plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Maca: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the foundation of any average collection of gramofon plates.
No one is looking at them – just because they’re just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that you can’t reach them.
It’s a pure vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the Soho depths for more, there’s not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most is spent on the most luxurious goods, such as vinyl is definitely.
But while, according to my findings, YouGov’s results seem to be accurate – that is, at least in gramofon stores, they don’t take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that actually exist in gramofon stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He doesn’t spend his Thursday morning wandering around the Berwick Street disc stores, browsing the recordings, and avoiding looking at a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the back of nothing-thinking middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five meters.
French court refuses to demolish shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an order from the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During a trial this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in temporary restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for a few euros.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they mean fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations at the court said shops and restaurants are vital and that the free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide supplemental food for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial temporary shops and restaurants often provide shelter and food for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running the 72 temporary stores, but said the objections of the prefect of Calais were “completely understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said grocery stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the camp’s cafe, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals daily, lessons of English and French, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
The petition has been signed by more than 170,000 people.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old.”
The charity Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp, after a steep increase in arrivals during the summer, has risen to more than 9,000 - the highest ever.
He thought he was dead.
The ball is swallowing itself and volley balls.
“I’ve been able to train normally since March,” he said at the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What was you?
I had a bipolar pulmonary embolism, then because of it, and heart problems.
Because when I was at the universiade in Korea, I didn’t know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my skull for two years and I didn’t know about it.
It hurt me, nobody found me.
Then the crash went up.
There is a damaged vein in the jaw, it will hurt all the time, especially when it turns or the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
had had .
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I bleed tonight.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was completely cut out for five days.
I really thought I was dead in the woods, my girlfriend and family.
I have seen myself somewhere else.
How did you compare it?
I probably had to go through it, now it will only go up.
I know I have some problems with blood, that I need to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But everything can be done with it.
Just when I wanted to go back to the preparation of the Prabrami last year, there were still problems with the heart.
Now everything is okay.
Since March I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I feel physically better than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I look good, I know most of the guys.
I’m looking forward to another two foreigners coming.
Hopefully we’ll sit down humanly so that it fits us together.
Raise the mouth?
It has a reputation for being an outcast, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was eighth, now it is the second.
There is a new team, only a few players left.
It was the last in the extreme, so there is a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We’ll see after the first round who will be the winner, we probably won’t.
Is Brom the guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and has experienced a lot, he will think of a better place than the last.
But my arrival had nothing to do with him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I was a great friend and it was agreed that he would be here.
I will not say the name.
Mr. Brom finally arrived and I am pleased.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
It moves us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to hecu and I like to get a chance in a not so top team.
I’ve been in Příbrami for two years, but it’s a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned the foreigners, the Australian Boehm is already training in Ústí.
How does it look?
I know him by coincidence, at the universiade we played against each other in a group.
And a couple of times we talked there, sometimes we sat together after matches, so we already know each other friendly.
We defeated them 3:1, and I just kicked it off at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend.
The Americans and Brazilians are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with an American, he looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Have you contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I’m the recorder, that is, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everybody.
I immediately found out what the player is, I found on the internet how he plays, I saw some videos.
He’s pretty high, he’s jumping, he’s jumping.
We posted a few posts on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it will fit into us.
How do you look forward to recording number one?
I did not want to take anything else.
I’ll be twenty-four and I’m not going to change it.
I’d rather be in the center of things, I’d rather be in the center of things than someone else would be in the lead.
I probably’t want to play anymore if I’d be like a second recorder and devote myself to it all the time.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in Příbrami, when it didn’t go to Kust as a captain, he injured himself, then there were problems with money and he left.
Since then, we’ve been up and I’ve been playing.
In the box I was in, I changed number one and number two.
It was a great year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose just Příbram.
From there, the Budějovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it is a new beginning.
Gold Number 22.
The short sofa remains Phelps's domain.
"To be on the winner's ranks again and to hear the anthem is sweet as always," Phelps laughed, with his eyes filled with tears again.
His fiancée and mother were again cheering in the watchground, his son Boomer was sleeping quietly this time with his headphones on his ears.
I have an incredible week at the end of my career.
It’s crazy – I started racing swimming 20 years ago and in a few hours it’ll be over, he said touchingly.
In the final, Phelps was two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long halfway.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Cup.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four games in a row.
Phelps was headed by another American Ryan Lochte and home Thiago Perreira.
While the defense of gold in the final 50's crashed to the overwhelming finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremony, he entered the final of the 100 meters butterfly race.
The legend could not shadow even compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won a signature double - after a hundred won in Rio and a double track.
In the final, he left Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin with 37 points, while Russian Yevgeny Rylov finished third.
While Murphy is only fifth out of 200 at last year’s World Championships, he became the king of signs in Rio de Janeiro.
The throne was removed by Larkina, who achieved the same double at last year’s World Championship.
At the Olympics, he won a medal.
The gold medal was won by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, this was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuel, the second after silver from the squad.
She won the gold at the Olympics as the first African American in history.
I can be an inspiration for others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport will become love for them and they will get to where I am, Manuel said.
Third was Sweden's Sarah Sjöström, who won the world record in the 100 meters butterfly race in Rio de Janeiro and still has the silver from the two-hundred.
Sixth was Australian Cate Campbell.
Japanese Rie Kanet won the first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
She has no precious metals even from the World Championship, her maximum was a fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio de Janeiro was won by Russian Julija Jefimov, who, despite a doping past, has been struggling with the hostility of the spectators and rivals due to the start at the Games.
I once made a big mistake.
But I won the trial and I don’t know why I should always answer these questions.
I am very tired of it, the Russian swimmer said.
The right to start in Rio was won by a special panel of the CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They handled my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or does not, or if they have a different opinion, let them go to the arbitration court.
We were disappointed, we could have won.
Start at midnight?
I do not remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
A little over an hour before the match, they knew who they were going to face.
They had to handle tactical preparations.
And then, at an unusual time, the game started on small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the opponent’s advantage, but they did not manage the finish at 19:19.
In the second they were clearly better and equal, but the decisive tie-break did not come out for them.
In particular, a number of damaged servers meant a loss at 10:15 and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
“We could have defeated the Russians,” Hermann regretted.
How would you assess the match?
After an unfortunate start before playing, we got into the game.
At the end of the day, I got the last balloon that I used to.
We lost the set, which was crucial.
In the next set, we entered them with a view on the pitch, a different defense, and we pushed on the service.
In the tie-break, there were terribly damaged submissions, there we went on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have defeated the Russians.
It was a shame at the start of the first set, so we got away.
We were able to remove it, but the points were missing.
The second set was great and the third was serviced.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and it was about the five, there we hesitated a lot.
It’s a pity, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the 1st game?
Same as in China on the side courts.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
It was one o’clock in the night, complete silence, no music played, nothing.
This is a difference to the center.
We can’t choose, but we can’t choose.
How did you prepare for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started training for the match without knowing the counter players, so we couldn’t do the tactical preparation for the other teams.
But Simon (Coach Nausch) prepared a tactic for almost all the options there were.
He had prepared a lot of papers with tactics, so after this page we were quite well prepared.
Do you ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half eleven, but not at twelve.
Bloc of Russia Birlov in the play-off in Rio de Janeiro.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in an embrace in the play-off in Rio de Janeiro.
Was it uncomfortable?
Sluková: By playing the last two matches in the group from ten, we had the regime shifted earlier.
This was two hours longer.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to deliver their best performance at twelve o’clock.
But I think we prepared as best we could.
We knew it would be so, but it’s not typical and it probably won’t be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from the group was our goal, it’s okay on one side, good.
We did what we said.
After the game, I am sad.
I'm going to sleep out of it and from tomorrow I'll remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, the first spinning SIM is coming.
You will not escape her.
The new rules will apply to all persons without a Thai passport who choose to purchase a SIM from one of the local operators while staying in Thailand.
This applies not only to tourists, but also to persons with long-term visas who, for example, work or have married in Thailand.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan for the sale of SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The new measures, which will allow monitoring of their location, are intended to be implemented within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means to preserve national security, which will enable to address criminal activities committed by foreigners.
In addition, tourist SIMs help to detect people who exceed the allowed duration of stay.
Within six months, special SIMs for foreigners will also be available in Thailand.
The function of tracking will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It will not be able to turn it off.
"This feature is not for the SIM for the Thai because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
In Thailand, subscriptions are not as anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires a document of identity.
For several years, one of the operators distributed a free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering the same measure as Thailand.
Sim registration is mandatory, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the proposed measures do not mean that foreigners are obliged to purchase a local SIM operator when entering the country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
After crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their network, operators in a given country only know the relevant network information.
Therefore, they know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to local tariffs is so large that even most tourists start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The attempt by the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners has received immediate criticism from foreigners legally living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy protection, compares the system to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order to monitor a particular person if necessary.
Any misuse of the system will be punished.
"If a service provider tracks the SIM location without a court order, it will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not logged into the network, it could be renewed after 15 days if you leave Thailand.
The luxurious apartment in the new building on Vinohradech has a swimming pool and a spa on the terrace.
Why did you choose a new apartment?
We are looking for an apartment where most of the property will be handled by the owner.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention the problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floating the floor, high energy consumption and the like.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
More interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior was designed by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamil Poláková from the Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert?
We would recommend working with an architect to anyone who is designing an apartment from the outset, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second plane is the interior design itself: designers have a substantially better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client’s wishes, are able to match the interior appropriately.
We collaborated with architect Lenka Langer already on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us in the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrad.
What are your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social and residential space with the appropriate background for a four-member family conceived as a modern, but not a cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and to implement the intelligent control of the home.
Of course, the quality of the work had to be monitored.
Have you left everything to the experts, or have you interfered with the final shape of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we determined what we expect from the design and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karel Malich, Karel Vysušil, Václav Špály or Otto Gutfreund helped the architect to orient in our taste.
Also the combination of black, white and nuts wood was the idea of the architect as well as the individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. Whether everything fits together, we then jointly verified by means of visualizations.
Were there any complications during the implementation, which made you have to give up the original ideas, or, on the contrary, to take on new ones?
Per only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the time when it was first possible to climb up to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned actually shaded the surrounding building.
We literally changed the situation overnight.
A granite was used on the kitchen line and on the wall of the fireplace.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented with leather, such as the carpeting of Arper’s Norma dining and bar chairs.
How would you describe the interior?
Are you planning a change or is there something you would like to do differently today?
I think it is a modern air interior, which first and foremost fulfils its purpose.
Changes are not planned, most of the adjustments after the relocation took place in the plane of shading and housing terraces.
Per the only complaint is to the floor, when nuts wood appears to be too delicate for a house with a dog.
Arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the implementation.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new disposal solution and several other modifications within the building.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light conductors on the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This brings daylight into the darkest areas of the apartment.
Also the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the functioning of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a bathroom.
In comparison to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in southern France, just off the Spanish border.
I moved a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France and then got to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel like I was in France.
I just didn’t want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere.
Every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are generally negative, but it has worsened lately.
Interestingly, you are talking about negativity.
This is how some people view the Czech people.
Unfortunately, compared to the French, they are not bad.
Some people may not get it when they come to France because they don’t see it as a tourist.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel like they have little money, but the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
There is also a problem with the behavior of Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street I lived in, my non-Muslim neighbor looked at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
As if I was evil.
I didn’t feel well in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and found a vacant job at Air France here in Prague.
I must admit that I didn’t know the prairie at the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what happened in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague at all.
I’ve been here for three years now and I can’t imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t catch any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like there are more free people here.
I can do anything, wear anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you unpleasantly, such as when you have strange clothes and the like.
I felt really free in Prague.
I don’t think the people care about such things.
Where are you working now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then, a friend and I set up a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
For now, we only operate in Prague, but we would like to expand it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half-Czech, and two other friends are Czech.
I have to say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that they are more distant at first.
He doesn’t let anyone get to his body.
It’s quite different from where I grew up.
Everyone hugs and kisses each other in the face.
It’s different here, but I understand that it’s a cultural matter, so I try to adapt.
You said you don’t speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem?
In Prague, it’s pretty easy because everyone speaks English.
Even in dinner or food.
I want to learn English, but I don’t have enough time.
And by everyone being able to communicate in English at least a little, I don’t have such a need to learn the language quickly.
Every time I have a problem, someone can help me.
Have you encountered any negative reactions?
Maybe because you’re a Muslim?
Basically not.
Per it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
It quite touched me.
But that anyone had a problem with being a Muslim, it hasn’t happened to me.
And that even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, that I would be fooled.
The anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
The problem is that anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence.
For me, those who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur’an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves by your faith?
It is very difficult.
I feel shy and guilty, even though I shouldn’t feel that way.
I try not to follow the news of violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that is not my fault.
I am a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in the square of Jiří z Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Muslims and Christians demonstrated against the violence.
Have you registered it?
I did not know about that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don’t think they would have to do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn’t do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religiously based than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because each of us perceives it a little differently.
I came from France, so I went through a different education, they taught Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordination of women.
How do you see it?
I do not feel subordinate in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
This also means that you don’t wear a head cover.
As for the hijab?
It’s mainly about the way I was raised.
My mother is really a Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she doesn’t wear a shirt.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Qur’an, you should make your own opinion.
So when I read a passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and if I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the shirt is required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far yes.
I didn’t feel so well anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is an ideal city for that.
Muslims and Christians protest against violence.
Kozelskaya Fencl was hit by the wind in Rio.
On Friday, on the sea in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Czech yachter Veronica Kozelská Fencl went out.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to 10th place before the final two runs.
This would ensure the Czech participation in the final race.
Collect packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of shipments is the television director Matěj Liška and the manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they inspired three applications with different geographical scope.
We launched the national application in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities that are recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big a package you can carry and how much you want.
Somebody may be asking for transportation that day.
When the route and delivery time fit, it matches and both will receive mutual notification.
At that moment, a chat opens, where the two agree to surrender.
How many people would you estimate would have to register so that every package would always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't guess how many registered and how many routes are needed to make the coverage completely optimal and each offer matched with the demand.
On the main roads it already works and it is logically easier than on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building confidence and finding that no one will escape with the package.
Do you have to deal with such a case?
How many users does the service have after two months of launching?
We currently have about 5 to 6 thousand people creating roads.
We consider this to be a success and hope there will be more.
Shouldn’t the sender wait too long?
We hope to be a competitor for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the thing even the same day and at a fraction of the price.
In a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You’ll pay a hundred dollars or less, because that’s the way someone is already doing.
Should Traditional Carriers Worry About Possible Customer Loss in the Future?
We hope it will be so.
The market has enormous potential, huge multinational carriers are fed here, as well as retail chains, where they all started shopping and gradually discovered that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find a ticket in the mailbox with a message that he has to pick up the shipment at the branch, not earlier than the day after 7 p.m.
At that time, I needed the package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not bother anyone and send a signal to the competition, let it try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39)
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they began preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses already planned journeys between world metropolis, mainly by aircraft, to transport packages.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
Programming lasted three quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
The app began to develop in December last year and was released in May this year.
This is a local version of the Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Moon and Moon Profi app has been developed since January this year and was made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which one day will merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to adjust the app and then focus more on the global market in cooperation with a strong investor.
Shared economy is a topic lately and this is a service such as Airbnb or Uber.
Are you not worried about operating in an area that no one can tell, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It’s the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to bypass the tax authorities and tax controls.
Every user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make income from it.
Why do you think the company has so much potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respectively, reduces travel costs.
This is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the era of social networks that divide people, we would like this to get closer.
There can be good stories, people are happy to have helped someone and will tell about it.
For example, someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been lacking personal approach for a long time, about this app we say that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you ensure that the courier does not drop the package?
Each user of the app, together with the registration, scans a citizen’s ID card and specifies a bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give service and man credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on the ratings of the senders.
We will also provide insurance, and we will provide the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in the event of loss or damage, but does not take responsibility according to criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and finds a rifle or ten kilos of hashish in a closed package in his suitcase, the criminal liability falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data?
The registered persons are, if necessary, searchable by the administrative authority, which is the only one who will have the opportunity to view them, nor are we able to see them, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money will the courier receive when the shipment is successfully delivered?
The courier determines the price and receives the entire amount he says.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for mediating contact.
This money is our profit, but it’s only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
No one can accuse the courier that he did not deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, both receipt and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can move anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cubicle of butter, medium as a plate of eggs, and large as a bass of beer.
After that, there are no further restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, take a refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option of taking a picture of the package in the app, so that the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even need to pack the stuff if you don’t want to hide the content.
You put the forgotten shirt in the courier’s hand and that’s it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to launch the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, then I didn’t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo app with a transnational reach that is mainly aimed at airline passengers.
At that moment, I told him that I would not be looking for an investor, but I would like to become an investor myself and put my savings into it.
It took another year for development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London for greater credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused on marketing in the Czech Republic, where we try to pick up the app, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to customer feedback and we do not address the foreign market at the moment.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t cheer, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were somehow upgraded.
The overhead was created when we said that the domestic segment could be far more interesting and that we will at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application by the Moon is local, for the city.
It can send a package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transceiver, but the difference is that as a courier you can see the shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile phone.
The app for couriers who want to feed on it, we called the Month Profi.
So, can anyone earn money by picking up packages around the city?
Exactly, the last app will be downloaded in Prague, such as a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
Now that all of these Pokémon are like Pokémon, they can get the same stuff.
You see where in the city there are orders, come to it, click and see when it needs to be delivered and take over the shipment.
This is cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment we are still making a web interface, which will be key for companies to send mail, fill in data about them on the web, or create points on the map.
We are then able to charge them for the use of the service, for example, every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It makes us stressful, but we normally have it at work so that we can live and develop the project.
We’re not behind a strong multinational investor, we’re two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other got into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to handle the Czech market with us, but who should go with us into a global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is about to bring a almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second episode and the solo game in it will be more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is based on the concept of networking in the first part.
Therefore, you can enjoy the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to action passages, the game will also contain levels focused on agile movement.
They will resemble platforms and include rebuses.
To overcome them are therefore essential, for example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slide.
Sometimes even enemies need to be destroyed.
There will be no shortage of maps reminiscent of labyrinths and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and remove platforms and close large doors.
Adjusting this way you will be the form of a battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments for exploring an unknown planet.
Jack Cooper dreams of becoming a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimosa, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy troops.
Nor will the wilderness be compassionate to him.
In addition, Lastimosa is injured in a crash, and Cooper is assigned the task of operating Captain’s Titan.
His dream of a pilot career will be fulfilled sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed for the robot’s repair.
Cooper’s talks with Titan will also be important.
Players will be used as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, the robotic isolated communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium will dry out list all the injuries that Cooper threatens in a planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought Polygon server.
The result will be available in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 comes out on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand is resurrected, but the original publishing company remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the publishing company in 2013, THQ acquired a number of its brands and the right to use its logo and company name.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
There are 23 new games for the publishing company, 13 of which have not yet been revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I was retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a man twenty years younger, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning – first she apparently tried it for a long time, then they put together.
He’s such a big guy, probably her type, because she’s been with a similar one before me.
She completely went crazy about him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girllike, loving voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I observed it all.
He then went out of work regularly at half-four, so she always went out at three for shopping.
Every day she tried to see him.
Later I found out that they met with him in the cabin, in the laundry room.
How many times I knew they were there.
I got the keys and decided to catch them.
I don’t know why, but I always stayed at home.
I have never been able to go there, to take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me.
Soon she realized that I was controllable, that I would do what she wanted.
And I really did it.
Maybe I’m just such a bitch.
My neighbors told me they knew that too.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only my daughter knew.
So I always postponed it, on and off.
One day I went to his house and asked him if I needed help in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he is dating my wife and that he indicates everything.
I asked him what he would say to me.
He stood there, shrugging his shoulders, staring at the ground and not saying a word.
Then I also at that time one time met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn’t believe it.
She did not respond to it, nor did she say anything to me.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I am such a person who has never gone anywhere, who has trouble getting to know someone, let alone find a woman.
I didn’t even think about divorce.
I always believed it would end someday.
I thought I would forgive her and her life would go on.
It was not so.
I have basically never coped with all of this.
I still have it in me.
I used to tell her about it many times before, but eventually I let it go for peace.
He still lives in the next house and I still live with her.
She is more like my housewife than my wife.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She is working.
She always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
It can also be said that she is good.
But sometimes I want to kiss her, to embrace her, and she won’t let go.
We go for a walk and shopping together and everyone thinks we have a happy marriage.
She told me she never loved me.
She loved me, but she didn’t love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, that he is her God.
I am tired of such life.
Already when it started and I was very bad at it, I once told her I didn’t want to live and I asked what she would say to it if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that’s what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
She thought and finally said, “But there’s plenty of room here.”
French Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants a new Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the country and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France intensifies its fight against radical Islamists and calls on the government and the local Muslim minority to help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who undermine public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual educated people in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where priests who are vaccinated with jihad often come with money.
In October, France’s prime minister will set up a new Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the country and its Muslim population.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
At that time, it had to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that fund their construction.
But soon it was hit by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Minister of the Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of a secular state.
There are approximately 2,500 mosques and prayer halls in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen others are considering this move.
This week, German police also attacked the jihadist clergy.
Imams allegedly recruited fighters for Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked a Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the January 2015 attacks on Charlie Hebdo, there was a debate in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was accelerated by further terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to provide financing for mosques from domestic sources and also to oversee imams.
It is not yet clear where the funding will be obtained, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special tax on halal foods, i.e. primarily on meat from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by halal food vendors for granting permits.
Part of the money goes to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who travel to Mecca.
Approximately 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia from France each year.
In addition, only preachers who have completed educational programs at French universities should be allowed to work in French mosques.
Thus, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also closing radical mosques.
“Since December, we have closed 20 of them and more will follow,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect our country's principles, such as equality between women and men," he said.
by Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Zaragoza, the newspaper Independent reports.
The shooting occurred after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping center, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned his gun against himself, reports The Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital uninjured daughter, for the man in critical condition had to arrive an ambulance.
The attack took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish news agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the recent unresolved divorce of the two partners.
Wipes with spinach, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well digestible food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smells of barbecues, strawberries, pork strawberries.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even sometimes except salad or roasted vegetables.
True, barbecue is time-saving and dishes-saving, moreover, it is a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to how to do well with delicacies that make eating a special meal, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fried or squeeze for a long time.
This will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is domestic sushi or sashimi, where high-quality raw materials and a couple of well-adopted griffs will be enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic delight.
Like even easier rolls in rice paper from today’s recipe.
This is the time-consuming process of cooking and cooling rice.
The paper can only be soaked into the water for a moment, and then it only depends on the chef's imagination how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
It’s not like a riot.
The advantage of a variety of Asian foods today is that the raw materials are already commonly available.
Including sweet-acid ginger, which is one of the basic tastes accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but true pink ginger has a unique spicy sharpness and a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several species of vinegar and ginger.
It is enough to buy a suitcase of the appropriate size, and the appendix with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
The banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate dishes in various ceremonial occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed leaves of the banana tree are very widespread in a number of countries in Asia or South America as a "help" for the preparation of various baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packed into them similarly to the alobal.
The banana leaf gives the food a specific taste.
They can be purchased in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut in the shape of wheels.
Choose only green leaves, and therefore healthy - unbreakable and without stains.
Similarly easy is the preparation of a salad from wakame algae, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be purchased frozen again.
Those who often eat or prepare sushi, probably will know especially the algae nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves – thus plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, who would not know the miso soup with wakame, allegedly used by Asian women for a long time to recover from childbirth.
The effect is almost miraculous.
It purifies the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even supposedly prevents hair greening and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and roasted wakame also serves as a spice, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first laid out in water, then rinse, put into boiling water and boil for half a minute.
Afterwards, they are cooled in ice water, cut out the middle ribs and further adjusted, for example, as a favorite salad.
Buying it ready and frozen is the easiest solution.
Therefore, it remains only to wrap the roll with easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy tastes.
A bomb of longevity.
If you resist and do not hit the grilled beetle.
Eat healthy and easy in the summer.
The Asians know how.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh meal that delightfully combines tastes.
Finished once two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 grams of carrots, 40 grams of white radish, 100 grams of green spinach, 60 grams of salad cucumbers, 60 grams of wakame algae and 60 grams of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of cut koriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of roasted gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First we prepare the roofs.
Put the rice paper in cold water for 5 seconds.
Then we remove it and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, we briefly boil the spinach shoots, and after about three minutes we quickly cool them into ice water so that they do not lose their color.
Put vegetables on permitted paper and pack.
We prepare the filling from white radishes, carrots and salad cucumbers, which we cut into fine nuts, mix them with a sweet chilli sauce, add cut koriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we insert shrimp shrubs, add wheels and, at the end, decorate the whole dish with wakame algae, sliced ginger, a slice of manga, drizzle with black sesame and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain has to be satisfied with silver in Seven Rugby, Fiji selection takes gold
Britain’s impressive performance in seven-piece rugby ended with a devastating mark on the last obstacle, with Fiji beating the British in the final match on Thursday evening at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians showed master lessons in processing, landfilling, folding, supporting play, running on lajna and brutal force – and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with a reckless consolation prize in the form of a silver medal – the third for Britain on a given day – and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic Seven-rate rugby tournament, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The overwhelming win over South Africans 7:5 in the semi-final the same day may have frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would be defeated by a 15-member team in full health.
It may not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around the neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Britain has gone a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, the Adelaide Sevens lost every match.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji started spectacularly, the British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his fellow players, it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and the World Cup champions drove 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was.
12:0 and England had a hard time touching the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed the Fijians.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after the return and there was still more than 1 minute left on the hours ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated over the Malat Britons and attacked the lajna, where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, there was a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
This is exactly how it is.
The British made massive changes after the halftime and stopped the Fijian offensive... for a whole long four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after a brilliant interplay Fiji Josu Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, throwing the touchdown in the left corner to raise the 36:7. but the match was long ago won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans were singing, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire the completely cheerful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the victory of the Fijians with another attempt.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged each other, and the British fell on the lawn completely stunned.
Earlier on the same day, Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals by 20:5 and Britain defeated South Africa in the close semi-finals - with a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown led the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his glamorous leg work, broke the defense line and scored under the hook in the second half.
The great late landing of Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from England’s 15 team, secured the victory – and eventually the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired by a coach's fight against cancer to win the windsurfing race
You won’t find more emotional gold on these Games – and that’s what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punitive breaths into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Even though there were two people sitting at the venue, there were three voices on the boat.When the boat waved over the surface in the face of the second Olympic gold in a race of women's pairs, there was still a voice on the boat with the coach Robin Williams.They are the first women in the history of British sports to such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see – two outstanding athletes flying on the water with the elegance of a lion – does not reflect the nature of victory altogether.
Behind every gold medal in windsurfing there is a battalion of help hands that make a difference, and no hand was more helpful than the hand of a coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would survive the day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
This would be a very bad situation.
This will change your view of things.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
Luckily for the whole trio, he was able to start treatment in early 2014, outside of the season, and reduce the loss to a minimum – if we can call it so under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to put up quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said a few steps were enough.
This is how it started.
Riding is a journey in itself, but this one was a bit more difficult.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to handle his own unrest.
Stanning, a captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who has a mission in Aghanistan, said: “I’ve been down with emotions this week, maybe it’s a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it emphasizes how much it means to me, how much we worked with Helen and Robin as well.
It’s been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
“Without Robin, we’t be anyone, so thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I could not have wanted a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
The two set up an overwhelming rhythm that their rivals couldn’t handle.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were very focused at the moment.
Helen shouted, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It is very important not to let yourself be taken away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to anything famous.
We didn't look forward to today's fireworks, we just wanted to hang out, go out and win the race, which we managed.
The couple will take a year to think before they decide what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, her next is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
He wants to enjoy that moment.
I didn’t say it would be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better,” she said.

The Prison?
Rather let them drive people for free, says the taxi hunter Rubeš to a breakthrough prosecution.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate officer in Prague are indicted.
You have made a series of reports in which you have uncovered fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will come before the court.
You have faced several unpleasant clashes with revealed actors.
How much is the report on the prosecution of members of an organized group breakthrough for you?
I thought there would be a trial.
I am curious about the verdict.
I don’t think they should be in jail.
It is useless.
They should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they will drive all people free of charge.
This is a somewhat selfish solution.
Does this mean that you do not see the penalty as effective enough?
For me, it’s enough that some of them are so afraid they don’t do the job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingla, another dispatches a pizza, and one completely discourages it.
The accused could be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
I have a problem with imprisonment.
I think this is a bad punishment.
To put someone in jail, especially in such cases, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the society what they took from them.
For a quarter of a century they committed the destruction of our country’s name and the robbery of people.
So let them now make a good visiting card and distribute people for free.
I cannot imagine it otherwise.
It would be a public benefit.
Like someone going to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they’ll eventually get a condition and they don’t care.
They will find a way to cheat.
He studied at the Miroslava Ondříčka Film Academy in Písk and subsequently at the University of Tomáša Bati in Zlín.
It belongs to people who started in the Czech Republic with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, and now prepares the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Those Rubeš in the form of short reports advises which services in Prague prefer to avoid and which, on the contrary, he recommends to use without worry.
He previously filmed series titled How to Do, City of Fraud, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prachy.
They are described as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxis be called mafia?
They are such cute maffians, not such as we know from Kmotra.
It’s more of a mafia – juniors, but they’re organized.
They’re just looking at each other’s taxi stations.
Prague is fragmented.
I traced out that, for example, the main station doesn’t like Paris, Paris doesn’t like taxi drivers waiting at the Karlovy Lázni (disco club).
Everyone just keeps his place, and each group is organized somehow.
Probably a broken network.
The accused are seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official who warned the driver of checks.
As you say, the unwanted phenomenon from the streets did not disappear.
What is the percentage of tax evaders in Prague, according to your estimate?
This is a very small percentage.
The worst people are on the street.
For example, I’m talking about Rihanna.
This is a man who is really dangerous – he carries a telescopic shovel in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Charles Bridge and carries people.
When I last walked with him, he wanted me seven hundred for three kilometers.
The police did not stop him for any reason.
There were only a few people from the whole group.
The same is true of other locations in Prague.
Therefore, the accusation of seven people will be difficult to remove the already famous Prague mess, which seems to have much larger dimensions.
Of course, it is absolutely useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be wiped out, that is true.
Are taxi drivers robbing foreign tourists still performing in the same places that you showed in the reports, at the Charles Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yes, exactly so .
In these locations they stand every day and every day they violate the decrees.
This is ignored by both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It is no longer a cat but a total indifference.
Taxi Drivers in Figures
However, some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will go to court.
It is already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and will always be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little better, I will continue to do so.
You need to press the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains there, we should still do something to remove him.
You cannot be satisfied with this.
But this is not the case, there are more of them.
Do you always try to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do test rides and I have to say that it’s still bad.
Just last week I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was a sum of 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal line).
He had a certificate, the police arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute and dumb that he was still following the police officers and asked them when someone would finally give him those 56 kroner.
A similar case.
A taxi driver stole a decimal line on a taxi and stole 357 kronor from tourists.
Can you say that the timidity of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not go away even after you showed the faces of those who charged meaningless amounts for a short ride in your footage?
Their timidity is still incredible.
What happened to the 56-course driver?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he issued a receipt.
And this will, I think, be the problem with that court (six taxis and one ex-officer).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his receipts, on the other side the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I filmed the pieces about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I’ve always wanted to use pictures, but I’ve always wanted to use them only for reporting.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver would be able to drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he’t feed on it.
You talked about the trick with a decimal line, which, especially in front of foreign clients, fraudulent taxi drivers are pushing.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they afraid to continue using this fig after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the program.
I recently drove with a taxi driver, boasting in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed a black cardboard on the side of the taxometer.
When I asked him what it had there, he said to me, “You know what it is.”
When taxis fraudsters were not fined too much, can a court with their colleagues impress them warningly?
Is there anything that can prevent them from cheating?
You say that you will always find a way to cheat.
I think nothing can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should fight more to get them out of there seriously.
From my experience I have to say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil their reputation?
They have taste, but they lack mind.
They don’t know much about it and can’t say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (due to the proposal for an area-wide restriction coming from the office of mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it wasn’t very clear what they wanted.
Once they said they didn’t protest against Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they just blocked Prague and created only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
In general, how do you assess the approach of the Prague magistrate in solving the problem of pricing?
Police had to intervene in order to resolve the matter.
The judge was short.
They had a moth there, which brought out information, that is, the taxi department was doing its job in vain for several years.
I hope that this official will be charged to the last check all the broken checks so that he realizes what he has done.
That will be the worst thing for me.
I even went on a check-in with him, which I found out only afterwards from their schedule.
A few months have passed since the last series was released.
What is the response?
I think mostly about foreign viewers, which is actually the most focused on the series.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I send them these videos.
And then when we walk around the Old Town Square, they are surprised to see that the same people who are seen on the footage really stand there.
Famous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I would build a plot around them so that people could look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
clearly .
I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are a lot of dispatches that are fair.
I’ve only taken a taxi on the street since then.
When I got into the car, the driver said, “You have the courage.”
Dressed as an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were recorded in 2005.
The former mayor Pavel Bém in the same year went on a check-in drive in a dressed Italian tourist and immediately on the first attempt the driver scammed him by two hundred.
But the editor Rubeš had worse experiences.
Taxi drivers charged him for a ride from Staroměstský to Václavské náměstí 820 CZK, which is approximately 195 CZK per kilometer, as calculated by the creators of the reports.
The Prague Supreme Court has imposed a maximum price of SEK 28 per kilometer.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed report: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Paris Street to Truhlářské cost a tourist 400 CZK.
There were also taxis waiting at the Karlovy Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers long, they charge as much as six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemicals and the longer, the better.
The impurities from it go well, although sometimes the dirt must be given down with a scalpel, it is necessary to dig it out of the folds.
It’s not easy and it’s not going to go fast, restorant Vanesa Trostová from Oldřichova in Hájě.
Hat down in front of it: the tomb is built with a layer, after which it is necessary to climb countless times and slide again.
“The restaurant manager should be careful, patient and unpretentious about the working environment,” she said.
This is not her first restoration work in Frýdlantsk.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frydlant city hall were restored, the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Zátiší, St. John Nepomucký in Frydlant, Pieta in Frydlant Okružná Street, Mariánský sloup in Frydlant and atlanta in the front of the baths in the New Town under the Smrk were restored.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kryštof and Catherine of Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the depth of dirt and crust, the loose stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; either they will be anchored into the wall or to each other.
Treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be re-golded.
“Then it will begin with the goldening of the inscriptions on the marble plates with raw sliced gold,” said Věra Sobotová, referent for the State Memorial Care of the City Office in Frydland.
There is no evidence that the tomb has been repaired.
At a closer glance, they will capture holes, drilled in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of a tomb decoration.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
The tombs were closed, Sabbath said.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a slight exaggeration like at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to repair the tombs that were underwater, the baptistry was restored, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
“We would also like to go to the glasses in the future,” said Sobotová.
The church is in very good condition and we invest in maintenance and repairs every year.
The restoration work on the restoration of the redernovsky tomb will cost a total of SEK 128,000.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not put any of its money into this part of the reconstruction.
A hundred thousand crowns will go just from the winning in the regional round of the contest Historical City of the Year 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, the mayor of Frýdlantu Dan Ramzer said.
The decision to release the prize for the restoration of the tomb was made by the council.
Experts’ opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets followed through indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) in the horizon of one month and a half.
Low volatility and growth dominate the markets.
Who would have said this at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which went through 12% adjustments in February, is today at a new historic high and has already paid 7% since the beginning of the year.
Again, this confirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of the central banks, which ultimately have always reached their goal.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at historic highs, volatility is again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when the markets have grown satisfied and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank and when the volatility index (VIX) has kept steadily below the 12 percent threshold.
And not to either.
Although the Fed continues to prepare the markets for a gradual rise in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing and last week the Bank of England, which will buy £70 billion in bonds over the next six months, also put a hand to the work.
The new wave of quantitative easing thus pushes already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
This is a question for a million.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to last in a similarly calm regime.
It’s a pity that Juncker doesn’t study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has taken on this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the head of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (a really experienced politician, because he was overwhelmed by so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) as the European Commission’s chief negotiator of the conditions of Britain’s exit from the EU.
Juncker’s choice sparked signs of hopes that it is in the EU’s serious interest to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media accepted Barnier’s name as Juncker’s act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
They hate Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He understood it as only he could understood it: a fierce enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A supporter of multilateral regulations was a co-author of the concept of a so-called banking union, and he was disgusted with everything that comes from London’s City Financial Center, promoting legislation of overwhelmingly tough regulations of the financial sector and services.
Thus, this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a tough, relentless and apparently ruthless negotiator.
Probably not good news.
In this context, how can we not remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the discretion, insight and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, the Czechs and the Slovaks can be closest friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be for the good of all!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin ruler has released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin fired Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno.
This was by Russian media with reference to the Kremlin press service.
Putin has said that Ivanova will be fired at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossija 24, the president said he was meeting Ivanov’s wish when he took office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report of the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov’s current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is one of Putin’s closest associates.
The former KGB officer, for example, served as defense minister and deputy prime minister in the past.
He is now leaving the chair of a member of the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov, in a meeting with Putin, said he was actually a record-breaking man by the length of his stay at the head of the administration of the head of state.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already shifted from this position.
Kvitová and Uncle Deblistová will not play the final.
So far, none of Friday’s tennis matches have managed to turn into a final.
Petra Kvitova was the first to lose the fight, succumbing to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
A short time later, the Czechs were followed by Aunt Safarivá.
The defeaters of the Williams sisters in the first set went on to win, but they missed two sets and the Russians eventually scored the set in a shortened game.
They lost the second set with a ratio of 4:6.
Half-success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech windsurfing: ski farmer Ondřej Synek with overview won his semi-finals, when the second Damir Martin from Croatia defeated despite the abstinence in the end almost a second.
The weather was good, the wind was calm.
I tried to save as much as I could, he said.
Unlike his opponents, he had to fight.
So they took some strength, and it could be easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing cards for me, said the wheelchairman of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková did not walk in the Snykových footsteps.
The thirty-five-year-old windsurfer occupied the fourth position in her ride in the semi-final today, and on Saturday she is waiting for the start in the B final and the fight for the 7th to 12th place.
London’s gold isn’t worth it.
It was the first time I didn’t go to the Olympics.
I’m a bit sorry, but on the other hand I ran a good race and put my best in it.
The opponents were just better, the Topinková Knapková bowed in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed she would be among the elite six in her fourth games.
He gave up just before his goal.
I knew that the girls were balanced, that anyone could advance from that field.
I was surprised that a Chinese woman had such a finish.
And I thought I could get through the Australian to the final.
Unfortunately, today was a life race, said the world champion of 2011.
Far behind the final goals in Rio remained the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to break out of qualification for the second time, this time a miscarriage in the lie.
He took the 33rd place.
The best results were for the Russians.
Sergey Kamensky took the first place with 629 points and Kirill Grigorjan with 628.9 points.
Nepejchal’s score was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the program in Rio for the first time, including Czech seven-ballers Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Caches belong to the 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
The lead is British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, along with Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both teams achieved the best performance in the history of the Seven Bowl.
They tried to jump 200 inches, but failed.
German or Russian, who is worse?
If we look away from the absurdity of this question: German society has undergone a profound self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In the twentieth century, dictators arose in the two great Eurasian nations, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and terrible.
The Russian Bolsheviks from 1917 to 1989 contributed largely to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetent warfare or inhumane experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly exterminated about 6 million Jews and the total victims of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, German and Soviet atrocities were carried out.
Neither in Germany nor in the USSR, only a few individuals were to blame, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by cowardice or by striking their heads into the sand.
This is not just the particularity of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany immediately the end of the war came denasification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, Daddy, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were primarily concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealist) goals, but they definitely don’t want to rejoin Alsace-Lothringen or attack someone – for revenge – militarily – that’s probably recognized by everyone.
In the aftermath of the Cold War in Russia, there was no such thing.
The window of possible positive changes was definitively closed at the turn of the millennium when former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated today in Russia.
Putin’s policy of Russia is revenge, conquest of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and the future of their own people are of no value to the peacock.
Be yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from growing tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the area of Crimea has deteriorated.
Who benefits from increasing tension?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia have deteriorated again.
The pretext for the Ukrainian side was the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
The reports from both opposing sides are, of course, contradictory and it is difficult to verify them independently, so we have the opportunity to only think about the old known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there were terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenko known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we approach the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from the worsening of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: Nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, on the backdrop of the immigration crisis to Europe, attention has shifted from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost credit to its inhabitants, when the current support for President Poroshenko is around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have been bankrupt long ago without generous financial injections from the EU and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to again strongly draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces are once again trying to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who try to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both hostile sides and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest level in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2 percent was announced.
The average annual inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0%, the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0,2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in travel of the following consumer goods groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1,7%), transport (1,8%), culture and recreation (6,3%), restaurants and hotels (1,2%), other goods and services (0,3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2 per cent), furniture, household appliances and conventional maintenance (0.5 per cent), healthcare (0.1 per cent).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained.
The U.S. has been monitoring Russian hackers for a year.
Information about Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic party headquarters.
There is no official report on Russian involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was strictly classified because its disclosure would reveal that the US intelligence services are monitoring the hacking attack and could reveal how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The material on the Russian footprint was encrypted and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Public officials were informed only by a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called in the U.S. gang of eight.
It consists of the heads of both houses, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, Democratic chairmen of both houses, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of Congressional defense and security committees.
Democratic leader Donna Brazile announced on Thursday that she is setting up an advisory body on cybersecurity to “prevent future attacks and provide first-class protection for Democratic Party servers.”
In the smoked Albert salmon was a dangerous parasite.
The chain apologized.
On the basis of the consumer's incitement to health problems after consuming the food Losos wild smoked - pieces of 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygienists carried out a check in the Albert stores in Václavský náměstí and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that the L23012562/T4 batch with the expiration date of 22.11.2016, which was notified by the customer, was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiration date of 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory tests confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp.
This is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
The latter is dangerous for humans – larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen, and the living larvae ingested by humans can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs.
We apologize to our customers for the problems with this product.
We immediately withdrew this batch from sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
The mistake occurred on the part of the supplier with whom we negotiate, and at the same time we let this product be tested by ourselves, said Albert Barbora Vanko, a spokesman for Novinky.
If the customer has purchased this product, they can return it at any of the stores in the chain and receive a refund.
Larvae will destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Return.
About the occurrence of the hazardous product hygienists informed the Prague and Central Czech Veterinary Administration.
According to the server safetyfood.cz people after consuming the parasite can become ill with anisakiasis, which will manifest with sharp abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can proceed asymptomatically.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after eating insufficiently heated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient thermal processing of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have now checked the salmon at the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Czech Republic.
Three out of five tested samples had the parasite.
A shipment of 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Vyexpedited, in the overwhelming majority to the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
Currently there is a withdrawal of unsold inventories of the product from the stores, said on Friday the CTC spokesman of SVS Petr Pejchal.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples banned the sending of additional products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman attempted to escape from Rakka, believed to have been killed by a Russian raid.
After the initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, there came the exaggeration.
The anticipated paradise of the caliphate turned into a hell on earth for British girls, from which there was no escape.
The girl was in contact with her sister Halima, according to relatives.
She repeatedly called her to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraza.
They are ordered to shoot without consideration, The Telegraph quoted the lawyer of the family of the deceased girl, Tasnim Akunjee, as saying.
The last tracks led to Raqqa, from there the girl spoke for the last time.
There was a report of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family contacted her from an apartment in East London.
Together, they discussed how she could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
He hoped to meet his former student again.
Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, as the house she was staying in collapsed in May with the ground bombing, ITV News.
Television added that the bomb was probably dropped by a Russian aircraft that attacked a bastion of ISIS in Syria.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer, said.
In the week when she was thinking about escaping from Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was publicly beaten to death.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to take any risks, according to the BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amir Abas went on a trip on February 17.
At home, they said they were going out.
They headed to Gatwick Airport and passed through Turkey to ISIS-controlled territory.
The girl’s family, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadizu back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area and this family did everything they could, pushing all their forces to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without the risk of being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza may serve as a deterrent case for other girls or even boys who let themselves be deceived by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people went there, realized how things are there, understood how far it differs from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return,” Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadyzin’s classmates is unknown.
But as they also remain silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
In prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go out of jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the district center and the residence of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall and the basement underneath the hall served as a local prison.
Conditions in which the prisoners lived were deplorable and many prisoners attempted to escape.
Many of them successfully.
Therefore, the city council decided to move the premises of the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more prisoner-friendly, with heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, its closure occurred for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as smaller repair equipment was expensive to operate and did not pay too much.
Stories of prisoners and ghost hunts.
Opened to the public a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in time costumes enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room to see where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly for a photo of a monument, or to give a clue to the feeling that prisoners experience behind the grids.
Inveraray prison is one of the most famous sites in Scotland where it is said to be scary.
Several groups of paranormal activity hunters have gone there, and the museum still allows people to come hunt some ghosts.
This night will cost £300, which is approximately £9,500.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
“Animé” effect on Snapchat is criticized as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by an animé, but some observers say it’s racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border with absurdity.
You can make an ananas, a dog, or a figure that appears to have emerged from the painting of Roye Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any error will be announced immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have been criticized in the past by allegations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin shades as a beauty ideal.
So when it offered users a filter this week that made them have sloppy eyes, curved teeth and bloated faces, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians – “yellowface.”
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions did not point to a greater problem of society – the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it and the news and outrage spread rapidly and Snapchat said the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a speech account to the anime characters, not as a cartoon of the Asians.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes in action.
Others rejected comparisons with the animé.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon with the filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not just about the yellowface, but that the yellow face is touched to the detestable extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless battle of diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting halls to Hollywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — may mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, “it’s very difficult for these things to go unnoticed today, as it was before.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she is convinced that racially motivated issues reflect the lack of diversity in Snapchat’s recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the overwhelming white, entirely male leadership of the company, and the article ended with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity between employees and colored people at the time when decisions are made,” said Zhu, who is Chinese-American, “or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk.”
Other observers share her point of view – a complaint Snapchat has left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees by having the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the underrepresented population and on internal inclusion management.
Zhu added: “I’m curious if they really need more such users who can say it’s not okay,” with their account being cancelled.
Army officers have distorted intelligence information about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released Thursday that officers from the U.S. headquarters changed intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what events from the country provided.
According to a preliminary report by a working group drafted by the Republican Chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, there has been “large dissatisfaction” among central intelligence analysts that their superiors have changed their assessment of U.S. efforts to defeat Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence outcomes approved by senior Centcom officials typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than what was confirmed by facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our fighters are hurt when a wrong analysis is submitted to senior policymakers,” said Ken Calvert, a Congressman and Republican from California.
Failure in the leadership of Centcom goes to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the persistent problems of the headquarters in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration ordered the reports to be amended, the report says analysts felt that they were under pressure from the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the headquarters, statements and statements from Congress were substantially more positive than what events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a crucial military attack to seize Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, is still under Islamic State control.
“This is quite clear after months of investigation,” Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Republican Party from Kansas, said in a statement.
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, senior U.S. intelligence personnel manipulated the intelligence outputs of the U.S. headquarters in order to minimize the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans set up a working group after hearing about analysts’ concerns that intelligence information related to Islamic State is being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further investigations will be followed by more detailed investigations.
Centcom’s intelligence services are conducting further investigations led by the Defense Ministry’s Inspector-General.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which matched some of the findings of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling assessments of information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the Chairman of the Committee and Democratic Representative.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “led to distorting intelligence outputs,” damaged morality among analysts, and “failed to adequately take into account disagreement.”
Schiff and Democrats, however, say they have found no evidence that the White House has attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their findings according to “a proposal or a political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published on Tuesday in Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times on the ongoing investigation of the Pentagon’s inspector-general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Commander Lieutenant Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Defense Ministry would not comment on the parliamentary report as the investigation of the inspector-general is still ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Defense Ministry welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement now claimed by an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s accusations raised questions about how far President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Intelligence criticism of Islamic State has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush – despite the objections of many analysts – has defended a small unit in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the resistance against the Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities that Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements of the opposite, airstrikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group’s financial resources, as the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism last year after many lawmakers found the Senate testimony to be too positive for the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The U.S. won land hockey in its fourth game in a row, so today will be a decisive match for the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in the match against Japan, which ended with a win of 6:1, and just a day later for the American women's land hockey team scored the first two goals in the match, in which America defeated India 3:0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she wasn’t sure if she ever managed something like that.
“I have no idea,” she said.
I’m not one of those who write their notes.
But he knows this: the Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to the matches 4:0 and share the first place in the group with Britain, which remained on Thursday after defeating Japan 2:0 remained unbeaten.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who of the group of six teams will finish first and who will finish second.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the forefront of the second group.
Whatever the Saturday match ends, the Americans have stirred up with their surprising ride here, four years after they ended up among 12 teams at the Olympics in London.
There was also Bambi in the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first took land hockey in her hands when she was 3 years old (her older sisters twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn’t get to the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor her team members did much.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we did not have the same pace of work as we do today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bamova started in the first half by shooting a goal from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough andined a score of 1:0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bamova took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then clicked into the middle and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
The defeat of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first at the tournament.
He is in excellent form.
Just like Bam.
“Now we are in a good place,” Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the outcome of Saturday’s match.
Zen trampolines in the midst of Olympic rage
It doesn’t matter where you are, it doesn’t matter what time it is – it’s the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro is felt a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competitiveness and effort.
It’s as if the Olympic façade itself was a hot squat stick that passes from a lighter to a swimmer, a gymnast, and a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in a line in a cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the resentment between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming favorite of women with spots in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will sound out in households during the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsors spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a shermer.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic fire does not light on all competitions the same.
Far from the center, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air pistols, archery, badminton, taekvondo.
We’ll always have success in the classic swimming style – and it’ll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point out the unobtrusive charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping on the trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first featured at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed – many of the people I questioned didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
It can be regional indifference.
The United States has never won a medal in trampoline jumping, and until 2012 none of the athletes had even reached the final.
The prizes in the men’s category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women’s category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be defended by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But jumping on a trampoline has a lot to do with it, partly because the ear of the unconscious will seem more suitable for a clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but just an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has a comic potential – comic vibrations of endless reflection – but also the kindness of gymnastics and diving, two sports it combines.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampolín”, which means “skating board.”
The aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline that will shoot them up to almost 10 meters in height and demonstrate sets with several elements (salt, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are rated by design, difficulty and "time in the air".
There will be 32 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is ahead.
Fighters for gold medals have to go further, faster and higher, sometimes to the end, other times back and forth, up and down.
They try to catch up not only with the target tape or the start wall, but, as the TV news reports, also with another imaginary line: a world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical — and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The trail of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
The point is not moving forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, difficulty, it is not possible, but for the duration of the composition, there will be no fierce struggle to reach the goal, no measurement of distance, but only a perfect, fine support of time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the Olympics and Zen approach.
The women’s qualifying and final will take place on Friday afternoon at 13 a.m. Eastern time, and the men’s competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the final in the afternoon block, which begins at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably ignore despite other battles.
And if attention is to be achieved only by making male athletes the subject of loving views and materialization – as the US gymnast recently suggested by the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to lap their breath.
“Protesting Generation” in Ethiopia, a longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have encountered violent resistance from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were killed during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
Over the past decade it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been hit by anti-government riots, which are spreading to more and more areas.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets last week demanding major political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses say police shot and killed unarmed demonstrators.
Circulating video footage of the protests, probably from late last year or early this year, captures security forces beating young people with sticks after they were forced to stand by the wall on their arms.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to move forward,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, are receiving such aid from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has developed at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has been substantially improved – a new suburban train is even running in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy – human rights organizations are constantly talking about governmental repression – the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them were deported, imprisoned, killed or expelled far into the desert.
However, this can change.
“When you stifle people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the youths protest.
A whole generation protested.
The complaints are numerous and concern everything from land disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent of the parliament.
At the same time, pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing.Conflict along this inaccurate, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitics fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past few years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of the confusion and re-armed themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have burned up again.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even though the government will ban access to Facebook or Twitter, as is commonly done mostly during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxy that will hide the location of those people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for protests.
There is also greater solidarity between Oromas and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromes and Amhares are not natural allies.
For many ages, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian mountains of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and commerce and have exploited the Oromas, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that is also changing.
“We are on the way to united leadership,” said Orom leader Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigris ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, was the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unnamed illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see beyond the corner.
Analysts say he was skillful in detecting initial signs of dissatisfaction and used ambassadors to process and win opponents to his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new prime minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who originated in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they don’t trust the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots was in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government cracked down and then stole.
A harsh raid followed, during which many protesters were killed — though fewer than in recent months — and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train, and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual rise of conflict within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, demonstrators in the Amhara city of Gondar attacked business firms owned by Tigris, and anger against Tigris on social media is becoming more and more common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an unpleasant situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to break up in an already volatile region.
“That,” said Abdi, “is a very sharp edge of the blade.”
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and ISIS financing as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to underestimate the latest controversy flooding his campaign by saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an unpleasant situation, who have diligently defended him in a stormy time and must explain that he may not have taken his comments seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in talks that he did not actually intend to say that the president and H. Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump stated that he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old one-day claim, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the note by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not react.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy as his preferences in polls decline.
Trump and Clinton are taking part in an economic duel in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax increases, and said some said her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm to defend himself.
At the end of July, when he raised a wave of criticism when he proposed that Russians should penetrate Clinton’s emails, he later explained his comment by saying, “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and temper them as needed.
"I think it's his way of testing to what extent some messages have a response from his supporters to see how they react, and according to the response then one way or the other "explaining," said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who tracked the language both candidates used.
But I also think he is skillful in his statements and knows they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As the results of polls in his favour continue to decline, Trump has chosen an even more sluggish tone in recent days, instead of softening things for the general voter.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, published on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and far behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with how Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his devoted followers in a discomforting situation, who have to stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he says is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, IS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he mistakenly called a newcomer, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to aggressively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to shoot the media around him on Twitter for removing every word he said and being obsessed with him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television scholars who tried to understand him and said, “They can’t!”
Several Democrats blunted Trump’s apology, saying it was just another proof that he wasn’t eligible for the presidency.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the market price. now it is back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shady place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pressed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the shape of cakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel looted, and the Verb is now a soap shop.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original cafe, who is both the owner and CEO of the new location.
In Verb started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his clients offered to pay for moving to a new place, he said he would do so with pleasure.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even re-used the lighting from the old Verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
The menu includes sandwiches with shunks, eggs and cheese and toppings such as caprices and fried onions.
You will also find a dish with brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of original stamgasts.
“A number of original customers have also had to move out of Williamsburg because of prices,” he said.
Last Sunday there was one such customer, Rebecca Oliveir.
Ms. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequently visited the Verb Cafe.
It even happened after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found out that what I love is coffee and culture in Verbo,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day, instead of her usual ice coffee, she made a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been dedicated to Verbo since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
“I come here every day at four and eight o’clock, like a clock, and they’re already preparing my hoodie with everything and butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order as usual, but occasionally lets him put bacon, eggs, and shunks on his hood with everything.
Rodriguez said he wasn’t sorry that the soap store took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
“I think we could still take advantage of it,” Rodriguez said.
Also the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint cafe received well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place to show it soon so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
A local fruit juice producer wants to turn into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility to expand the cafe into the neighboring building.
A lot of customers want to get their old favourite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, he was told he had his heart broken.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe opens again, entering and drinking coffee is like coming home.
“I missed that smell,” he said.
Depressive Food from the Crisis – in the “Square Meal”
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Office and eating lunch.
President Roosevelt tasted selected foods from 5th Avenue, such as goose butterfly pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: eggs in paradise sauce in the evil way, potato pudding and slime pudding as a dessert.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, is devoted to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book “97 Orchard” tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, A Square Meal, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s sandwich store, a small buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane, 54, ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with crushed olives, Andrew, 57, ordered a crocodile, potato flour and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carpet that, according to the couple, was great for talking about food during the crisis.
“The cakes were very popular,” Ms. Ziegelman said.
They sold beans, beans and beans.
They were made from the mixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Determine the amount of beets you will have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe is upset.
“They would lie in your stomach like lead,” he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet, eat what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers, and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal follows the ways a nation was dealing with when it suddenly wasn’t a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods spread, such as cakes and cakes, cakes as “a wonderful way to take advantage of the residues,” Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unesthetic ingredients under the layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the central point of American food - has become a sparingly allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures intended to serve as a calorie and nutritional filling preferred the taste or even common sense when cooking.
During research for a book that contains recipes, Miss Ziegelman prepared a time meal of baked onions filled with burdock butter.
“It wasn’t a favorite addition to the dinner table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said: “It was surreal.”
Burdock butter and baked onions do not go together.
It was typical of many home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of Domestic Economy from 1923 to 1943—drived the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the budget, and slices like cream spaghetti with carrots turned into tasty foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delights.
Especially desserts were created in the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s pose “I’ll give a cake.”
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he tabled as the chosen millionaire he became.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, such as fish with cucumbers sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in an almost golden room, wearing a smoking.
It was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn’t made him take the example of his own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who didn’t care about the taste at all. This led to the White House “not only serving almost the dullest food in all Washington, but also prepared in the most unpleasant way.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis vanished as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link has remained in our constant investigation of calories and nutritional values, says Mrs. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they better understood Miss Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits – why she couldn’t throw away food.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled: “People were bad about it.”
There was an accident with the wreath.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the silk dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called silk cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, only slugs, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly wrapped a teaspoon into a thick brown matter.
Surprisingly it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And, as a good host, he said to his wife, “It would be good to have a little sliced dryer.”

Most of the refugees coming to Europe come for economic reasons.

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in the case of a patent against type C jaundice against Merck Group
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimburse the lawyer’s fees incurred in the proceedings concerning a patent against type C jaundice against the drug manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the ruling that Gilead had to pay $200 million for damages due to Merck’s breach of two patents in connection with the very successful drugs of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni was annulled after a federal judge found repeated illegal actions on Merck’s part, including swearing lies and other unethical practices.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a file on Thursday that Gilead is entitled to an exemption from fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of anti-yellow type C medicines, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owner of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed troops claim to have gained full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed military units have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city has left.
The forces have released more than 2,000 civilians detained by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income in the year and paid an actual tax of 34.2 percent.
Former President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the joint fund for lectures, and the former Foreign Minister granted $3 million in revenue from Simon & Schuster for her book on her work at the State Department.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine from Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
In contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreating from his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns even if they are not required by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
“Your move,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign supporter said on Twitter, linking to the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until audits were completed.
According to Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profits, charity contributions, trade transactions and various other relations, including with Russia.
Clinton posted a video on Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
He will address the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan on Thursday.
“She refuses to do what all other presidential candidates have done for decades – to publish their tax returns,” she said.
Politico that Trump paid no or very low taxes over the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist cited a number of tax advisors and accountants who say it may be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is advocating a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett, which would ensure that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year will pay a minimum tax of 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, at Clinton’s gathering in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is headquartered, Buffett called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he has also undergone an IRS audit and that Trump is “not afraid” of the Treasury, but of the voters.
Clinton’s campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
Clinton, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax returns show that unlike most Americans, Clinton’s salary is only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Conservatives in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human dwellings – throwing condoms filled with chilli powder on them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American ecological organization The Nature Conservancy, is promoting the practice and training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania on how to use this nonviolent four-step procedure to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them had previously used cops in their defense.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we have seen a change in behavior in these communities.People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Honeyguide Foundation Executive Director Damian Bell in a statement.
The first and second step is to light the passing elephant with a battery and launch the clutch.
If it does not prevent it, the so-called “chilli cloud” will be thrown out.
Chilli powder mixed with salt is packed together with petard in a condom, its end is folded so that only a knot looks out of it.
After the explosion, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chilli is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one swing is enough and the elephant moves in a different direction.
The last option is to fire fireworks, which will cause a loud, bright explosion.
A Jewish director relyed on a Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling to Israel at the “request” of the Arabs
A French film director of Jewish origin has stirred up the media after he found out that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin did not include a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee on a “request” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary about the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of hotel call codes.
However, the country was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director sought an explanation and addressed the problem to the hotel reception.
Lanzmann’s response was “shocking.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was “decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move made the director even more upset.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the Israeli call code be deleted,” Lanzmann quoted employees in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as a "great shame."
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
This in itself is a huge disgrace.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” he said.
The incident sparked a strong reaction online, people described it as a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” it reads in another post, pointing out that the hotel, which is located in the noble street Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel, the hotel quickly dismissed any accusations by describing the incident as a “disregard” and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" to not include Israel in the list of call codes, Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted a Kempinski hotel representative as saying.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Brazilian police use tear gas and rubber rockets against student protesters
Students and police clashed in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday, as students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber rockets against the protesters.
The problem worsened when government law enforcement tried to disperse the students, which ended up with police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin’s proposals include closing a hundred public schools and relocating 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were seen spraying inscriptions on the walls against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters marched out into the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, when the country’s Senate ruled on her prosecution.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70,9 percent over the past year.
As the ambassador said, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from the Russian companies that do business in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016 the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 percent compared to the same period of 2015 and reached the amount of $856 million.
Specifically, Russian exports to Iran jumped by 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jumping growth of trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of Iranian tourists to visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
Iran is among the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
We can safely say that the record number of Iranian tourists to Russia from last year will be surpassed,” he said.
At the same time, a relatively small number of Russians are visiting Iran, and the ambassador hopes there will be a change here.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Scottish Callum Skinner rushes home after the British win gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a male team sprint at the Rio Velodrome, when the trio of the WB team defended the 2012 London title.
The twenty-three-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he hit the goal and stole the victory from the favored New Zealand.
Britain surprisingly won four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of the modest sixth at the World Race Cycling Championship in March, even though Hoy in the meantime ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for specialized opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hinduism appeared on time.
After Hoye's departure, the place was also released, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes – who was the champion four years ago with Hoy – and Skinner broke an Olympic record in qualifying, but the trio took over in the first round New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his wheel, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation when Hindes went to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes came up on the stage, he didn’t let their eyes go.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, “It’s a lustful comparison.”
I am here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and defeated the best.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on track after a weak start.
The note was later withdrawn and the British opponents had no opportunity to appeal.
This time there was no such victory.
Hindes said, “With all those British flags on the tribunes, I felt like I was in London.”
Over the last three months, we have all been together.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven of the ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we are waiting for five successful days at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny demonstrated, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
That would then mean for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, and also has his birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred to British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) – a total of six gold and one silver medals.
No matter how much he earned today.
As next, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which begins today and will last for three more days.
A twenty-eight-year-old native from Bolton said, “I now enjoy this.
Team race is always the best.
You win along with others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knight’s title.”
This was the only medal race that day, but there were other good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-mile race.
They ended with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, set in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (22:42) will take place on today's second day of the race, which Wiggins will focus on.
Yesterday before the qualifying race he debated with the commissioners when the referees asked him to measure the height.
In a similar race for women, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-range of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating absolute predominance in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during the preparations for Rio.
In the background were dramatic events, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of giants like Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of races at the velodrome, the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing seems to be confirmed again.
The uncertain future of the Portland smelter after the end of the power supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum melting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain because of the power plant that supplies the company with electricity and which has informed the intention of one of the melting plant owners to terminate the electricity supply contract.
The move comes after the government of the state of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the granting of subsidies that keep the company running.
The fixed 20 year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland could be endangered.
Up to 2,000 jobs, directly or indirectly, could be threatened by the closure.
And because the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, further avalanche impacts can occur.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland plant is under construction and is in danger of closure.
This move follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to a strong Australian dollar and recently due to factory production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum melting plant from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects any of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words, the growing demand for electricity from the melting plant will continue,” she said.
AGL said the contracts are so-called “reassurance contracts” that should have come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will share the profit for the fiscal year 2017,” the power plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written up the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million “for the event that the termination would take place.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract “does not affect its ... ability to operate a melting plant or secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to start in November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tapestry in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL head Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a substantial decrease in demand on the market [electricity].
This would not be good for us as a producer,” he said.
Kendall isn't just the star of Kardashian's real estate TV show - she's now the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, the model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the front page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, brand ambassador to Estee Lauder, who performed at Fashion Week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page,” Kendall wrote.
The title page disclosure was followed by a bizarre (or simply a humorous continuation of Kardashian's?) inscenized video in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenner (the barmen Rob and Caitly and with them all the favorite uncle from the show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) had forgotten their sister's envelope, only to end the scene with a classic turn: they are preparing a secret party.
It’s a playful plot of almost every “birthday” piece of a children’s TV show (Seacrest says, “Did you think we forgot you?” with the sincere cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could feed on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue, we definitely entered the new era of Kardashians.
Kim’s older sister may have pushed Kendall to the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue’s headline is a different league.
The August issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which with its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a wide range of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that of the 832 pages in the last edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The revelation of the star that appears on the front page is eagerly anticipated, so it’s no wonder that in the past two years the magazine’s images have leaked even before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more “celebrity models” on the headlines than “celebrity models.”
Jennifer Lawrence, an Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she was honored by Lady Gaga.
But even though it’s very unlikely that Kendall—which the magazine describes as the “breakthrough model” of her generation—will fall into the first category, she’ll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor are they real estate stars, or the children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are proven talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is delighted with Jenner’s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in a reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria’s Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them “the girls of the moment.”
These feelings burned again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the real sense of the word.
He plays for Marc Jacobs.
Makeup by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford’s daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she acts in a reality show, just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Legal aid centers refuse 160,000 people annually
Every year, more than 160,000 most vulnerable citizens are denied legal assistance at community centres, and the sector itself is preparing for the consequences of further funding constraints on already overloaded services.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly older people, immigrants, workers at risk, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unfair displacement and so on—are rejected as they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to break, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centers, said that according to the latest comprehensive report by the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres, 5,000 people are found to be rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the cancellation of the federal government’s decision, the situation will worsen.
“Community legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who escaped from relationships with the perpetrator, people with excessive and paralyzing debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly fired – all of these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows they don’t have a chance to get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leading to the fact that thousands of more vulnerable people from Queensland will have to navigate complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Queensland Attorney General and Senator George Brandis to immediately stop this financial cuts so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government of the state received its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Prosecution against Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member allegedly targeted a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that a North Carolina operations director targeted a gun on a staff member during a jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court file delivered on Wednesday to a state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former state campaign software trainer.
Bordini said he had waited for months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that "it won't happen."
“Director Earl Phillip pointed his fingers to the pistol, put his right index on the trigger and pointed his head at Vincent,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, after a complaint with the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
“The weapons do not need to be fired in order to cause damage,” Bordini said in a lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate provoked an uproar when he told North Carolina voters that weapons owners and holders (which is regulated in the U.S. Second Amendment) could intervene if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could appoint their judges.
Trump’s campaign says the media pulled his words out of context and that Trump did not advocate violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for threatening personal safety, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, did not immediately respond to the request for comment.
The attempts to obtain comments from Philip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local intelligence branch in Charlotta, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympics.
The Olympics brought huge benefits to both Startford and East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, create 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people here who will think that Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be laughing at the world stage.
The questioners were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, and leave a legacy in skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has launched a £11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and budget, starting with the T5 terminal – which has been voted the best terminal in the world for five years in a row – to the T2 terminal, which has been built between the two busiest ranveys in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third ranway, which costs £16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games were a huge success for the UK, and I am confident the Heathrow expansion will be the same.
It is time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.

Adblock Plus - Facebook in the cat and mouse game in ad blocking
An attempt to bypass ad-blocking programs has become a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing, at least according to one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update the filters in their program and re-block ads on that social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the site are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have been bypassed.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad-blocking community and those trying to get around it has been going on since ad-blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix itself.
The fact that the company that owns the world’s largest social network has entered the war shows just how big a problem advertising blocking has become for the industry.
According to the study, Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters by around 200 million people worldwide last year – almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising profits, with 1,03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
A spokesman said the company is opposed to advertising filters on desktops because mobile advertising filters for mobile apps for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktops still represents profits high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people a better control over how their ads are displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block non-advertising content on the pages.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email.
Ad Blocking is a non-sensitive tool, so we’ve preferred to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A car crashed into a Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to the incident on Thursday morning, in which a woman was overtaken by several cars on the highway, who probably tried to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in Canton Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the perpetrator of the “desperate act” was lying in the dark on the road and was crossed by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a woman aged 49, wanted to kill herself and was struck by several cars, including a truck.
died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, they have still not all been identified.The police are urging these drivers and all others who have witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be determined whether any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
The prosecutor has to find out,” Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases in the past five years, drivers do not seem to be held accountable.
In both cases — one of which was a person walking on the highway — it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of charges of negligent killing after hitting and killing a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
In court, it was that the 22-year-old victim drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer — who responded to the emergency call — was walking in a reasonable way and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a favorite destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agencies (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague Pride.
This was announced by the Executive Director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková on Friday.
The sixth Prague Pride began on August 8, bringing the lives of lesbians, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people closer together.
Last year, approximately 35,000 people participated.
“Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, due to its high tolerance and a wide range of specialized enterprises,” Petříčková said.
According to a survey by the organizers, foreign visitors spend an average of SEK 3,100 per person per day.
Gay tourists are provided with special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price ranges with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Petříčková said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year.
It is attended by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the United States and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The culmination of the festival will be on Saturday a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Václavský náměstí to Letnou.
The parade, attended by thousands of people over the past few years, this year will honor with a minute of silence the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where a gunman shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt are celebrating 40 years.
Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot episode of this evening series directed by Lubomír Beneš premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the emergence of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries around the world, were drawn jokes by the artist and director Lubomír Beneš, who invented for a magazine with two puppies, Mr. Ouholíček and Mr. Sedlec.
Beneš then invited the collaboration of the playwright Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimír Jiránek and together they created the film Kuťáci.
Today's shape with yellow and red tricks and balls and radio was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak television began to emerge in the Prague Short Film.
Pat and Mat were given the names in 1985, this time it was directed for the short film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works with other creators continued, many of which were accompanied by Beneš's son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these craftsmen, to whom everything is filled under their hands, but they never get angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and craft enthusiasm and finally are satisfied with their work, which is demonstrated by the familiar gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and characters or other toys with the image of Pata and Mata are the hit of every toy industry.
A story for Fiji and for the two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
Both have a good ending.
So let’s see.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the world?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical girlfriend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on at the airports?
This is Friday’s website.
The first Olympic medal.
Fiji is a historic island state.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the team of Great Britain in the final of the Olympic Seven Rugby Tournament.
This is the first medal Fiji has won at the Olympics.
Waiting for the earnings of the first precious metal took sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympics was sent.
It is a great success for Fiji’s coach.
Ironically, it’s Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be happy unlike his countrymen.
"Let's play loosely and lightly and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history," he said before the final.
Fiji eventually dominated it sovereignly and a small country with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
This was by the French newspaper Le Monde.
Good luck and good luck for a little girl.
Two-year-old Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new girlfriend.
A girl who looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," the two-year-old rejoiced, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to remove the doll’s arms and legs and then sit together without prostheses.
Harmonia was diagnosed with meningitis B in less than a year of life, and doctors gave her only ten percent chance of survival.
There is nothing I would not love about her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He also has sight.
I saw her presenting herself to other children with the words Hello, I’m Harmony and I don’t have hands.
Look at the joy that the doll caused.
What do you spend the most at the airport?
According to CNN, people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
Hudson’s travel essential stores has released data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products customers buy most often in its airport stores.
Water was sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight of them were placed in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candy with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who closes the top 10?
One of the above things is not to be eaten.
According to CNN, the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
These magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign Savior.
We just went to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Vesselers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have ruled the double category without a steering wheel for seven years and have also confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the couple moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing the competition since 2009.
Rodrigu de Freitas won the 69th consecutive win in the final on Thursday.
In what are we different from others?
We’re just more beautiful, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we do nothing different from others.
We train hard, very hard.
And we’re constantly trying to improve our technique, that’s our philosophy,” Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is a two-foot and stochastic chaser, the academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and deals with finance, while Murray has a charitable boxing match behind him.
They don’t spend much time together outside of swimming.
Eric enters the boat essentially with the fact that we can’t lose.
We just go to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, Bond admitted, who even at a press conference pointed out that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He was always the first to answer and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, destroys opponents with calm force.
They move at their own pace, and although they are often not in the middle of the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to go the first mile in a row.
We are just trying to go at a pace that no one else can do.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said Murray.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the world championship.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the Golden Four without a steering wheel.
Just after an unexpected failure, the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later decided to move to the two without a steering wheel.
At the Olympics in London, they probably lost the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us and they didn’t ask us anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally fine,” Murray said.
We all want to be removed from the throne.
We always have that target on our back.
We are one step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated with CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could have prevailed.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotation rate of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once boasted a rare Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also looked at the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably drier than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to govern life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent thinner.
“In a GISS simulation, during a slow rotation, Venus exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This creates a thick layer of clouds that act like a umbrella and protect the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than on Earth at the moment.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to an evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably inhabitable in the past — over several billion years — it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of the greenhouse gas remained -- that's Venus as we know it today.
Researchers have published their findings from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche team, citing his inability to participate in the decision-making process on the team's issues.
Colorado executive vice president and general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have served as chief coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy said in a statement.
I’ve been thinking long and intensely over the summer about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations be consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakic, who accepted Roye on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
“Patrick informed me of his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to gain 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, defeated Minnesota in the first round of the play-off and during the last two years he has always played games after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and lacked five points to win a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, has won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Workers at North Sea oil platform resume talks and break strike
High-ranking negotiating officials said the strikes over wages for North Sea oil platform workers were interrupted, while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the oil field services company Wood Group have sporadically occurred on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-to-day meetings over the coming weeks, where we will try to look at problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they say was the first in more than 25 years, is a protest against wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company says further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market decline.
Shell, on the other hand, removed thousands of employees from its payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes – immediately following a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, an economic situation associated with Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest work disagreements of a generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just a few,” he said in a statement.
For comparison, $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea in 2016, while the average for the past five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measured the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiades
The Kepler Space Telescope’s latest mission to help astronomers is to obtain a near-complete list of the speed of rotation of the stars in the Pleiadian cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the star cluster rotate at different speeds, and also how the rotation time is related to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing our findings with other star clusters we can learn more about the relationship between star mass, its age and even history in its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Plejadic star cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have formed over 125 million years ago.
Now it turns the fastest.
At the highest speed of rotation, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As a star ages, its speed of rotation slows.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on the stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on the speed of rotation, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the larger do the piruets slower than the smaller.
“In the ‘balet’ of the Pleiades, we see that the slower-rotating stars are more massive, while the fastest-rotating ones are usually very lightweight stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
“Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions for younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their speed of rotation and so to speak “hang their dance shoes on their nails.”
Rebull and her colleagues have detailed the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualifying agreement necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it possible to work without applying for specialized training?
I am concerned that in the field I would like to work in, there is now a vacant job only in a somewhat more remote hospital, but in about half a year there could be a vacant place in another, where I would then like to work.
I don’t know how to resolve this problem over the past six months.
Answered by Mr. Wolf.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution regulated by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the improvement or deepening of the employee’s qualification.
Healthcare is under long-standing pressure not to conclude these agreements in order to ensure the mobility of healthcare professionals, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Law No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing the professional competence and specialized competence for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, the participation in specialization training is considered to be an advancement of qualification (not an increase).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
No legislation imposes an obligation to apply for specialized education.
The law only stipulates the conditions for applying for specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to exercise the profession of a physician already by completing the necessary university studies, even if under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a physician with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation where professional experience completed in another field of specialization may be included in the specialization training of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time spent elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner’s situation.
However, given the fact that I do not know the more detailed circumstances of this case, consultation with the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Professions) can be recommended, since the Ministry of Health provides by law advisory and consulting services related to the enrollment in the specialization education and its course.
The consultancy service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, whose member every doctor must be.
Syrian doctors in Halab are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has not made any effort to end the siege (of the rebel parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to promote the protection of civilians, according to a letter to the White House.
“We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again,” the doctors said.
The Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop every day for three hours the strikes in the Halab area to allow the safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire will be stopped.
U.N. Chief of Humanitarian Operations Stephen O’Brien welcomed the move, but stressed that a two-day ceasefire is needed.
The letter was sent to 15 of the 35 doctors operating in the rebel-controlled eastern Halab.
They write that during the five-year war, they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and observing how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate the population from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly disguised threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors noted.
Doctors said in the past month there were 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria, 15 of them on hospitals in which they work.
We are most saddened by the fact that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
There are small children coming to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don’t even have the necessary material to help them, doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns drowned when an explosion disrupted the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They took their breath and then their life ended—before it could actually begin, they reminded.
The Russian-backed army, loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian air forces, succeeded in breaking the siege on Saturday after three weeks and launching a counteroffensive.
Both sides subsequently received reinforcements in the city and its surroundings.
